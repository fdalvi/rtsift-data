My pretty pretty princess Mollie Mae would love to totally speak on this as she has first hand experience.
But I have decided to go ahead and write this review based on being the Mommy of said shih-tzu.
I went to Legacy Animal hospital because they offered a free check up and a free toenail clipping on groupon.
I went in taking my precious with me.
The facility was clean, the office staff friendly and accomodating.
They even have a fridge with capri sun and water for patients parents.
NICE!
Mollie saw Dr. Murratore, and was immediately comfortable with him.
I was impressed with the way he loved on my dog like he knew her forever kissed and hugged and petted.
They were insta-pals.
My first visit ended up in a minor surgery because Mollie has acid reflux which destroyed her teeth.
She had to have some dental work done.
Dr. Murratore gave me a quote and told me to bring her back.
The surgery took longer and was more extensive than they had thought and should have been more expensive BUT Dr. Murratore honored his quote (this means a lot to a single gal who doesn't have extra income)   He even told me he would finish her shots under that same quote when I brought her back as she could not handle any additional work after the surgery.
Mollie came home from surgery and was right as rain.
She really recovered quickly and her follow up visit?
She was totally excited to go.
Normally she is very skiddish about going places she doesn't know or like.
But Dr. Murratore made a believer out of HER and me ... A huge thank you to everyone at this clinic for really caring about pets ... and their owners!

"BEST VET IN VEGAS" Dr. Susie Costa - Fakler, D.V.M.
- Legacy Animal Hospital   Dr. Susie Costa has taken care of our dog (Fred a Rhodesian Ridgeback) for the past 4 years and we have always been treated with such great care, respect and love for our pet so I decided to Yelp about it.
I consider her to be the best vet in Las Vegas and she will always be our veterinarian as long as she is in Las Vegas.
Dr. Costa is especially good with our very large 118 lbs service animal.
She is not only exceptionally loving and attentive, but She is always well-organized, and offers the kind of personal care you can only get from a smaller operation.
(I've seen the back area, too.
) She is also very sensitive to weighing the benefits of a procedure versus the stress it would cause to the animal.
This professional veterinarian is a gift to the community.
PLUS, her prices are very reasonable.
I would highly recommend her!

So the time had come where I had to say goodbye to a fury child of mine.
I had an animal hospital in mind but figured I would call a few more (that received good reviews on yelp) just in case the price was a bit better..   An ice cube could have produced more warmth than the woman that answered the phone to "assist" me with my questions here at Legacy Animal Hospital.
The receptionist seemed annoyed that I was asking the prices for their services and stated that it would be "up to the doctor" if said services were needed or not.
I explained that my cat was at LEAST 16 years old, stopped, eating, along with some other health issues.
(All of this as I'm sobbing on the phone just trying to get the information out of my mouth).
The lady made it a point to say that if the services were NOT deemed "necessary", I would be charged the very minimum of $50 just for the "consultation".
I understand she is helping to run a business, but it's obvious that she is not a genuine animal lover.
I have read all of the other reviews and perhaps this woman at the front desk was having a bad day, but either way it upset me so much so I had to share the news with Yelp.
Hope future patrons of this establishment have a much better experience, on the phone and in person, than I did.

We brought our kitten (a 6 wk old stray we found in our front yard) in and she was seen by Dr. Costa.
We were less than impressed with her lack of warmth & caring for our little baby's situation.
We were told she was dehydrated and was put on IV fluids right away and should be kept kept overnight.
We were then told of the many tests she recommended, along with pricing like she was reading a fast food menu.
We told her we couldn't afford it, as I was unemployed, she then said we'll wait & see how she is in the morning and to call her @ 8:00 AM.
We did, there was no answer.
We called again @ 8:15, Dr was not available, we left a message.
We called again @ 10:15, not available.
We asked the Receptionist to go take a look at her, she said she was sleeping.
We called back AGAIN and was told that Dr Costa said she was "hanging in there", she did not come to the phone.
Finally got a call back and was told that she was "miserable", had diarrhea and was throwing up and since we couldn't afford to have the many, many tests that she recommended the day before, she said that "putting her to sleep wouldn't be wrong"!!!
We were heartbroken & appalled that she didn't seem to think she had a chance.
We went over and picked her up right away and decided to wait 24 hrs and see how's she's doing.
Dr Costa gave us no recommendations or advice at all, just said "good luck" and left.
Our kitten started eating canned food and drinking formula right away, she never threw up once after we took her home and the diarrhea was gone 2 days later!!
Here we are 12 days later and she is happy & healthy...running around and playing, her coat is shining and her eyes look great!!
The idea that a Professional Vet is out there recommending a death sentence for pets that can be saved is disgusting to us.
How many people in our situation have done what she suggested and put their beloved baby's down simply because they couldn't afford the obviously unnecessary tests she was recommending?

I'm a first time pet owner and have loved working with everyone at Legacy Animal Hospital.
I wish I could find a doctor for myself that I liked this much!
The entire staff is delightful, including the awesome groomer.

We love Legacy.
We moved here in the fall and our dog has Diabetes.
They diagnosed her with a thyroid issue as well and adjusted some of her meds and she has been doing really well.
Everyone there is super nice and helpful and we really appreciate the service.
Oh, and Dr. Terry is awesome!

We recently moved to Henderson from the Midwest, and my first goal as a new resident was to find the perfect vet for our two small dogs (a Shih Tzu and a Bichon/Poodle).
I am EXTRA picky about who I will let take care of my babies, and searched and searched before settling on Legacy.
I drive past a few other vets to get there, actually.
I take my pups to see Dr. Costa, and she is absolutely AMAZING, as are all of the other employees there.
They are always warm and loving to the dogs, and are always very pleasant to me, also.
Dr. Costa is very knowledgeable, and is so patient with my 20 questions at every visit.
She understands how much these babies mean to me, and goes out of her way to make sure I am 'in the know' and comfortable in all situations.
Here's one simple example: When our Bichon/Poodle didn't fare too well during her spay and was too uncomfortable to come home with me the night following her surgery, Dr. Costa called me to talk about the benefits of keeping her there to get some extra rest, and assured me she would be checked on throughout the night.
Apparently Dr. Costa could tell from my tone that I was sad to leave her there overnight, worrying about how she was doing since I couldn't seen her.
So, after I hung up with her, I received a photo text on my phone from the Dr., with a picture of my baby girl, doing just fine and resting in her kennel.
I slept in peace that night, and so did our pup.
Definitely above and beyond on Dr. Costa's part.
I also take both of my pups here to be groomed by Kelley.
She's so good with both of them, and they always come out looking gorgeous!
Long story short - if you're looking for a friendly, intelligent, wonderful place to take your animals, I'd recommend Legacy any day.

Dr. Terry Muratore and his staff do such a GREAT job.
They really do amaze me!
They are compassionate, caring, and they help animals find a home as well.
Every time I am there, they are trying to get a stray adopted.
They have good hearts.
The place is clean.
I have had my cats groomed there over the years as well.
I admit, I have had some bills there that would choke a horse, but there have been several times when I thought it was something serious, and it was next to nothing.
When Harry King retired(he was the original owner)I was devastated.
Then Dr. Muratore actually took service there to a new level.
Windmill and Pecos, 263-9004.

I took my tabby for his shots(1 year old)  This is the 3rd cat, Terry(Doc) has dealt with.
The other two lived to 20 and 21 years old thanks to him and his wonderful, caring staff.
Sure, they are always busy, but that's because Terry is that damned GOOD and that damned reasonable!
I thought Misa was sick, turns out nothing was wrong, thankfully.
How many vets are THAT honest and compassionate?
He is always getting strays adopted and truly cares for ALL animals.
He is the most honest, caring vet I have ever had.
I have had cats for 35 years, and Terry is the BEST there is...PERIOD!
There is no regret when you make him your vet.
263-9004, corner of Windmill and Pecos, near Del Taco!

Dr. Terry Muratore is awesome.
I've been bringing dogs to him for over 10 years and I wouldn't go anywhere else.
He's patient, super approachable, great with my dog, and he takes the time to explain everything.
Most importantly, he really knows what he's talking about.
I always know my dog is in good hands with Dr. Muratore!

This is my story and you can draw your own conclusions.
Our cat was an outdoors cat, after six years of going outside she came home with a big gash on her belly.
The wound area and her leg were swollen and bloody.
My partner rushed her to the vet, and Dr. Costa received her.
She told my partner that she will stitch her and everything will be fine.
Which gave us so much hope; because we thought her condition was fatal, that's how bad it was.
She had been like this for four days before she made it home and we feared the worst.
After the surgery, the vet told us that she had to cut a lot of flesh to get rid of the dead tissue but that she will be fine.
My partner came to visit her and the assistant brought her out holding her by the upper body letting the belly with stitches and wound drainage hang, like if this would be a perfectly healthy animal that didn't go through trauma the previous day.
My partner had to tell her, can you please handle her gently.
When I went in to see her, the attendant was more delicate, but this is not even the point.
When I saw my kitty she was in excruciating pain, she smelled as if she was rotting from the inside out, (she didn't smell like this when we first brought her in, but we understand that her condition could have deteriorated even after surgery).
My partner and I prepared for the worst, but the vet looked me in the eye and told me that in the worst case scenario she would have to do another surgery to remove more dead tissue, which I was fine with, because money was not an issue.
She even said I might be able to take her home in two days.
We brought her in on a Thursday, we visited her Friday and Saturday, on Sunday the vet called us to let us know that she was improving slowly, but she still had a fever.
On Monday, I called twice in the morning to enquire about her health.
They told me Dr. Costa will call me when she had a chance.
She called at 4.50 pm, and told me that my kitty had eaten a little by herself, that the fever was going down and that the second surgery was most likely going to be necessary and to call her the next day to discuss that.
I was very happy with the news obviously.
At 5.20pm I received another phone call from the Dr. Costa saying that she went to feed her, she took a breath and collapsed and she couldn't find a heart beat.
THIRTY MINUTES after getting a good prognosis my cat died.
Needless to say I'm devastated, hurt, enraged and feel cheated.
My kitty suffered a lot,  I feel that she wasn't handled properly, they didn't even put a cone collar to prevent her from licking the wounds, which I see all the time on sick pets, including my neighbor's kitty when he was neutered, which is a simple procedure.
This facility is too busy, they can't offer a personalize service, and I don't trust this vet.
I will never take another pet there.

I have been a long time goer to this establishment from when I was a child with family pets to now living on my own with my own pets.
I currently have an Irish Wolf Hound mix (Dakota) and a Snow Shoe Siamese cat (Rogue).
The dog is 10 years old while the cat is 2 years old.
The receptionists are very friendly and will greet you upon entering and they even have a greeter dog named Cheeto.
Dr. Costa has been my primary Vet since obtaining both my animals.
She has dealt with Rogue since she was a six week old kitten and Rogue is a very picky cat.
She doesn't like most human beings outside of me and does not like being held outside of me either.
Dr. Costa has such a genuine touch that she has been able to pick up Rogue and calm her down in order to trim her nails down.
I've very happy to have the ability to have a Vet like that.
Recently, our dog Dakota had a tumor coming out of her eye.
Not only was Dr. Costa successful in getting rid of the tumor, but she also during time of operation cut off a skin growth, cleaned Dakotas teeth, and removed a bad tooth.
She took amazingly good care of my elderly dog and also kept it at an amazing price.
This staff is this whole hospital is amazing---receptionists, vet techs, and vets alike.
BTW, they also have a Pet-Portal Website which is able track and log your pets information.
Legacy is connected to this and will send you emails when its time for shots and vaccinations.

This place is the worst animal hospital I have ever taken a pet to in my life.
The office staff is rude and unhelpful.
The Dr. told me to call if I had any problems and I did  he NEVER called back I called three times and no call back.
My pets are my family and this place only cares about making a buck not the well being for your pet!!!!!!!!
Believe me the office staff will remind you it is all about the money not the care of your pet.
very disappointed...

We were referred here by the Southern Nevada Beagle Rescue, and what a lovely place.
The receptionists are all friendly, and take the time to know our dog by name.
The vet techs are always happy to help with whatever we need.
Most importantly, Dr. Susie Costa is the best!
She is warm, compassionate, and willing to spend the time necessary to answers questions and put us pet parents at ease.
Never once has she recommended any unnecessary or over the top procedures or medication.
We have also taken advantage of the overnight boarding service several times, and it was always a great success.
I've had dogs my entire life, and I can say I have never found a clinic quite as wonderful as this place.

We Love Dr. Costa.
We have take both of our dogs there several times.
One time the dogs got in a fight and the next morning one of the dogs eye was the size of a golf ball - Dr. Costa said she didn't think she needed stitches and to give her antibiotics and call in a few days if she's not better, and she was ( I strongly believe she is not just in her profession for the $...unlike other Vets - she Really cares.
and her staff is very helpful - they are Very busy so give them a break...).
Most vets would have just cut above the eye, removed the puss and stitched her up.
But Dr. Costa knew our financial situation at the time.
Now I have to have my dog put to sleep.
We took her to Dr. Costa because all of a sudden she had horrible breath - she was diagnosed with jaw cancer.
We were given an option of having the effected part of her jaw removed, along with radiation, but she is 13, lived a great life and I wouldn't want to put here through that.
I would never go to anyone else: 1.
Because of Dr. Costa's caring demeanor 2.
My dog knows and trusts her 3.
The price is very reasonable.
Also, my dog ran out of one of her pain medications and Dr. Costa told me that someone had donated some, so I got it for free!
Something I would have never thought of, but I will donate the remaining medications when our dog is put to sleep in a few days.
PLEASE DONATE ANY UNUSED PET MEDICATIONS YOU HAVE RECEIVED FROM LEGACY IF YOUR ANIMAL PASSES - IT CAN REALLY HELP SOMEONE OUT IN NEED!

Our two dogs have been seeing Dr. Costa for two years.
She is our vet of choice for checkups, emergencies, anything pet related.
Dr. Costa is an excellent vet.
She is punctual, thorough, very knowledgeable, and loving to our two pups.
During one emergency visit she was able to see our pup right away and took very good care of him.
On another visit she fixed a botched surgery that another vet had performed.
We highly recommend her.

Dr. Costa has been my best friend's doctor since she was a puppy.
Not since Dr. Costa was a puppy, but since my dog Isabella was a puppy.
This is where my parents and I have taken our dogs for several years.
Not once have we ever had a problem or issue with the price or care we've received.
I'm sure my dog would write a different kind of review considering she gets fingers up the rectum every visit.
Poor girl.
Nothing a stop through the Wienerschnitzel drive-thru can't fix.
If your dog has been acting emo and writing negative diary entries about their vet than maybe it's time you take action and give Legacy a shot.
Health and happiness could be just a vet call away.

Both Dr. Muratore and Dr. Costas are fabulous.
They are throughout and thoughtful.
I highly recommend this clinic especially for bully breeds!

Great experience!!!
The petite brunette vet tech at the front (I forgot to get her name) was absolutely lovely and sweet as can be.
The Dr. was very honest and forward.
Never once felt like we were being sold on anything.
Great experience.
Thanks, we will definitely be back.
