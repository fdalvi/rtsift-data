OK, as you can guess I am a fan of online shopping deals.
Well, Brads Deals (check them out) had on the web a few days ago a min-cupcake maker from Kohl's for a great price, so I ordered it...
In about 4 days we received the brand new cupcake maker.
Went to the store with the wife and bought some cake mixes and started the process.
The lights came on the machine but no heat (oh no) glad we didn't add milk to the cake mix.
So this morning I returned the cupcake maker to the nearest Kohl's...  "NO ISSUE" they exchange the non-working unit for a brand new one off the floor.
Now looking forward to mini-cupcakes tonight... Glad I bought it from a major retailer...

Good deals!
No long lines, staff was helpful!
Got to use my kohl bucks and spent almost next to nothing on pjs for Christmas!
Happy we stopped by here!
Wasn't all crazy everyone was cordial, and was in and out in 20 mins with everything we needed!
Store was clean and you could still find where everything was at, happy with this visit!

usually have great clearance racks makes their stuff more afforable.
never can find staffing though
