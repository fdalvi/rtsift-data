It was so funky to see Betsey Johnson's store here.
Although I will never wear Betsey, I know lots of my friends do love her stuff.
Funky colors, bold styles, everything a strong personality would love to don.
I can't believe there is more than one store on the strip, but then again, this is Vegas after all.
Friendly staff even if you're just browsing.

There was a salesgirl named Jen here and she was great!
She was this little bubbly thing and helped me get into my size four birthday dress........thanks!!!!!

I went here for the buy one get one sale they were having last weekend.
I usually get my Betsey dresses secondhand, but I thought I ought to get my earrings in the store.
The store was pretty empty when I got there, which was great.
Sometimes, they are just so crowded!
It's hard to fit that many girls in a tiny store.
): The dressing rooms are cute and giant.
The dresses are hundreds of dollars.
The earrings start at twenty-five dollars and are unbelievably cute.
I had a hard time choosing, but a woman who was excitedly taking advantage of the sale helped me out.
Thanks, girl!
I was pleased to see that the sales girls had a box full of prepackaged earrings, so when you pull them off the rack, they give you a new pair that nobody's touched and you don't have to wonder if you missed any designs because somebody just bought it.
It's expensive, but if you've got the money, I can't think of a better place for party dresses!

The sa's here are so cute!
We even got into a discussion about betsey johnson's in california, even when I only planned to skim some dresses and bounce!
Very friendly staff and large selection of dresses, and even more on sale most of the time!

I was on my way to a club around 10:30 on Saturday night, when I realized that they don't open until 11 PM.
I had a little time to kill.
I was walking through Planet Hollywood and spotted Betsey Johnson.
I literally gasped.
I've always loved her dresses but hadn't been to a store.
I walked in and was in awe at the amazing dresses.
I found one I wanted to try on, they had it in my size in another color.
They were having an amazing sale.
I put it on hold and went back the next day to buy it.
Okay, of course I love the dresses or I wouldn't have gone in.... but Katie.
I had so much fun trying on dresses with her help.
Literally, I couldn't zip them on my own.
Katie gave honest opinions and figured out how much it was going to run me.
She was amazing.
Had I not met her I might not have walked out of there with a $400 dress under my arm.
Thanks for the dreamy pretty in pink fashion show Katie!
Love you!

I stopped in this store - they were having a BOGO sale - I totally would have picked up something...but they only had one item that I really wanted, and I didn't have time to go through everything...
I love Betsey and the girls here were fantastic - I wish I had more time...next time I'll carve out some time to spend here.
