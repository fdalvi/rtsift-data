This isn't the kind of place I would usually go into, but for Yelp I made the effort.
I walked in to find the entire bar watching a darts game between 2 of the locals...  Me and my friend grabbed a seat in the corner and had a little chat.
Suddenly an old man who was flirting dangerously close to jaundice, interpreted me and asked, no, plain told me to keep it down.
Apparently whispering put off the darts players.
I finished my drink and made my way out.
If you like sitting watching darts and not communicating with your loved ones, I recommend here!
