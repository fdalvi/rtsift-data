Great craft beer selection and friendly staff.
I bought a number of singles here and the guy was nice enough to throw in ice to keep it cold on the trip home to Mpls.
Also, cool artwork for their logo.
Worth the stop!

Have stopped here a few times over the past year.
Most recent visit was 12/30/13.
+ Easy to get in and out of + Plenty of parking + Wrap-around beer coolers have great selection of local & national micro brews + Decent selection of imported brews + Carries standard macro brews  + Full service liquor store (liquor, wines, snacks) - Wine selection is a bit light, but is sufficient for grabbing a quick bottle or two  + Super friendly and helpful staff + Well lit, logically laid out + Standard prices + Takes credit/debit/cash  Great store.
I'd recommend checking them out.

From the outside it seems like sort of an inner-city type store but once you get in everyone's really friendly and helpful.
They always have exactly what you need and the prices seem reasonable.
They have everything from reasonably priced booze to upscale liquors and I really like the place it's my go to liquor store.
