They have a fast turn around and can get spots out as long as you tell them about them on drop-off.
Staff is very friendly and prices are reasonable.

Decided to give this place a try, and deviate from my normal 2 star location across the street from Mom and Pops Cleaners.
The clothes and uniform I picked up were cleaned and pressed properly and on time.
The price was pretty good, and less then across the street.
The cashier didn't have a personality, which I actually found funny.
In the end, it doesn't matter much because its a quick stop.
I may have found a new dry cleaners.

The ladies here are calm and honest.
Prices are decent, definitely worth the dirty expensive clothes I've thrown at them almost twice a week!
I've recommended them to everyone who asks about dry cleaners!
