Fast food is fast food, you can't compare it to a "real" restaurant.
However, in comparison to other Taco Bell's, this one has been much better than so many others.
They're quick, and the order is always correct.
The food is exactly what I would expect it to be when I decide to come here.
That's all I can ask for.
If I wanted a sit down meal, I'd go elsewhere, but for drive-thru service, I couldn't ask for anything more.
I would say that 99% of the time, the person I speak with is friendly and smiling.
I find it makes me smile back, and that's always a good thing.
The food is good and takes care of those cravings we sometimes get.
I know what I like here, and as long as I get what I want, I'm a happy camper.

Slowest taco bell I've ever been to.

Not all Taco Bells are the same.
I don't know what has changed in the last year or so, but this location is soooo sloooow.
Several times I have had to wait 15 minutes in the drive thru after placing my order when there were two cars ahead of me.
Today, I ordered a mexican pizza and a potato soft taco and they were both tasting of stale oil.
Potatos were dry too.
I give up on this location.
