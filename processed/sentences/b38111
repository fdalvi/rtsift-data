I do like this location for SMA because I have had better luck getting seen the same day when booking an appointment.
Finding parking is so much easier.
Wait time not too long.
Even when my dr. was behind 25 minutes I still was seen within an hour.
Downside, its a smaller facility, hours are limited and providers here are transient.
The last doc I saw said she was only here temporarily.
It caused a delay in getting my prescription refilled since she was no longer there to approve it.
I  just happened to be in the Lake Mead shopping center and decided to drop in and see if they could speed up the process.
Sure enough the receptionist that greeted me was able to have another doctor approve it right then and there and rX was sent to my pharmacy.
Didn't need any appointment, didn't have to call and deal with voice mail jail.
Got the email from my pharmacy to pickup within that hour.
So Im satisfied with the service provided here so far.

Very pleased with the location, I was seen promptly, the front desk staff and back office staff was very friendly and the facility was very clean.
What more could I ask for?
