I've been going here for 10 years.
My relationship began when I needed a bunch of clothes tailored for my first trip to Europe.
I needed everything quickly and was very specific.
She got everything done in time for my trip.
Over the years I've brought dozens of clothes.
She's done everything from changing a dress into a top to adding bra pads to a cocktail dress.
She's hemmed and taken in.
She's shortened straps and helped me change out fabric in clothing to create a completely different look.
I can communicate anything I want and she'll have it done exactly the way I envisioned it.
We've been able to change things so much we sometimes recreate new looks.
Her prices are a little high but well worth the quality.
Every single person I've recommended has been extremely pleased with her work.

I love this place!
It's out of the way from both home and work, but I will not take my clothes anywhere else!
the owner is a very nice lady!

It felt as if I was her first and last customer of the day.
She tried to charge absurd amount for money for ordinary services.
Go there and see it for yourself.

She did a little bit on my wedding dress and altered a bridesmaid dress for me and she's awesome!
She is really funny and a pleasure to go see.
My whole family goes to Q and only Q; we love her!
