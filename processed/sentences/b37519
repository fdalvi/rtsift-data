Customer Service is great

this place was clean, people were fun and my nails look great.
The design is really nice and the price is great!

I love this place!
Randy does my nails, my sisters and several of my friends!
He always does an amazing job and he is so fun to be around!
:) very reasonably priced!!!

One of the worst nail places that I've been too.
I went in to get a simple gel take off since I was too lazy to do it myself.
They soaked fingers in some pink solution...
It literally dyed my nails, cuticles and finger tips PINK!!
It wouldn't wash off for days!
She broke two of my natural grown nails in the process.
I was especially pissed at that because it too me forever to grow them!
The lady also rushed my take off...
But for what?
I'm the only one in there!
Will never be coming back.
Service and customer service was HORRIBLE.
