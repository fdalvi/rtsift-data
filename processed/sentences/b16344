This shop is really good.
I took my car there for the second time, and they do a consistently good job.
One of my wires got too old and melted, which ended up messing up part of a job that they did six months ago, but they up warrantied the old job for me anyway and fixed the new issue, saving me big time.
Also, when they called to tell me my car was done, and I mentioned i was not sure when I could come and get it, they offered  to come pick me up.
Good prices, great same-day work, great service.
Highly recommended.

I have a 2000 gmc 4X4 with a 6.0L.
The mechanic Sergio replaced my radiator, water pump and thermostat.
They did a excellent job, fast same day service.
They also gave me a ride home and picked me up.
Great job, Thank you.
