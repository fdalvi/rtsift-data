An OK kinda joint.
Was empty when i walked in.
Humm... Not necessary a good sign.
Alright, screw it i'll do it, its just hair, it'll grow back right?
So, i hop in a chair right away and some dude starts hacking away, mostly using a buzzer.
Bzzzrr, bzzzrrrr.
20 or so min later i am done.
Military style, huh?
Not exactly my cup o tea, but what could i expect when i asked for a short haircut?

This is a guys place.
Sit down and talk about sports.
Heck even the owner Tanya can hang in the conversation.
Manny is who I go to and either one of them has the fade down to a science.
Then you will enjoy a straight razor shave on your neck.
This barber shop is reasonable and your cut will be on everytime.
no hack jobs here I have been going to this shop for more than 5 years.
Excellent

This is a wonderful barbershop with great prices .
It's staffed with only two barbers who've been in the business for nearly 20 years.
They have an extensive and loyal customer base and are on a first name basis with all their regulars, gives it that neighborhood feel that you don't get at the chain cutters or over priced mega salons.
I've been a customer since the early '90s and always look forward to chewing the fat with the other regulars.
Watch out what you say about the Dallas Cowboys, the owner is a huge fan.

My boyfriend gets his haircut here and so I am writing the review for him.
He went back to this place after a few years of being gone and he had forgotten how great this place is.
He said he wouldn't go anywhere else again.
Highly recommend!
