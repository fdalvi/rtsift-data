Signed up for Direc TV through their salesman Steve.
He was genuinely concerned about helping me find what would work for our family and answered all my questions and got me a great price!
TV works great, installation was easy and quick.
Seriously no complaints.

They knock on doors trying to sell services, despite having a No Soliciting sign posted right next to our door bell.
Then they were rude when I asked them to go away because I didn't want to hear their speech.

This is the shadiest company I have ever worked for.
I had to quit after the way they handled an 80 year old lady.
They lie to get in houses and stay there with other service providers.
Do not do business with these people and do yourself a favor if you're thinking about working for them, get a job somewhere else.
Super shady company.
If you have activated service with them I would call and cancel.
Complain to DIRECTV Corp about their business practices.
If you are a customer or somebody they are harassing to buy their services.
