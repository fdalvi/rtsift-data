Awesome burgers.
Juicy and tasty.
Fries are wonderful too.

great burger, love the fries!

I go here probably once a week, and just want to write that this has some of the best service out there.
I tend to order random items, ask for things like extra patties that aren't on the menu, and they NEVER Mess up my order.
Are always courteous, polite,  and a few even recognize me.
Just want to give them an A+ on food and service

The hamburgers and fries are always great.
The reliability and taste are very nice.
We usually get the small fries with Cajon on the side.
It's just enough for two.
We will continue to eat here and at other locations for many meals to come.
