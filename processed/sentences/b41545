This company does bait and switch.
I went twice for the same car advertised on line the third time I had just left and called to see if they had the car I was interested in and they said yes they had it.
LIE....They do not speak English very well and were more interested in getting food from a street vender on a bike.

The place seems decent until you have to deal with the dishonest twerp of a finance guy.
I don't remember his name... A young punk with braces and a speech impediment.
He actually said to me, "You have no way to prove what we offered you for your trade in," right after the salesperson confirmed how much they offered me.
He was so incompetent that he couldn't even remember what was said multiple times during the conversation.
If he's not related to someone that runs the place, then they'd do good to get rid of him and find someone that knows how to speak to a customer.
And don't bother looking at their website to see what they have.
They don't update it, and they certainly don't remove cars they've sold from it.
Even a month after it's off the lot.

wish there was negative stars.
They messed up my god for nothing warranty only fixed it after contacting BBB.
Why does it matter they gave me the car fax, lies.
I had to take it back to them within a week for brakes and rotor.
Then 2 months later got brakes again from somewhere else.
Now after having it a year and only putting maybe 6,000 miles the abs system is down (lights been on since they fixed brakes they said its nothing) and I was asked how bad the accident was I was in?
I wasn't.
yep more $$$$.
I will be trading it in and losing a ton.
Do not buy from here
