John was great.
I called him to ask him some weird questions about stuff we need for a trade show in Vegas, and he was helpful, and gave me some great advice!
Sadly, my vision is not feasible due to the global helium shortage, but he had some great suggestions for other ideas to try.

John was great and really accommodating to our event.
He always responded promptly and was very informative when answering my questions.
We order jumbo balloons and they were gorgeous!
His balloons are beautiful!
I can't say that enough!
I would definitely recommend Mister Balloon if anyone does a party or an event in Vegas!
They're also really affordable.
We called other balloon companies and their balloons cost well over $1400.
We got it for half that price with Mister Balloon!

John was fantastic!
I called from California to have a balloon bouquet delivered to a casino for my granddaughter's 21st birthday.
He was so helpful and friendly that I knew I had the perfect person to fulfill this birthday request.
Yay!

I would highly recommend Mr.
Balloon for party\event decorating in Las Vegas.
My sisters only wish for her wedding reception was that she have balloons so I called around to many different places.
Jon was more than helpful with all my questions and he really worked with me on the payment options.
He sent me a text after he delivered the balloons which I thought was a really cool thing for him to do.
His prices were really reasonable even for my cheap budget.
The balloon arrangements were just perfect and my sister was so thrilled to have her balloons at her reception.
should I ever need another balloon delivery in the area I will certainly use Mr.
Balloon again!
Thanks Jon :o)
