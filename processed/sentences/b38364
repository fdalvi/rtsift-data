Very friendly lady that works there.
Good clean place.

While traveling and staying at Sam's Town hotel and casino, I found this clean and nice laundromat.
Prior to this,  I have been extremely reluctant or hesitant about using any laundromat for general public  but I decided to give it a try after talking to the owner on the phone.
The machines are modern and clean, and the place looks clean and safe.
Free WIFI is a wonderful addition.
If I am in Las Vegas and have a load of wash,  I will come here.
I will highly recommend this place to all my friends who do not have washer/dryer at home.

Despite the name, you can't use coins here.
Everything is operated with a special cash card you must buy on site and you can only pay for with bills.
No coins, no debit or credit cards, just bills.
If I had actually been able to use any of the machines I might have been able to leave a better review.
The place is very clean and attended with machines that appear to be very well maintained.
