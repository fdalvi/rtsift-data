Oh jeez I hate it when spring roles around and the drive through starts to smell...
If you go to the drive through, be ready to keep your windows up because the grease box in the back STINKS... ugh - going through in a convertible to satisfy my oreo blizzard jones was enough to ruin my appetite.
Service is OK except in two cases, which unfortunately happen often: 1) a crowd of people inside; or 2) some in front at the drive through ordering multiple items.
To be fair, all the ice cream items (why order anything else at DQ?
) are fine, as good as any other DQ.
But the outside stench at the drive through and slow service limit me to only two stars.

Peanut.
Buster.
Parfait.
The.
End.

They have closed this location.
To bad because I'll miss it.
The parking was terrible but I dealt with it since I hate drive throughs.
