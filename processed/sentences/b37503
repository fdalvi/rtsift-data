Been here on a couple occasions, wife works not to far from here.
I'll stop off and get her lunch!
How nice of me!!!!
Jack in the Box is alright.
I do love their jalapeno poppers!
Wife loves their tacos!!!
Which I do to, I DON'T CARE IF IT CONTAINS MOSTLY OF SOY!!!!
Daughter likes their teriyaki chicken bowl!
Service is like most other fast food joints.
Overall it's not a bad place to visit, you get what you want!

Stopped in here early Sunday morning on my way to work.
It made me remember why I avoid fast food.
Went through the drive-thru, paid for my food, got my food, and the guy said "have a nice day.
"  He never gave me my change.
I didn't say anything because it was only 20 cents, but I'll never return and I don't encourage anyone else to eat here.

Slowest place ever!!!
It should not take over 10 min to get my food!!!!
Ridiculous!!!!!
I am never coming here again!!!
