This place is Supercuts meets ESPN Zone, minus the bar.
If you're looking for a true barber shop with Razor cuts and fades, this isn't it.
There's cute girls working here and you're paying mostly for that.

Horrible haircut.
The lady did not want to hear how I wanted my hair cut.
She kept saying that it wouldn't work.
And she didn't even know how to do a taper.
Just awful.
Not to mention that the TVs weren't working.

This was like a hair spa for men!
I got great tapered haircut, while watching a game, a double head massage and a back massage while getting 20% military discount.
Maria was my barber, she was funny, skilled with the clippers and easy to talk to.
I not only got a good haircut but felt relaxed and stress-free after my visit.
I'm definitely coming back.
PS.
I hardly ever write reviews, but this place was worth it.
