I absolutely love their Italian Sandwich and their huge 28" pizzas never cease to amaze me.
You can barely fit the pizza through the doorway!
They just opened recently, so I'm anxious to try other menu items.

I have been to a lot of places during my travels and this place blows me away with value and atmosphere.
The restaurant has an amazing "Top Gun" atmosphere with its cool jet fighter vibe combined with a lot of humor.
But the real reason you go is the food and service and it is truly top notch.
If you are with the family or with a big group of guys you have got to order the 28" pizza.
It is like an aircraft carrier in size and tasty to boot.
My wife loves the wings and the sandwiches which always satisfy.
If you are looking for a great place to have lunch or a nice dinner you gotta go to Saguaro.
Great place to go before the game and for sure I am ordering their 28incher for the SUPER BOWL.

So im split on this place, on one hand their sandwiches are so yummy but on the other hand I am not such a fan of the pizza, I think its the dough or sauce im not quite sure, but my husband loves the pizza so that just shows you that we never agree on anything having to do with food!
the gyro is delish and my favorite sammies are the turkey and the steak and provolone ,the crusty french bread they put them on is amazing!
since its right next to Luke AFB you usually get alot of hungry airmen at lunch time,maybe even see my hubby!, but hey who doesnt want to take a peek at some handsome men in uniform?
lol a delish sammy and some eye candy for dessert!

Closed now it's Filiberto's
