No idea if they did the taxes correctly or not, but I can tell you once they get your files for the year you will be stuck using them, because then it will be too late to change.
Here's how they work: if you have a question you can phone them many times and they will never pick up, so you politely leave messages either with their helper or on their service.
Do not expect them ever to respond.
And then you get desperate and email them a polite short email with the question maybe 3-4 times.
Again, do not expect a response as you will not get one.
If the above scenario is the way you like being treated then go to Beck Tax Works.
If not, go elsewhere.
I like being treated professionally and with a modicum of respect.
I'm going elsewhere.

Luck T is very correct.
In the process of buying a house the underwriter had a question regarding the one tax filing I did with Beck.
Tried calling and leaving a message and emailing... No response... Any one who goes through the house buying process knows about the deadlines and urgency for clarifications.
No help from Beck we found the answer elsewhere.
Never will use Beck again!!

I don't know why the other reviewers had so much trouble.
I find both Becks to be professional, polite, prompt, and proper in every way.
