Making a desk?
A kitchen cabinet?
A yacht out of red oak?
You get the point.
This place has most if not all of what you want.
The guys are helpful once you get them started by asking questions.
If veneer is your thing then it's a great place to go, they have tons of different kinds in rolls that you can look at and they sell craft wood for those certain of their skills.
For all things woodworking check this place out.
It might have moved, be sure to double check the address.

I only give them a one star because there is no option for ZERO stars.
Arrogant, unhelpful, and RUDE.
Telling me "No no no" before they even can see what I have in my hand & am asking for.
They advertise over 600 cabinet hinges, and even show the one I need in the pictures on the bins, but I'm not sure what the measurements mean.
Do I need 3/8 or 1/2?
I don't know, but I have the old hinge with me.
I want to replace ALL the cabinet hinges, not just a single one.
He doesn't even LOOK at what's in my hand & tells me they don't make them anymore.
Ok, seriously?
You haven't even seen what's in my hand!
I see pictures of EXACTLY the same hinge above the bins, can you please help me find the one shown?
Nope.
My cabinet will hang funny if I don't use the old hinges.
Ok, wow.
Went back to Home Depot & bought the new hinges with the ugly finish I didn't like, project done.
Jerks!
