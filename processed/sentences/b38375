The store is actually 3053 W. Aqua Fria to be exact.
Anyhow, I live in this neighborhood and decided to go here for breakfast.
I usually come her about once a week if not more.
It's my last result breakfast, lunch, dinner if I get in a pickle.
I went today to see yet another new set of staff.
This particular location goes through staff like nobody's business!
The shift lead Angel, took my order, which was a ham,egg & cheese sandwich.
The menu states it is $2.50 yet he charged me for a Western Egg sandwich making my total for just the sandwich $3.79.
I don't mind paying for my food, but being overcharged for something that I didn't order is just downright stupid.

Make sure you ask about the coupons before you order.
I ordered a footlong specality sandwich and the cashier told me that my coupon was not eligble.
The sandwich artist asked if I wanted some avacado on my sandwich without telling me this would be an extra charge.
Long story short, I ended up paying almost $10 for a footlong sandwich.
I will use the coupon next time but I will never visit this place again.

I eat here at least once a month.
Typical Subway, no weaknesses- it is what it is- a Subway.
Always clean and a nice welcome upon entering.
Good ice tea selection

Pretty strange to be told by an employee making a sandwich that he would be fired if he added any more pickles!
