It is every girl's worst nightmare...finding a new hairstylist.
I have been faced with this daunting task for a couple of months now.
After asking for peer references, I was referred to Ally at Saskia.
I quickly made an appointment and am so glad I did!
The salon itself has only been open for a short time.
The decor is comforting, the ambiance relaxing and all staff members are very friendly.
At the risk of sounding dated, I have learned that a business that provides good customer service is certainly one worth returning to.
I was also appreciative of the Audrey Hepburn movies playing in the back room :)  Ally was a delight and obviously very good at what she does.
After doing a quick initial meeting, we got to work on fixing my starved-for-attention hair.
I have very thick and finicky hair--this seemed to be no problem for my new fabulous stylist.
After my partial highlight and cut, I happily paid my bill knowing that it was well worth the services rendered.
Looking forward to my next appointment at this up and coming salon!

I have been going to Saskia as a hair dresser for over 7 years.
I was so excited to see her new salon.
It's so nice inside.
The decor is like Z Gallerie meets Cosmo Magazine.
I go to Saskia for full blonde highlights, haircuts and brow waxing.
She is amazing.
The salon offers complimentary coffee (bonus) and plays good music.
I love the art gallery in the back.
It rotates often, featuring all local artists.
In my opinion, Saskia Salon provides great service at a chic, easy-to-find location.

There is no way I can go back to one of those cost cutter/great clips places after coming to Saskia.
After the first color/ cut I saw my hair for more than hair.
She works with your style and helps you get creative with your hair.
Red is not an easy color and since I've been going here I get non-stop complements on my color and style.
I would highly recommend

Even my husband commented on how much he liked my hair and he NEVER DOES THAT!
Do you need a new stylist?
Run, don't walk, to see Ally!
She truly performed a miracle on me.
Great color and highlights and such a easy cut it practically styles itself.
Salon is in a great location.
Easy to get to and find.
Tons of parking too.
Very clean, well kept and stylish.
Great front desk gal too.
This salon has that high end feel without horrible high end prices.
Treat yourself and come out feeling like a new person!

Best experience ever!
Love the salon, friendly staff, very comfortable and cozy.
Blair was great!
She did a beautiful job, I love my hair cut!
I will be back when I need my hair cut again.

I have been going to Saskia for 9 years.
She does the best color on the planet hands down, and her pricing is really reasonable.
I went to over a dozen different high end hairstylists before I found her.
The color never fades for me, and she always gets it all the way to the root.
It is always perfect.
Blair is also awesome if Saskia is booked.
Saskia also did my wedding hair, and I have sent every friend I could over to her.
They are amazing, and it is a really fun environment.
I can also tell you that they are all extremely nice people that work there.

Saskia Salon is still my go-to for almost 3 years now.
In the time I have been a client, I have gone through multiple (and radical) style/color changes, enjoyed my sister's wedding day with a BEAUTIFUL do and also learned how to manage my crazy hair.
Ally is a true talent in her industry.
It has been lovely getting to know Saskia, the other stylists and staff.
I trust them completely with my hair and also enjoy a mani/pedi with Ally when my color is setting.
Saskia Salon, you complete me :)

My godsister introduced me to this wonderfully talented to woman years ago and I must say she is truly an inspiration.
Let me get the obvious part out of the way:  Saskia and her entire team are among best in the business.
Saskia's career is rooted in high end salon experience.
She, and now her team of glamazons, are the only ones I trust with my blonde hair.
The entire staff at Saskia Salon are always on their A game.
They just get it.
The gals and Corey are always looking their best.
They are always upbeat and full of energy - because they know they are a part of something special.
While I hate to share my secret about this wonderful salon, it would be an injustice not to give this talented team the recognition they deserve.
