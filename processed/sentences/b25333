Fantastic Find!
I had heard good things about Mirage, but had avoided the place, leery of the noisy bar-scene aspect!
However, we tried it yesterday & were pleasantly surprised.
The staff was very friendly, the place is squeaky-clean, and the menu was extensive.
Also offered several varieties of beer on tap.
We chose sandwiches, the Philly Chicken Cheesesteak was recommended.
A great choice!
Such a unique flavor, very tasty!!
It was huge, stuffed with grilled onions & peppers.
Loved it!
My partner had the Western BBQ Cheeseburger & it was the best burger ever-big & juicy!
The fries were good & plentiful, next time we'll get 1/2 orders.
What a pleasant surprise!
We're looking forward to trying their breakfasts next!
My only negative was dining next to the bar & free popcorn machine!
The constant stream to the popcorn machine was tiresome, I didn't see a separate dining area.
Simply moving the distracting popcorn location would be an improvement.
Thankfully, the quality of the food & the friendly staff will keep us coming back!
So nice to have a quality place in AJ-yum!

Had breakfast today at The Mirage.
Wisconsin Beer Pancakes.
2 of these over the plate hanging delicious pancakes for only 3.99.
The waitress gives you s::: when you order 2 because she can't quite believe you can eat 2 of these.
But I showed her it was no problem and had an order of Bacon (4 yummy slices) to go with it.
We will  keep this as our high carb breakfast stop for sure!!!
Service was great and the wait staff is friendly and outgoing.

Stopped here to kill some time after work one day.
Always see it but never stopped in.
Plus it's snowbird season and I'm not QUITE ready for my aarp card yet.
Super clean, bright, a few TVs playing different games.
Waitress seemed a little preoccupied even though it wasn't that busy.
I didnt eat, she never stopped long enough for me to order anything.
I'll have to go back sometime and try the food though.
