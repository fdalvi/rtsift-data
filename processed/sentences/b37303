Banana cupcake (no nuts) the cupcake was so moist!
I wish I lived in vegas, I'd definitely go back!
My boyfriend got the strawberry cupcake, it was decent but the banana cupcake was delicious!

Delicious cupcakes for such a good price!
The truck also offers tasty refreshments.
Great service as well.
Wish I could find a way to track them down online...
Anyone know if they have Twitter or Facebook?

I found Cheryl on Yelp of course because I wanted cupcakes for my wedding; and frankly all the other bakeries here in town just pile on the frosting which i think masks the flavor.
She came out to meet with me and I  tasted many flavors.
I fell in love and placed my wedding order The cupcakes are so moist and perfect.
My guests  and husband loved them all  Will definitely use her again and again.
Thank you Cheryl for making my wedding perfect.
