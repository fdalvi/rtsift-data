It was SO cold today!
So here I was, chillin' like ice in my cube pretending to be hard at work when it struck me.
While my salad in the fridge might be the healthy choice, I was freaking COLD and there was no way I was eating more coldness.
I wanted warm comfort food.
But without the sit down comfort food prices.
Chili.
Wendy's has Chili.
For less than $3 and in less than 10 minutes round trip, I had a big thing of chili, an order of chicken nuggets and I was headed back to the office.
Broke up the crackers, stirred into the chili.
Mmmmm... heaven.
You can get it with extra onions and/or w/ cheese on top.
Small 99cents, large is like $1.75.
Yea, Wendy's is good for your standard drive through burger stuff too, and I happen to love the heck out of their dollar menu, but nothing beats Chili in the drive through on a cold day!

Wendy's gets knocked from time to time for rocking square beef patties and flaunting their salads and soups as "healthy.
" Though I can't really speak to the soups or salads, I'll tell you what I can speak to: frosties.
Eat a burger, fries and a frosty and tell me you're not satisfied afterwards.
Because you'll be lying through your teeth.
Wendy's is cheap, fast, and if you don't like it, well I guess I just don't believe you.

This Wendy's drive through is open late.
Like most Wendy's the food is tasty, cheap, and comes out quick.
Not much else to say, it is a Wendy's...

Love Wendy's new salads and burgers.
This was my first visit to this particular location and I found it to be very clean.
I felt bad for the guy running the cash register because no one was helping him but he was very polite.
