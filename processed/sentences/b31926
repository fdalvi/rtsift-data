I placed an order two months ago.
They took my money and I never heard from them.
Have tried e-mailing - no response,  Tried calling - phone disconnected.
They must have gone out of business right around the time they took my order,  Website still up and running but I advise not placing any orders with them.
Gave them one star because I had to put something  Ok a few hours after posting the above review, I received two emails that the canvas was unavailable and they were refunding my money.
Does not explain not responding to my follow up emails or disconnected telephone #.
That's all I know about this store.
They said they called me several times but calls do not show on my phone .
