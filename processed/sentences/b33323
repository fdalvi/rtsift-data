Super cute bohemian style!
Shopped for my 14 year old niece here.
Very cute, unique stuff, some of it for older than 14.
Decent prices for Town Square, though!

Found this boutique while browsing through a local magazine.
Its fairly new at Town Square and a short walk from Whole Foods.
I was warmly greeted and helped by the staff, but they didn't hover.
Items were very nicely priced...too nice to not buy.
Great items- classy and trendy.
Def on par for girls like me in their 20s.
PS.
They sent me a coupon/thank you note after visiting, HANDWRITTEN!

Petite , overload with latest trends prices great love it

I've never heard of this boutique before.
I found it while walking to whole foods.
They said they've been there for over 2 years!
Kind of a shock but I'm never on that side of the mall so it totally makes sense.
Bohme would probably be my new favorite clothing store if it wasn't so pricey.
I was lured in by a sign outside that was advertising their promo - buy 2 and get the 3rd item half off.
They have super cute displays around the store.
I looked around for a bit and the girls there are friendly too.
I had a few items in my hand and they offered to start a fitting room for me.
When I was ready, she told me she added a few extra items for me to try on along with the stuff I had originally picked.
I thought that was awesome but I was on a budget and couldn't allow myself to spend more than I had already anticipated.
I ended up walking out of the store with two dresses and a blouse for $112.
Not too bad but it is on the pricey side because I feel like the clothing is comparable to a higher end hottie or even forever 21.
I'll be coming here again because I think it's a cute store and the sales associates were amazing.
They made the whole shopping experience wonderful,  suggesting certain styles and telling me about new trends without being over bearing like most other places.
