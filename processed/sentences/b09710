Great bunch of people...I've gone there for years.
Just got a call from CVS they are taking over their prescriptions!
What??
What happened to them?
Why did they close?
I'm NOT happy!

I heard CVS bought them out.Being across the street from CVS was maybe to much competition for that store.Also it changed hands a few times prior to the sale.....Again,this is just what I heard at my pharmacy...I went to Tatum drugs twice,both times my prescription was incorrect.Although I have heard CVS has the same problem at their Tatum/Dynamite location.Update 3/8/13: I just went over to the UPS store and walked by the Pharmacy,Its open,under a new name..Infinity I think it was,but it is open.
