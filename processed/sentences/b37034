This is an excellent little shop for shipping, printing, notary services, document shredding, and so on.
It is a small independent business, and the staff is very polite and helpful.
You can ship FedEx, UPS, USPS, etc.
They will help with packaging, and will direct you to the best and most economical way to ship your things.
At least twice I've walked in thinking I wanted to ship something UPS, but they pointed out to me that a different method would be cheaper.
Please note that there IS a surcharge for shipping here.
This is how they make money, so don't be surprised.
Just ask what the surcharge is for various things so you're not surprised.
If you ask them to box something up for you, or repackage something, or add extra services, there are going to be charges.
They are straightforward about them--just ask.
It might cost you $7 to ship something Priority Mail down the street at the post office, but you'll have to wait in line for an hour and deal with surly USPS employees.
At Mailboxes & More, it might cost you $8 or $9, but you're paying for convenience.

Wait is usually long, and owner is sometimes friendly but sometimes indifferent.

This is a cool little shipping store.
It's kinda cluttered with tons of shipping supplies, lots of mail supplies, but everything you might need.
I like it!
