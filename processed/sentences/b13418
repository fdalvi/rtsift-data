This subway is inside a plaza next to an Ice Cream Shoppe, A Dennys, a JC Penny, and some eyeglass store.
There's a couple seats outside and more inside the little area it holds.
I've gone here many times for both lunch and dinner and the staff is always friendly, though it can get a bit busy depending on what time of day you go.
Since the food is prepared right in front of you, its rare that anything has gone wrong, I've been going here for a few years now off and on.
I should note that the soda fountain is a bit squished in so its a little difficult to put a lid on your drink, and the facility itself closes kind of early, I think 9:00?
but other then that a great place to get a bite to eat.

Very, very dirty.
Fans and drink cooler have caked on dirt.
So gross...  Won't be back here again.

Brought in a coupon for a free 6" sub with the purchase of one of equal or greater value.
I decided to get a footlong for me and the six inch for my son.
I feel totally ripped off.
They said in order to use the coupon they would have to ring it in as 3 separate six inch subs because the computer wouldn't recognize the coupon with a footlong.
So in the end I ended up paying more for the 2 six inch sandwiches than I would have if I had just paid for my footlong and a six inch.
Totally bugged!
