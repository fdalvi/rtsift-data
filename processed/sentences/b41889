couldn't be happier with new ownership and excellent service.
Had all of my girls nails done here and they're just perfect

Love Lish nails!
The staff and owners are so nice.
My mom and I come here every other weekend because we genuinely like it.
I have never been to a nail salon so clean.
They open up a new package of tools every visit and use a new liner for the tub with every pedi.
The owners Levi and Thao always make sure the customers are happy and have water lol.
One time me and my mom were waiting a while and Levi offered us a coupon for a complimentary ice cream from Baskin Robbins :)

Lish nails is the best!
Clean, professional, super nice and truly care!
Every technician is great, I've been to them all!
The new management is awesome as well !
Prices are average but the quality of work is amazing!
Huge selection of colors, especially gel/shellac colors!
:) pedicure chairs are really nice and they use a new liner in the tub every time - yay for being super clean :)
