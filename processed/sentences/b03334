I love Lucky Brand.
They have this one type of jeans that make my butt look so good, but you won't find me at this store very often.
Why?
Because Lucky Brand is expensive!
And this store is all about full price!
Your better off finding great deals on Lucky Jeans or other clothing from Lucky on sale elsewhere.
Places like Nordstroms or Nordstrom Rack and Department Stores Sales.
Gotta love their four leaf clover branding image and the way the inside zippers all say "lucky you"!
Hmm!

Me and my bf shop here every couple of months to get him new jeans, and this one guy helped us, let us take our time and just very nice.
I went back 3 months later and i walked in the store and he remembered my name!
Like wow, 3 months ago i was in there shopping, for him to not only remember me but my name!
That is GREAT service.
The only bad thing is the manger ( I think she is) she is a total bitch,and if your not going to buy something right away your wasting her time.
Even though this lady is a bitch.
The other employees are so nice, and so friendly i still rate them 5 stars :)

This is a great Lucky Store location - always a good selection, friendly staff and never a shortage of dressing rooms.
Lucky is my favorite brand of jeans.
They're expensive but far less so than most other high-end, long-lasting brands of jeans.
I can always find something flattering and every single pair I've owned has lasted forever.
I've worn only Lucky jeans for almost three years and nothing has even begun to wear out yet.
Their tee-shirts are really cute and long-lasting as well (depending on the material), and my favorite belt came from their bargain bin - always worth a look for incredible buys!
They have great sales often, so get on the mailing list.

I haven't visited this store until today.
So...I was walking across Scottsdale Rd and I see a really pretty girl and loved her top.
We started talking and I asked where she got it and so there I was going into LB.
They didn't have the top and I had to go to the Fashion Square location.
But, Megan and Ingrid were totally helpful and I did find some awesome stuff.
The jewelry is so fine.
Thanks!
Good Job!
Now I'm a fan!
