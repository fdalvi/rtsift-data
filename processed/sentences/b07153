This was a true value for 25 bones on fathers day.
Very tough and well thought out course with a good mix of everything including old pokes in front of you making the experience last all day.
I shot a 90 (18 over on this par 72) and had a blast with my dad and talking to the guys who work there.
Good ambiance, great golf, 4 sets of tees to play off of like a championship course.
Not a ton of tight holes where you can hit it 3 blocks over with a slice.
Check it out before it gets too hot, wait...

First, the staff was wonderful.
However, the course was horrible.
We heard that it was recently purchased, and the owner is going through an improvement period.
That doesn't change the fact that were was standing water throughout; the greens were terrible (back nine better than the front); the tee boxes were 35% weeds and the fairways ... well, it wasn't good.
It's an $18 round at best.
Give it another year and hopefully it will improve.

Pretty rough shape and ugly to boot.
Most muni courses better than this one.
Lots of dirt - ugly.
Fairways clumpy,  Course is boring.
One water hole.
Zero doglegs.
Minimal bunkers.
Can't think of a reason to play this again or recommend it to anyone.

Decent course for being in the middle of a neighborhood in phx.
Not very friendly mngt.
Did not feel welcomed in the slightest bit.
Nor was he helpful.
I returned the cart after 9 holes and he told me to drop it off in the correct area.
Very poor customer service.
The whole time, there were no other ppl around.
I was treated like an annoyance.
I dont want special service or treatment but i know when im not welcome.
Side note- the marshall was present, courteous & helpful.
The greens were clean.
Fairways were nice, not perfect but good.
For all the other options in phx, i wont be returning here.
