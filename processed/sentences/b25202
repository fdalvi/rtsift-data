My girlfriend and I walked into Isaac Jewelers to look at rings today.
There were 3 employees on the floor and one of them was with a customer.
We slowly walked around the display for at least 5 minutes (obviously looking for engagement rings).
They did not say hello to us or even acknowledge our existence.
The bad news for them is that they lost out on my business.
We like Betteridge or Ganem thus far.
They have great choices and are super friendly.
There are too many quality choices in Scottsdale for this kind of poor behavior.

My wife and I have been visiting this location for a few years now.
Every one of the Staff have always been very welcoming and friendly when we come by.
Regardless if we are window shopping, or making a purchase, the staff is always available to answer our questions.

I have been twice--- The family business was warm and inviting.
I had two pieces of jewelry to be repaired and they did it with a smile.
I am not in the market for big jewelry items but as soon as I need something I will be running right up to them!!
Thanks for the smiles and the help.
They have beautiful items... Ladies :)
