Gone are the days of the 24/7 Kinkos... but with the FedEx merge, this is a consistent one-stop-shop for your business needs!
Every now and then I have to copy, fax, print, or create something that is above and beyond the realm of what I can do in my home-office... and luckily, this FedEx Kinko's is right around the corner and comes to the rescue.
(It seems there is a FedEx Kinko's around the corner from everyone now-a-day... kind of like Starbuck's - well, not quite!
)   I happened to stop in twice today and Ryan took care of me both times.
He was friendly and patient during both my visits.
5 stars for Ryan; 3 for consistency on this one-stop shop... if only they weren't so expensive!

Super helpful!!!
He came out to my car got the packages, carried them in, taped them up and everything!
They were friendly and helpful which he did not have to be since there were 5 other customers in there at the same time.
But he was great at multitasking and helping everyone at once.

This FedEx Office is what I like to call an "Outpost Store"  they are away from any central business district and as a result they think they can scale back and half-ass everything they do.
Example: They don't open until 10 on Saturday.
When I have to work from home, especially on a Saturday, I like to get up get it going and get it over with.
Speaking of getting it going - I need to get going to find a REAL business center to do my copying, collating, stapling and faxing.

Rude!
The man working here today had no interest in my business.
I simply wanted to ship some documents, but instead of outlining options or helping me he just pointed at a display of envelopes and said I had to buy those first.
When I grabbed a single express envelope he just said I couldn't use that instead of explaining that I could use that to ship express.
When I said i would go to a UPS store instead he just said "yeah" and walked away.
Horrible customer service- I won't be back to this location!
