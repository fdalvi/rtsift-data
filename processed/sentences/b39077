They have everything here!

I know this is going to be a silly review but if you love hot, soft pretzels then you MUST have one from here.
They are sooooooooooooooooo good!
They are big, soft, buttery and delicious.
I had no idea I could get such a delicious pretzel at a gas station.
So, go try one so you can see why I am so adamant about them.

Regular Gas $2.99.

Love this one too.
Clean, New, Friendly staff.
Great Tea.
No place for us to park the 18 Wheeler though, so I walked over.
And I was happy to see a QT and not a Truck Stop.
I felt like I was back home in Atlanta!

Clean facility, inside and out.
Fresh products.
Cheap fountain soda.
Great customer service too!

They finally have a store in Buckeye.
Very large and clean store.
The staff are friendly and the area that it is in is heavily patrolled by Buckeye PD, MCSO, and DPS.
This is probably one of the safest gas stops heading out west towards the California border.
I hope they build a QT in Quartzsite.
That would be really nice.

This may be the craziest review I've ever written but this is THE GREATEST GAS STATION IVE EVER BEEN TO.
Cleanest nicest, biggest bathrooms.
Employees were extremely attentive.
Every beverage known to man is sold here including legitimately 30 slushy flavors and alcohol.
Every snack and candy is sold here.
Gas pumps galore.
Everything was amazingly clean and ready to go!!!
Favorite gas station ever.
Quiktrip I applaud you.
