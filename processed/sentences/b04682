This is the place to go for any battery!
They have saved my life and my phones!
Thank you for the awesome service!

Oh yea... checked out the flashlight that cost 260.00.
Um needs batteries.
Not as bright as the sun.
So I will not be purchasing it.
Called to see if they had a certain battery the guy says yes come down Will be ready.
So I picked it up and it was wrong one then I took it back.
Got money back he tried to give me another one I said no it should have been right the first time.
Well I am ok with it I guess.
Can't expect every thing to be perfect.
Over all these people are nice.
Refund was easy.
I must be tired right now because I am not bothered by this.

On the bright side, they had the motorcycle battery I needed in stock.
As for the rest - the battery was way overpriced, they offer a military discount but you have to be active duty - can't be retired, reserve, etc., and the battery that was supposed to come fully charged was not - had to get it charged before it would even start my bike.
Not a fan ...
