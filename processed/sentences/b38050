Large Selection of Used Tires & Cheap Auto Repair

Brought my chevy astro van for a tune up and some repairs.
Cost me much cheaper than i thought.
Everyting was done in just a couple hours.
They got professional equipment to diagnose the problem too.
Also recommender this shop to my friend who also does HVAC and doesn't have too much free time.
He had his breaks done and tune up (including oil change) in 2 hours as promised.
Great service, good techs.

here I thought my days in a tire shop between new installations were behind me.
New England Winters have cost me 2 different tires after falling into brutal pot holes in my time there.
Moving to vegas I figured the roads have no freezing to deal with so no problems right?
nope.
Construction in the building next to mine I imagine is to blame for a nail finding it's way in my tire this morning.
These guys did a good job fixing it.
3 stars cause i feel like he pushed me a little hard to buy a new set of four.
When I need new ones, I'll take advantage of their wanting to sell me then.

This place would get ten stars if the option was available.
Honest and great service.
I walked in needing a single tire and the owner walked me around and took care of me and gave me exactly what I was looking for.
