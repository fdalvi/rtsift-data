We hired Fancy Faces for the kids at our company picnic.
It was fabulous!
We will have her back for all our future events entertainment.
A good time had by all!

What a great face painter!
My son's birthday party was Pirate themed, and not only did she do great pirate makeup, but princesses too.
Ann was very professional, arrived early, set up and worked nonstop till the kids were all happy.
Everyone commented on how much fun the party was because of Fancy Faces!
I will definitely use them again!

Ann really knows how to make a party fun!
I was attending a party while I was in Vegas and the kids had so much fun getting their faces painted.
She really knows how to work with kids.
I would have gotten tired, but Ann seems to LOVE what she does and it shows.
