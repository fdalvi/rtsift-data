Hands down one of the best family-owned and operated nail salons I've ever been to & I've been to nail school.
They are so nice & very accomodating.
Not to mention the work they do, definitely outstanding & their prices are so inexpensive for the quality of work.
Very clean, pleasing ambiance.
I love this place and come about every two weeks.
Definitely RECOMMEND!
:D Reservations are suggested.

I still love this place so much!
GO!!!

I love Glossy nails.
Great customer service :)
