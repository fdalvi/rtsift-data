Service counter clerks are very friendly and helpful.

I love this store!
Everyone is super helpful and nice.
They have the best products.
The paint is high quality and I love that they carry metallic paint, hardly anyone carries it any more and most of our client love metallic finishes!

This is my first time actually purchasing the paint with Dunn-Edwards.
I have heard about this place through the painters that repainted our house few years ago that they purchased the paints through them.
If you do live in a Homeowner Association home(s), just provide your association name to them and most likely you will get some soft of a discounts on all the purchases.
Good luck!

Was immediately helped when I walked in.
Had my paint ready in 10 minutes.
Got a discount for being in an HOA.
Satisfied customer.

Over 200$ for a 5gallon bucket of exterior flat paint ?
I DO NOT think so.
Sorry.
Last three times there my colors were off tint.
Had to return with poor service.
I'll shop Frazee now.
Sorry.
Dunn.

These guys make it very clear they don't like working with home owners.
Short answers with an attitude is a typical Dunn Edwards response.
Frazee is right down the road and they are fine working with contractors or home owners.
