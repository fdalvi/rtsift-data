Tex's has by far the best burger in Waterloo/Kitchener.
I have tried burgers from all over the city and so far i have not found anything quite as good as Tex's.
All the burger meat is ground/seasoned in house and they use fresh buns and quality ingredients.
Their garlic mayonnaise which comes standard on every burger is also amazing.
You can order pretty much any burger on the menu and never be disappointed.
I haven't ventured too far into their other menu items, however they do offer other things like ribs, and chicken which I can only assume would be amazing.
I have tried the wings however and i can say they are GOOD, but i wish they would provide more options for flavour as right now they just use standard BBQ sauce (some Franks would be nice).
Overall, great food, great atmosphere, super friendly staff.

Good lunch spot offering burgers and sandwiches.
I tried the pulled chicken sandwich with fried and it was tasty.
Served on a fresh roll with cole slaw and BBQ sauce, it really hit the spot.
The generous portion of fries was a nice surprise.
Reading the menu they only use fresh and primarily local ingredients and it shows in the food.
I'll be returning next time I'm in town.

Came here on a quiet day.
The staff were friendly.
Menu prices are expensive!
That being said, there are pretty generous portions to the food here and they claim that the beef and potatoes are sourced from Canada.
The food was good, though the size of the burger made it hard to eat without losing some sauce and toppings.
The bun itself is sort of like an elongated hamburger bun in a pseudo hotdog/hamburger-size.
I was not impressed at all with the 'mac and cheese'.
It's made with penne and what I think is Alfredo sauce mixed in with 2 small handfuls of cheese.
It tasted like .... cheesy Alfredo penne and I wasn't really impressed with this side dish.
I'd come here again, but it's not on my list of top Waterloo places to eat out at.

I had the veggie burger (soy, not vegetable patty) with cheddar cheese and it was excellent.
They use more of a dinner roll as a bun, which is a nice change.
They have an excellent in house garlic mayo.
The fries are also wicked!
They are actual potatoes (not potatoes pressed into strings).
Burger, fries and a pop was only $10.
