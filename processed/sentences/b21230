I love this bar.
Regardless of the time of day, R and I seem to wind up here directly after we leave Edinburgh airport.
There is no better way to celebrate your arrival in Edinburgh than with an icy cold Tennants (in my opinion).
We find ourselves in Winston's quite often during our visits to Edinburgh.
It's very convenient to where we stay while we're in town.
It's got a lot of little quirks that I really love.
Whenever we go, we always see the same group of men standing around the high table in the middle of the seating area.
I love how people bring their dogs in and just let them roam among the patrons.
It's an old school kind of place.
There's no loud music (although I've seen it get fairly crowded in the evenings) and during the day, it's bright and sunny (if there's sun).
It reminds me of the type of place you'd find your grandpa at, watching the game with his buddies.

Winston's regularly has Deuchars IPA plus 2-3 of Caledonian's guest beers, and deserves its spot in the Good Beer Guide.
It also has a good selection of malts, a friendly atmosphere, and is my usual place to visit in Corstorphine.

Good, local pub serving a small selection of real ales as well as regular lagers etc.
Not a bad venue for watching sports on the tv and the staff are friendly.

Toller kleiner Pub, total authentisch, ca.
10 verschiedene Biere und 60(!!
) verschiedene Whiskey Sorten!
Das Personal war super nett.
Toll, alles richtig gemacht!
