The owner is friendly, helpful, and kind.
This is a Mom and Pop place, and not all glitchy and glitzy like the big corporate chain stores.
I enjoyed my visit here, and bought my birdy a toy that she loves at a price a bit cheaper than the corporate stores sell it for.

This shop sells electronics and birds.
It is woefully depressing in there.
I feel sorry for the birds.
The guy needs to not be in the bird business.
If you want to see a great bird shop in he area go to Tropic Zone.

This is a great place.
The owner is super friendly.
The birds are amazing.
He boarded for me and my bird came back in a great mood!

The owner is very kind and knowledgeable.
The feed is far better than what you would find at a large retail store.
You can tell the birds are well cared for.
A much better option than having someone that knows nothing about birds watching my baby.
