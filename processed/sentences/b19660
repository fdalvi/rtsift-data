If you like fresh and I mean fresh veggies, this is the place for you.
It is open on Saturdays and not all year round.
But should be opening again soon.
They do not always have the same produce each week since they pick what is growing at the given moment.
But it is always quality and this next bit is from his web site.
"Growing everything myself, the produce sold at my farm stand is chemical-free and better than organic.
I use NO pesticides of any kind, NO insecticides, ZERO antibiotics, NO chemical fertilizers, and absolutely NO genetically modified organisms.
Certain sprays and soaps are allowed in organic farming, but at Tonopah Rob's Vegetable Farm I practice an all-natural method using beneficial bug warfare, green compost, natural fertilizers, and companion planting as my strategy and line of defense.
"  Speaking of web sites go and follow the instructions on how to get there On-line maps do not lead you in the right direction.
You can also sign up for email updates as to what will be sold that week.
This place is actually in Tonopah, the far west valley.
I put Phoenix so it would show up here.

My husband met Tonapah Rob at the central phx famer's market back a year or 2 ago and we have been out to his farm.
He has wonderful veggies!
He will ship to you also.
Check him out:-)

The people are so helpful and friendly.
Tonopah Rob really enjoys what he does.
He is always happy to share ideas on how to prepare the vegetables.
But he seems to cater to more then mores.

Tonopah Rob's is the real deal.
It is better quality than what you are going to find in the organic grocery section at the store.

Wow this place has changed.
Tonopah Rob might want to take a bite of some humble pie and worry about what his own farm is doing.
I am done with the smugness that has over taken this place.
