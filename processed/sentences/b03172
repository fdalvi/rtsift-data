I like the staff at the Walgreens pharmacy, they're helpful and are usually friendly.
At times they can be just pleasant but I've got nary a complaint of this location.
Overall the store is neat and organized and I am able to pick up items whenever I'm too lazy to stop by Target.

Yeee hooo, just like every other walgreens on the planet.
If you have been in one before, this one is exactly the same,

Always clean and usually has anything I'm looking for in stock.
Most of the product is way more expensive than Walmart, but it's good for the convenience.
Some of the employees are grumpy, but I overlook it most of the time.

always had positive experiences at this store.
no complaints.

Well all Walgreens are essentially the same.
Pharmacy team is great and fast!

Best place around for the Flu Shot!
Thanks for making my arm sore...
