The nesting phase.
A period of time in which you become more interested in the thread count of sheets than the lastest denim brand to hit the market.
Yes.
I am there.
And I have found my ultimate home store.
Haus has opened a new big airy store in Scottsdale and I absolutely love everything in it.
Dwell and Area linens.
Angela Adams rugs.
Mid-century modern decor.
Ultra hip (and comfortable) furniture.
I don't know enough about home decor to drop many names.
Just take my word for it.
If you like modern design, this is the store for you.

I love Haus!
They have a wonderful array of modern furniture and accessories.
But what I like the most was their display of concave mirrors.
They also have some very nice walnut framed mirror.
I have a friend that likes Jonathan Adler, though I'm not seeing it.
They also have some fun items to sort thru.
Give 'em a shot, you will be visually entertained.
They also have a location in Biltmore, but this store on Scottsdale is bigger.
