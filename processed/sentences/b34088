This place is amazing!
The lighting is spectacular and the walk-in humidor is real treat for any cigar aficionado.
However, what makes this place exceptional is the stellar customer service that you'll receive from the two "Johns" who work here (they are both named John: one is Persian-German and the other is from New York).
These guys are awesome and they treat each customer with care.
Admittedly, it's a bit strange to see another smoke shop facing this one from across the street, but do yourself a favor and stop here instead to be treated like a VIP!
Their selection of potpourri and hookah is abundant, and they always have specials on cigarettes as well.
If you are looking for some nice water pipes or glassware, then you'll find that here, too.
Definitely a must-see.
If you stop by, tell the Johns that L2 says hello!

This smoke shop is a rip off place!
Bought a G5 pen but was given the wrong defective one.
Did not want to give a refund and insist  no return on any purchase on the store even though there no sign about the policy.
The owner took the product and just told me to dispute the charge on my credit card.
Total jerk and asshole!!!

Racist owner.
Actually told me he wasn't worried about a customer because they were black so they can't afford anything they were looking at anyway.
No customer service skills and ridiculously overpriced.
Charging $90 for the k100 mod vape that's normally 60 anywhere else.
With so many smoke shops in town I won't be back.
And if you're the owner and you're  reading this.
You're a douchebag.
Respect your customers or find a new line of work.
