Well this place is wayyyy out of my way to get hair products.
But they have the friendlist people.
There prices are alot lower than other places.
I also like the fact that its easy to get to because it's right off the freeway, if your coming from an area that dosn't have this kind of beauty supply.

One word IVAN!!
I Love the ladies there also.
Yes there are so called cheaper places, however you get hands on service and discounts here.
The store is organized and well stocked.
There are only 2 registers so there will be lines, its worth it when you see your receipt!!
It would take all day to list the items they have, my suggestion GO THERE YOURSELF, SEE FOR YOURSELF!!
You will be pleasantly surprised.
