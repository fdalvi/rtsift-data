I loathe you oh AAS for you tooketh all my finances.
Okay so I gave willingly.
Bad art store....bad.
Awesome for book binding supplies not to mention staff full of knowledge and free tips.
If they don't have the stuff, they get it shipped to their store from other locations in town without cost to me.
Other art materials seem a teensy bit pricey, but they give discounts to artists (and teachers).

I love this place and am grateful that I can take painting lessons from talented artists.
I have learned a lot and most of the supplies are priced very reasonably!

Awesome customer service!
Very helpful.
NEED more art classes!
