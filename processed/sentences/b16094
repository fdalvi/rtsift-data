They did a huge over-hall on my pool electrical system.
Installed state of the art equipment...as well as many other upgrades.
We found them to be professional, on time and honest.
Highly recommend.

After two times out to fix a pool pump leak they were suppose to replace the housing on the third visit.
On the third visit they sent a new employee with no knowledge of the prior visits or problem.
He did not have the housing part and tried to sell me a new pump.
BEWARE.
THEY DO NOT DISCLOSE THE $80 SERVICE CHARGE WHEN U MAKE AN APPOINTMENT.
Bottom line.
3 visits and $347 later I still have my leak.
POOR SERVICE AND CHARGES ARE HIGH.

After an unsuccessful long year with many pool repair companies, we called Rogers Repair Service and they got our pool / spa heater working.
Roger came out and repaired our old pool system and I was very happy with his work.
Will be sticking to Roger's Repair for future repair needs.
