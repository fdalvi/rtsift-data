Lena is the best!
A great cut for around $20.
Got a shoe shine while I waited too!
I've been coming here for over 4 years and would recommended it to anyone.

Lena did a fantastic job, for a price that is better than anywhere else in Scottsdale.
This is definitely where I will be going from now on.
It's hard to find a place to get a quality mens haircut and shave with a straight razor, but Mercado Ranch Barber Shop does it very well.

Everything I expected and a great price.
It was a hair-cut I am happy with and cost under $20.
I will be going back from now on.

Great haircuts.
Good prices.
Highly Recommended.
Cuts hair the way you want it done.

Great haircut, great service and great prices!
Lena has been cutting my hair now for about 8 years and I couldn't be happier.
It is normal to be apprehensive about trying a new barber.
Don't be.
With Lena at Mercado Ranch Barber Shop, your hair will look better than you ever believed possible.
I don't know how she does it.
But she does.
No need to look any further.
This is the best place to get a haircut.
I promise you.

I have been going to Lena for Years!
Most of  the time I make an appointment, as she is very Busy!
She gives a great haircut and style for women.
I have short hair which is hard to cut, but I always leave there with a GREAT look!!

Lena has cut my hair for over 10 years.
She consistently gives me a great cut.
She also offers senior citizen rates .
Make sure you call ahead for an appointment.
