Herb is a Private Investigator and now has expanded his business into being a dealer now.
Small shop but he can order anything you need.
It's upstairs but they have an elevator handy and it's easy to find.

Scottsdale Guns is a relatively new gun shop in the strip mall just north of 90th Street and Via Linda.
Contrary to the other review posted for this place, it's not on the second story -- it's actually located in the same retail space as the spy shop.
Their service is prompt, courteous, and knowledgeable -- everything you'd want in a small firearms shop like this.
I only used them as the destination for an FFL transfer, but they have a surprisingly good selection of pistols, rifles and accessories.
Craig (the guy that runs the place) used to work in the firearms department of a major sporting goods department store and is very well-informed when it comes to firearms and the FFL process.
This aptitude is demonstrated by his attention to detail and his easy-going nature.
Definitely looking forward to using them as my go-to firearms shop in the future.

Id avoid this place at all costs.
Not a friendly work staff!

I'd dropped in here several times to look for guns....their selection is pretty low and their prices are average.
There's a "spy shop" attached to it where you can buy gadgets and other gizmos related to that kind of stuff.
The staff is nice enough, but I probably won't make this place a regular stop unless they get more guns in stock.
