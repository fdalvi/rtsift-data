Just signed up our 2 year old daughter and she loves it :)

This is a great place if you are only looking for a "fun" program to put kids in.
The instruction level is low.
The studio space is very small and kids often go back and forth from the two studio's.
Power was out, floor had problems, music had issues... the list went on.
The competition teams are not great.
If you sign up save your receipts.
I was called by the studio several times claiming I hadn't paid.
I had receipts to show I had.
There is not a lot of transparency.
We were charged $10 for extra rhinestones when none of my kids costumes had rhinestones.
We were charged $45 for hip hop sneakers but the girls were actually given $24 ugg knock off's.
When I confronted the owner about these issues she was rude and said that "it is what it is".
The fundraisers were poorly run and there is no sense of team here.
The location was great for us but after a year of never ending issues, we are going elsewhere.
