Every once in awhile, after work or life has been stressing you out, you've just got to scratch the itch with fast junk food.
This place fit the bill for me tonight.
I ate the Western Bacon Cheeseburger.
It wasn't anything special but it was reasonably priced and they made it quick.
The BBQ sauce was unfortunately bland, but that's probably so it appeals more to the masses.
I now have a hamburger shaped lump in my stomach....and as after any act of mindless passion, I regret my actions.

"Super Nachos" Yeah right, super yucky nachos.
I remember when the nachos were first added to the menu.
They were fresh nacho chips and shreaded cheese with beans and meat.
These were terrible, unless you like baseball nachos.
Stale chips that were bought and canned cheese with old beans.
I mean I am ok with this if it was fresh, but to get the old stuff at dinner sucked.
I said something to the staff and they acted like I had destroyed the best product in the world.
I guess with Carl's Jr.
I will stick with the burger.

Order #0118 on 1/29/2014 Carl's Jr. #7507  Item ordered: char fish combo  Gentlefolk, This meal was the most uninspired excuse for a fish sandwich.
The bottom slice of the bun was dry without condiments.
The "slice" of iceburg lettuce also lacked condiment.
There was a slight dab of what may have been a sauce further up at the level where I was to find the saddest excuse for what came out of our oceans.
It was gooey, brownish, and glued to the top bun which was otherwise toasted and dry.
I really cannot express the level if disappointment I experienced today for lunch.
To do so would make you cry and wish to toss yourself in front of a bus and end it all.
Terrible lunch today.
