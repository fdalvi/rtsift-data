I like to buy local and use local services whenever I can.
Since I need to ship a lot of packages via UPS and USPS it's super-convenient for me to use the friendly neighborhood Goin' Postal store right down the street.
Owners Bruce and Susan Weber are always ready to handle my shipping needs in a fast and efficient manner, and Becky has been super-helpful on many occasions, especially when I goof up on something.
In additional to their shipping experience and all the supplies you could need, they offer a $5 notary public service which saves me time and gas.
I highly recommend Goin' Local with this Goin' Postal branch.
Thanks to all!

I love this place.
The staff are courteous, professional, friendly, efficient....
I could go on and on.
And very reasonable prices.
I usually go here, but recently tried to mail some packages at places near my work instead.
My experience at those places made me appreciate Goin' Postal even more.
The UPS Store said they had to charge a minimum of $40 just to package anything.
That would have cost me $120 for packaging, plus whatever they would have charged for shipping.
My total for everything at Goin' Postal was around $30.
Another place was more interested in taking care of his personal life on the phone than helping me (he was trying to get a lower rate on his home cable service).
I will never make the mistake of trying to go somewhere else again.
Thank you staff at Goin' Postal!

These guys are the best.
Bruce, sue, Matt, and Becky make you feel like family.
I go out of my way to keep my mailbox here since I moved away just because it gives me an excuse to say hi.
I can't say enough about all the people working there.
