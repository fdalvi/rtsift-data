Have had two kids go through this school as well, with my son going there in 3 years.
The teachers are very active with the students, and take the time and energy to get to know their students.
Active PTO, and quite a few extra-cirricular activities as well.

I went to Middle School here back in the day.
Although those were not the best years of my life all and all I would say DSMS is a great school.
Overall I had very passionate, caring, and knowledgeable teachers who I still remember.
I was very shy in those days, but now that I think back the school still got me very involved.
I did orchestra, babysitters club, community service club, and a program where I aided for a teacher at the neighboring elementary school.
Located in a good part of Phx/Scottsdale, the school isn't the prettiest place to look at but that doesn't reflect on the school itself!

Both of my kids attended this middle school and it was excellent, many of the teachers were award winning teachers.
The kids went to Catalina island on a school trip.
Great memories.
