I love these stores.
I have been to many.
GREAT options for pizza.
Take it home, bake it yourself.
Hot and fresh out of the oven.
This was a newer location.
Much easier than my other location in Apache Junction.
And they have some new menu options.
Try it.
You won't order delivery again.

My new favorite pizza!
Hot out of my own oven.

Very convenient, nice employees, good pizza.
Wish they had more vegetarian options.

While I sat waiting for my Cowboy to be ready....pizza that is- I noticed a young gentlemen I think should be mentioned, unfortunately I didn't catch his name.
As he made pizzas he took time to respond and greet  customers, I watched as he spoke  to a small child and made him smile!
Young or old that kind of service isn't seen often enough,service with a smile goes a long way!
He made at least two customers smile, and this customer will definitely be back!

We go here all the time & our favorite employee is Marcos.
Amazing customer service from him every time we've gone there.
