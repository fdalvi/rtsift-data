As you stroll down Links Place and stare across to the Links Convenience Store, you might just think that this is another typical newsagent, one of many in Edinburgh.
However, take a closer look and you will discover that this place offers a little extra, something a bit more than your regular newsagent!
That little extra is that this store offers hot and cold snacks!
Yes, this store has expanded from its base in newspapers and sweets/crisps business and has added another dimension!
You might be thinking great, however a word of warning, the hot filled rolls (bacon, sausage etc) aren't that great, they are pretty bog standard (the rolls themselves are pretty good though).
I never tried the cold rolls but I would imagine they would be pretty similar in quality.
Cheap and cheerful comes to mind, and to be honest a hot roll, along with a packet of salt and vinegar crisps and a can of irn bru, isn't that bad for lunch.
And it certainly isn't that bad going for a typical newsagent!
