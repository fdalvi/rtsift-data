Although my aunt loves Nine West, I have to agree with Stephanie T. it has sort of lost its young appeal.
Fair enough to be honest, with most fashion brands geared to late teens, it's good that some fashion lines aren't trying to appeal to 20 year olds (and that there are some lines that 35+ can wear without looking like they are trying to be in their teens still).
I prefer Nine West on line store as it has a lot more choice in styles(and a lot more fun options).
The prices are high, although the clientele I guess are supposed to have some sort of income other than a student loan.
The service is friendly enough  and the shoes here are what one would consider practical.

I agree with the other reviewers, Nine West doesn't seem to appeal to the youngsters and students but I think the prices reflect that it's not really supposed to.
My old boss used to shop in Nine West all the time and it reminds me of her.
She was absolutely beautiful, sophisticated in her late 30's with kids but still knew how to dress effortlessly cool and classy.
I hope I look as sassy as her in my late 30's and I think Nine West is perfectly geared towards that style.
You don't want your mum picking you up from school in a pair of Louboutins, looking like a WAG but you also don't want her dressed like a boring old frump... Nine West is the perfect happy medium.
Nine West isn't somewhere I usually get my shoes.
In fact, I've only ever bought one pair of sandals from here but I can definitely appreciate it and think it's perfect for it's target audience.
