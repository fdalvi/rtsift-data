This is my regular post-haircut teriyaki stop.
Nothing too special and or amazing...standard fare that is in most teriyaki places,  but cut down to just the basic selections served in a choose-through the glass fashion.
Nothing really stands out its a pretty cookie cutter place...
I would have given it two stars...
But the $3.95 daily special Teriyaki cant be beat for a quick bite that doesn't bog u down.
Cheers!

Cheap cheap food!!
It can get slow, but cheap and authentic!
Ordered a big family size Shrimp Fried Rice, Beef Chow Fun, Hong Kong Style Noodle, and extra rice and side of broccoli for just $25!
Ate them with my family of 5, got bloated with leftovers!
Real good deal.

If you are hungry in Chinatown Las Vegas and are looking for good food on the go  You have to give them a try if you want your food fresh you can have a seat and In minutes you will have the freshest food they are simply the best in the area and they deliver too

Here's the thing.
This is cheap, delicious Chinese food and I have come here countless times.
I enjoy all of their items and they are always friendly and remember me and my order when I come on in...
The only reason they do not get a 5 star is, that they are VERY SLOW.
Especially  with larger orders.
We do not mind waiting at all, at times up to 30min... We always call ahead and show up 30min later, usually still with another 5min wait.
I have countless times seen people get upset with the wait but if you have time, it is worth it.
I will return and I already know I will wait but I don't mind... :)
