Not your typical Denny's it is funny how often I encounter a business that comes off like they don't want my money.
RUN FOR THE HILLS.
Especially at night.
You are lucky if a waiter even knows your waiting to be seated.
It might be the loud rap music playing from his pants.

Been going to this location now for about a year (mostly after 9pm) and have always had a good experience, We have received hot food that was prepared in a timely manor 99% of the time.
The night staff is about 1-2 waitresses after 9 so it can be a little wait to get served but it doesn't really change my experience.
Nice place to go when everywhere else is closed and you want a quick, pretty cheap meal.
