A friend of mine has her hair done here and loves the place.
I was looking to get a retro-pinup style done and her stylist recommended Girard who works in the salon.
He called me back shortly after I left him a voicemail and was able to book an appointment for me on the specific day I needed.
Since we had never met,  I loved that he asked me specific questions about my hair type, what kind of style I was looking for, even to text him a photo of what I was going to be wearing.
I was immediately impressed.
The salon is gorgeous.
A very cool downtown loft where the owners live upstairs and the salon is on the first floor.
Cool art hangs of the concrete walls and a teal couch serves as the waiting and stylist-consult area.
We looked online for some examples and Girard went to work.
Not only did he give me a beautiful style, but he managed to make my otherwise fine, hard-to-hold-a-curl-hair, stay put all night!!
That's pure hair engineering if I ever saw it!
Great experience!
Thank you!

I managed to find Samantha after having a fantastic cut from her a while back (so good that I literally had some dude at a stop light roll down his window to tell me that my hair looked great:-) when she was at a different salon.
I was so happy to find her at Medusa, where she is the owner.
The space is really cool - relaxing and a good vibe - and Samantha rocks!
She does a seriously awesome job, and is able to predict what you are looking for - an intuitive stylist, I guess you could say.
I left with a great cut, and was just really happy to have managed to locate her.
She is fantastic - highly recommended!

Looks like I finally found my new haircut spot since moving from LA.
Cool spot, clean, friendly staff, didn't try and up-sale me on product, and gave a great haircut  at a GOOD PRICE  couldn't be happier
