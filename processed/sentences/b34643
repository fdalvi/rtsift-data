Very very small.... maybe 10 total tables, but I've never seen them even 75% full.
It's completely tucked away in the corner of the casino, so far away that it's almost like they don't want you to know it's there.
Biggest let down, for me, is it's part of the luxurious MGM Grand Resorts (which I love), but the poker room doesn't allow you to accrue any player points/comps.
My recommendation is to take a short 5-10 min walk over to the Aria and play there.

The service was amazing.
My drink was never empty.
On top of that The waitress would bring me two drink cause she said she was going to take a break.
I lost a bit of money but felt good doing it then bad again after waking up the next morning.

Pretty good area!
Low limits and players are friendly and not too cut throat.
Just know the basic strategies and being able to pick up on play styles and you will have a good time.
I prefer playing blackjack in all honesty but this is still a nice place for a change of pace.

Tucked away in the corner I found the packed poker room.
There was a good mix of players but really low bets so I ended up in the high roller tables instead.
The people were nice here, and the drinks came fast but it felt rather/...low class ..compared to the rest of the tables/gambling areas.
The poker room at Ceasars was much better

Come play poker here, I want to take your money.

Certainly not the fanciest place in Vegas but thats part of the reason I like it.
Staff were very friendly, drink service was faster than I was drinking and their $40 and $60 daily tournaments are a lot of fun and hard to beat.
I'm a big fan of the Monte Carlo in general and undoubtedly on my next trip I'll stay at the Monte Carlo and visit it's poker room.
