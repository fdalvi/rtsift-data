I followed Ashley from JCP Salon.
Amazing!
Thank you sooo much!
Best haircut ever!
Adorable feather extentions!
Ashley cut my hair (awesome!
)  Kelly did my feather extentions (soo cute!
) Two thumbs up!
I highly recommend :)

I came here after buying an awesome deal on Weekly Deals ($30 for $120 worth of services) and was SO happy with my experience!
Amanda did an amazing job on my cut and color... even better than I could have imagined!
She was friendly, professional, and went above and beyond my expectations!
If I wasn't moving away from the Phoenix area, I would definitely continue to come here - wish I would have found them awhile ago!

Went there for threading and Dayana did a great job.
She is the first person in AZ that  I'm going back to see.
She didn't rush, I didn't have to show her sections she missed, and she's not in a mall.
Well worth the trip to Scottsdale.

Love my hair.

I purchased a HomeRun voucher for a haircut and color with Kelly.
I called to schedule my appointment about a month after my purchase, and Amanda was very helpful and accommodating.
When I arrived on Saturday afternoon, I was greeted by Kelly and only had to wait a few minutes before she was ready for me.
She asked me specifically what I wanted and listened to my precise specifications (I'm picky about my hair, but what woman isn't?).
I wanted the slightest trim possible and a brighter ombre color which I already had done, but was fading quickly.
My style and color came out beautifully!
I would have chosen 5 stars if it weren't for the salon itself.
It's just one very small room, and it gives off a super cramped vibe.
Other than that, I highly recommend Kelly!

It's great to find a brow threader in my hood and Dayana did a great job.
I can't grade this place any higher since I've been here just once.
The actual place was hard to find since the door was jammed and I thought it was locked since I came here on a Sunday.
Dayana works on Sundays only.
