Great Nail Salon.
Beautiful inside with friendly staff.
This is by far the cleanest nail salon I have ever been in.
It's close to my house and the prices are great.

Awful pedicure and manicure!
Never ever will I go back.
It might have just been the lady I had, but my god it looks terrible.
Crooked nails, polish not even covering my whole nail, and didn't do a good job removing cuticles or callouses.
When I asked her to fix my crooked nail she argued with me!
I would not recommend this place.

I found this place by accident and I am so glad I did.
The owner and her husband are amazing people.
So kind and friendly.
Warm and welcoming.
They have several large screen tvs in the salon where they place movies for you as they are literally pampering you.
I would recommend them to EVERYONE!!!!

UPDATE:  They have reached out to me after seeing my review and offered to       re due my daughters nails.
They would like a chance to rectify the situation.
Instead, I asked that the $6 over charge be refunded to me in which they agreed.
I never went back for the $6.00 but it was nice to know that they would do what they could to resolve the issue.
************************************************************************************   My experience: The salon I regularly go to is right around the corner so that is how I found out about this place.
I saw they were new and wanted to give them a try.
I took my 12yr daughter here  yesterday for a gel manicure.
She is trying to stop biting her nails so I thought the gel may help.
FIRST IMPRESSIONS: Wow, this place is modern, clean, and well decorated.
It did not have any of that cheesy decor or horrible paint on the walls like a lot of salons.
This was fresh.
The unique thing about this salon that sets it apart from other salons, is that the manicure stations were set up at bar level.
There was a movie playing on a couple flat screen TV's and the volume was loud enough for us all to hear.
Water was offered to everyone which I thought was a nice touch.
THE MANICURE: My daughter says:  The nail tech was more gentle with her than the other place we go to and she could easily understand what was being said.
She didn't like that the nail tech clipped her nails (remember she's trying to grow them out, and they were already really short, so why clip them?).
I told her she should have let the lady know she didn't want them cut.
When my daughter was asked if she wanted a design, (She knows I don't like paying extra for that stuff) she asked the nail tech if it were free and the nail tech told her she would do it for free for her.
What she got, was a clear coat w/glitter and the tips painted teal.
This looked ridiculous bc her nails are super short so painting the "tips" looked real funny.
I didn't say this to my daughter bc I didn't want to hurt her feelings.
CHECK OUT: Up at the register, the nail tech says that she painted the design for free.
I thank her and thought that was really nice of her.
She tells me my total is $30.00  This fee is higher than the place I go to which is $22 for a gel mani, but being that this place is new, I figure this is the prices they are charging.
I pay, tip, and grab a pamplet to take home.
Once home, I go over the pamphlet to see what other services they have to offer and check the price she told me.
To my surprise, a Basic Manicure (which is what my daughter got) cost $12.00 Clipping, shaping, cuticle trimming, massage and polish.
Add the gel polish $12.00 that would have been $24.00 so where did the nail tech get the total of $30.00?
She over charged me, or she in fact, didn't give the design for free like she said she did.
Either way, I got ripped off.
I will not return to a place that is dishonest.
For that reason, I will not recommend this salon.

Great mani pedi.
Gel mani lasted longer than most.
Staff was super friendly and efficient.
Plus, I got to watch Mean Girls while getting my toes done, bonus!
My new nail salon.

This place is awesome!
So clean and organized when you walk in which is extremely nice when entering a nail salon.
The ladies communicated extremely well about pricing, services, deals, etc.
All the polish is organized up on the wall with plenty of colors to choose from!
Pedicures are done in (what look like) new chairs while there are three flat screen televisions playing movies to keep you entertained.
Manicures are done at a hightop bar with individual gel stations.
Great place, amazing service, average prices!
I will definitely be back.

Its a hit and miss at times, but the shop is the nicest in the area.
They have a nail bar vs stations with integrated lights for gel curing.
A bit pricier, but 10% off with cash.
3 flat screen TVs with a movie selection you can pick from when they are slow.
I am surprised they opened next to XO Nails, which has a large and loyal customer base.
They get the overflow (like me), but they are never very busy.

I visited this salon based on other reviews and I was completely satisfied.
The staff was friendly, the service was great and the ambiance was very pleasant and inviting.
Not to mention the final product was outstanding.
Will definitely be back next time I'm in town.

Update: 90 mins for a #2 for Claude and 45 minutes for me.
They were so inconsistent.
Two women had to paint Claude's toes because the first girl (who took forever) COULDN'T PAINT or speak a lick of English; WTF?
My time was too short.
The owner doesn't pay attention or offer apologies.
We are unlikely to return, despite the pretty toes.
