They don't even deserve the one star!!!
This place is a joke horrible customer service my mom hasn't got her name tag that she ordered over three weeks ago they keep telling her they're sending it over night but nothing has shown up,she has already paid for this item in advance.
They told my mom that maybe she should just go in to pick it up when my mom lives 69 miles away and they're the ones messing up!!
Buyers beware!!!!!!!
As of today Friday she still hasn't received her item when they told her they were mailing it out on Monday!
Get your crap together WC EQUESTRIAN we will never step foot in your awful store again and we will make sure to let everyone we know how you do business and how you run your store!!

So happy to have found a store with so much to choose from.
Great, professional staff to help!!
I was looking for a specific pair of boots and they helped me find just what I needed.
Thanks!!
Location is awesome, right off I-15 and Blue Diamond.
Super convenient.

I absolutely LOVE this store.
They have everything,  I could get lost in here for hours!
Friendly and knowledgeable staff, great customer service.
I will definitely be back!!!!
I'm so glad I found you!!
