This is apparantly a gay bar/cafe(?).
From my experience of this place, I think it tries to market itself to the gay and lesbian community, but it just feels like - and attracts - a normal, eclectic crowd.
The staff are friendly and efficient, and the interior decor has a contemporary, stylish feel to it.
I haven't been to the bar but I got the impression that it's probably quite expensive and they let you book exclusive VIP parties in advance.
The cafe serves great food and prides itself in its bruschetta which is delicious.
They give you a thick slice of toasted bread with heaps of chopped tomatoes and mozzarella  which more than suffices for a lunch.
The downside is that it is quite expensive at over £4.
Blue Moon offers quality food and drink with great service, but also has prices to match.

The Blue Moon Cafe has been a fixture in the district for many a year.
Their menu is high on joyful comfort, and high on quality.
Overall, we said: "we were provided with warmly comforting dishes when that was exactly what we required.
In the unlikely event of me having a hangover at work in the future, come lunchtime my thoughts might just turn to a bowl of their lovely soup followed by some home-style treat to follow.
If your needs are for something similar, in your hour of need, I think you'll be very nicely served by the Blue Moon Café.
