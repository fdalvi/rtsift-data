A small shop that specializes in cake and candy decorating supplies.
I needed some gumpaste flowers for a wedding cake and found some beautiful ones here at a reasonable price.
The lady was quite helpful and offered some tips, as I am a fledgling cake decorator.
While the shop wasn't impressive to me in terms of its decor or size, it seemed to offer a decent variety of items from cake pans, frosting spatulas, and sprinkles to lollipop sticks and display racks.
I believe that one can order items that the shop does not have on hand.
Service is offered in English and Spanish for those who want or need it.

They have more supplies, than places like Michaels and are a lot cheaper.
I love this shop!
We bought seven items for 20 dollars...which is almost impossible to do.
I would definitely look into taking classes.
The owner is extremely friendly.

I have been looking for a cake decorating supply store for some time now.
Years really.
Sure, there is Michael's and other places like that, but they are not the same.
Although the shop is on the small side, don't let that fool you.
There is everything you would need to make cakes and candies here.
I saw cake fillings, fondant, gel coloring, flavorings, cake boxes, cake rounds, tools, piping tips, a wall of candy molds...it just goes on and on.
I am SO excited to have found this shop.
I will be back many times for my supplies.
It also helps that they are super friendly, as well as helpful.
