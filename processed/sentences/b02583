Small store with a very helpful staff.
Clean and well-organized.
If you are Catholic or Orthodox Christian,  you will find a nice selection of books, icons,  cards, gifts, crosses and crucifixes and some music as well.
Have a look for a peaceful respite in your day.

In my experience, there aren't a lot of stores who sell the items Mary Immaculate has around the Valley.
I've gone here a couple times and have enjoyed my experiences.
It may be a little overwhelming for some but there are a lot of religious books and trinkets to choose from here.
Staff is helpful and personable.
Will be returning today to purchase a St. Michael pendant as a gift to a friend who just graduated the police academy.
My only complaint is how expensive everything is!

What a great little store!
It is absolutely PACKED with books, crucifixes, statues, rosaries, icons, and various other sacramentals and holy images.
It has one of the best book selections I've seen in a Catholic bookstore, though admittedly I have only been in a handful of them.
The books are all orthodox (not Orthodox, but orthodox as in faithful to the authentic teachings of the Church) and there is a more traditional bent to the literature and images offered, which made me a very happy camper.
Their holy card selection is also awesome, I found myself taking home a handful that had gorgeous turn of the century artwork and great prayers on them.
All in all, my experience here was great, and the staff was very friendly and helpful.
My only regret is that I didn't have enough spare cash to pick up more stuff!
Also, they have Sacred Heart badges here.
How cool is that?
I purchased one and it is now tucked into my purse next to my small prayer books and chapel veil.
