I have used My Pet Nannie multiple times and they are the best!
Professional, trustworthy and very easy to work with!
I even have used them with very short notice without a problem and my pup always has a great time with them!
Also, they leave you a little report card describing what happened on their visits, which is great!
Highly, highly recommend My Pet Nannie!

I have recently used My Pet Nannie's service when I went out of town for a last minute vacation to San Diego.
I had signed up for the Bed & Breakfast package and my sitter did everything but paint the house.
They played with my Husky puppy until he just fell over and slept, they cuddled with my Rhodesian ridgeback/jake russel while watching TV and made sure my 16 year old cat was kept comfortable, petted and unattached by my puppy.
(We should note we have nanny cams to see this activity.
)  Through out the day the sitter sent me text pictures of them playing and sleeping and when I came home, not only were my dogs sleepy from all the play, but there was a very kind care note waiting for me.
They also left my home cleaned, my living room floor vacuumed and cat box had been spot cleaned.
I would highly recommend My Pet Nannie for anyone looking for the pets to be showered with love and attention if they have to leave them.

Great service.
Our dogs were well cared for and we had excellent communication with our nanny.
We will use this service again.
