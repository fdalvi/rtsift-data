First off, I love Mexican food so I know what to look for.
I have to have my hot sauce just right and the food cooked to perfection.
I have to say that they make their food just right for me.
I ordered a carnitas burrito and the meat was fried perfectly and very well marinated.
Only one negative thing was I'm not convinced the meat was fresh.
I can kinda taste thw meat a bit stale.
Kinda sucks cause everything else was perfect.
I'll give this place another try and update a new review.66

Not one of the better Roberto's in town.
Salsa is so so and they charge $2.89 for plain chips!
Everyone else charges a buck.
Food is decent.

Service is always good, and food quality is consistent.
This location is also very clean!
