Great food and great speedy service.
Both perfect English and spanish service.
I had the medium Campechana and it was delicious.
Briught me chips and meal was out without seconds.
Super friendly staff.
Family own.

First of all, I am picky.
We were looking for a good Mariscos restaurant.
I saw the other yelp reviews and decided to give it a try.
The food was excellent, fresh full of flavor, just delicious!
The other review is accurate, the food is priced a little higher than other Mariscos restaurants but the quality and taste was worth it.
We will be back.

I've been here twice so far, and everytime it's been great.
Large menu, plenty of Mexican beers, staff is super friendly.
All kinds of hot sauces.
Only negative I can say is the price, but trust me, it's well worth your money.
I'll definitely be returning in the future.
