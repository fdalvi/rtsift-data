Ye Olde Game Shoppe.
Don't be put off by the front, inside is a goldmine!
The last time I came in here there was a good balance of computer games for all 3 major systems.
But recently, because you all thought that Granny would like a Wii, they stock feels a bit watered down to accommodate.
Nintendo supplies seem to outnumber other brands 3/1.
I can understand the logic for this, because it is popular as hell, but Wii sales are starting to slow down and all the alienated customers probably went somewhere else.
Playing it safe sometimes doesn't work.
But when they do have something you're looking for, it will be cheap and the staff are quick to give you a little review of the title.
Very nice!

Whilst many commentators will slag off Leith Walk due to the amount of drug addicts, thieves and non-university educated people about, I actually quite like it.
It's good to see a thriving, bustling working class area still keep it's identity and avoid becoming either a gentrified shadow of it's former self or a boarded-up ghost town.
And it's only on streets like this that Games Master could exist.
Compared to the shockingly low trade-in prices you'll get offered at the big stores, you can come out of here with some of the best geekery related bargains in town if you're lucky.
Still no import games though, which is a shiter.

This place is a real gem.
While in most chain game stores, such as the likes on Princes Street, where you will pay up to and including Â£50 for the latest games releases, this little, unassuming place hidden down on Leith Walk will offer the same products for a much cheaper price - and usually have better stock too.
There seems to always be a good selection of games to choose from, mostly for the three main consoles - but there are always some little deals to be found, and you will get a decent price if you trade in your old games for new ones.
I only discovered this store recently, but already I have become a huge fan of it.
