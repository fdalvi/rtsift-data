Actual Date of Visit: 10/9/2011  When I first moved to Scottsdale I had no idea where to get a bed.
I went to Macy's but their prices were either about $500 or $1000, nothing in between.
The saleswoman at Macy's suggested Bedmart (I was so greatful for that)!
When I went to Bedmart, they had some Columbus Day specials going on.
It wasn't busy and my salesperson Randy was very helpful.
He was descriptive and honest, not pushy at all.
I got exactly what i wanted for a great price.
My only critique: Their delivery times are not necessarily the best.
It was difficult for them to work around my schedule.

Randy was very patient, informative, and accommodating.
He made my experience very easy and took good care of me.

Brett, our sales consultant was absolutely great!
Brett was very knowledgable and genuinely interested in finding us the best possible bed.
Their selection was fabulous and the store was very clean and organized.
I would absolutely purchase my next mattress from Brett.
