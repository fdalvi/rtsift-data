Izzi's is alright.
I wouldn't rush out to dine here.
Their sushi is great if you are new to the cuisine, but really, it is just a little bit boring, but on the plus side, it does taste much more fresh than other establishments.
The first time we went there, the best part of the meal was a prawn and fish roe salad - the last time, the dish was pretty stingy on content and heavy on the mayonnaise.
Fusion restaurants don't tend to tempt me - stick to making one cuisine good rather than trying to please everyone, it never really works that well.
Extra star for the Japanese tea, not enough places serve it.

I enjoy sushi / sashimi Bento Box lunches at Izzi.
The price is right at under Â£10 and includes miso soup.
The staff are attentive and you have the fun of finishing off the meal with a fortune cookie.
