Worst customer service I have ever received!
Make sure you try shoes on there bc once you exchange them there's no going back!!!
I even called to talk to the DM (I was told she would call me back) never did!!!
Someone else did...not a good company at all!
Shop at nordstroms!!!

I work on my feet all day sometimes up to 12 hours and I am required to wear heels or wedges.
I have purchased Cathy Jean shoes on and off for about three years and overall they have held up very well.
I am a big fan of their classic black wedge style with a knot on the top, they have had variations of this style for years and it is very comfortable for being a 4 to 5 inch heel.
I recently purchased a new pair and they definitely have a breaking in period but once they are broken in they will be fantastic, very cushioned on the arch and heel.
I have also purchased boots here which I have had one pair for two years and also taken on a trip to London and they are still looking pretty good.
I will have to retire them soon (always a sad day) but I will probably go back to Cathy Jean to replace them.
Prices are good and there is usually always a sale going on.
Prices range from $30 to $120 and some shoes are made with all synthetic and some are made with a leather synthetic blend.
Customer service at this location on my most recent visit was very good.
The cash register drawer got stuck when I needed my change but it was no big deal and the associate kept her cool.
She was very helpful and had a positive attitude.
Better service than I had received here in the past.
They used to only have manual receipts so the fact that they have a cash register at all is an upgrade and helpful to the associates and the customer.
This is a final sale store but just know that going into it.
Be sure of your purchase and you will be okay.
Overall good.
I will be back.
