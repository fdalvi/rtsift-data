We (my husband, 2 friends and I) visited Tavola last night because of a Yelp review.
We weren't as enthusiastic.
The service was great!
We ordered 2 pizza's and 2 salads.
The salads were fresh, that was a nice surprise, not bagged.
The pizza was good.
Crust was a thicker than we like.
Not a bad experience at all just not quite what we expected after the 5 stars.

My husband and I really enjoy this Pizza Stop!
They have the Greasy like wings (Butter Sauce) that I Personally LOVE!
The Pizza is Greasy But DELICIOUSE!!
They have a few T.V.
's up.
its not the most up beat joint but its Pretty Dar n GOOD!
Definatly something to try!
Take a Break from the Hut , and try this place!!
We are Ordering Wings there tonight!

So so.
Better than the other chain pizza places in Buckeye.
