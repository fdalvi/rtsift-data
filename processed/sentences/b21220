Sehr nett.
Wir hatten einen guten Eindruck von diesem Hotel.
Die Zimmer waren recht ruhig - bis auf die lauten Nachbarn - aber da kann das Hotel wenig dafür.
Das Personal war hilfreich und nett.
Das Frühstück war reichlich und lecker.
Die Bar machte Abends ungewohnt bereits um 0:30 Uhr zu.
Leider war so kein Schlummertrunk mehr möglich.
Die Lage ist optimal für die Erkundung von Edinburgh.
Wir würden beim nächsten Mal auf jeden Fall wieder hier nächtigen.

Great location, great views, slightly shabby hotel.
You can tell it's been here a while, as you can still smell the smoke as you walk in.
It's got the familiar terrible carpets and wipe-dry curtains in the lobby and rooms, and the staff are just about interested enough but nothing to impress you.
The room we had was surprisingly decent - at least compared to the lobby areas and the other rooms of our party.
We did ok. Shame about the two single beds bolted together to make a double though.
The breakfast buffet was very good - it even included haggis!
Location is fantastic.
Right on Princes Street opposite the Scott monument.
We had great views of the castle too.

For the price, not the greatest experience.
Like Craig M. says, it's fairly dated, but the rooms are passable.
Great views, if slightly noisy if you have street-facing windows.
The staff were very hit-or-miss, ranging from completely unaccamodating to friendly and helpful.
Big minuses: no WiFi unless you're in the lounge at perscribed times or want to pay 15 pounds a day for it, and no adapters for my sad USA plugs.
I was directed to the supermarket, and then to Marks&Spencer, and then they were out of ideas.
It was a good location, but if I'm back in Edinburgh I probably will not opt to stay there again.
