I first found this company when one of the arms broke off my glasses when I was away for the day in Tucson.
Because they did such a great job at their Tucson location, I decided to use them again today.
One of the nose pads broke off my glasses early this morning.
I had driven past All American's Alma School location before, so I stopped there this afternoon.
This location, just like their Tucson location, is in a nondescript older building that looks like a renovated house.
There's plenty of parking in the back of the building.
When I walked into the front door, it was as if was walking into my Grandma's house ... decor was early Salvation Army.
But I was greeted by a very pleasant young woman who took one look at my glasses and told me it would just take a couple of minutes to change both nose pads.
I sat down on an older but comfy couch to check the email on my phone, and before I was done, she was back with my glasses fully repaired!
The cost was $10 out the door, which for those of you who wear glasses 100% of the time, know was a very fair price.
Having had two terrific experiences with All American Eyeglass Repair, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them!

Stopped in to have a pair of sunglasses repaired.
They have excellent service and they were able to make a repair very quick on my Tory Burch.
I did go to other places even the place I purchased my sunglasses from.....Sunglass Hut all who were unable to do the repair.
I highly recommend All American Eyeglass Repair.

I had a pair of expensive prescription sunglasses that I accidentally broke in half.
I went several places and got no solution.
Finally the eyewear store at the local mall referred me to All American.
They put my lenses in a new frame in under 10 minutes for less than half the price of replacing them at the mall.
I would definitely go back and also recommend them to friends.
