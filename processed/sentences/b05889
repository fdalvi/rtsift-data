DO NOT go to this nail salon.
I recently was visiting Vegas for the holidays, and went here with my fiance' for a manicure.
This place should be shut down.
The manicurist cut the cuticle on 2 fingers so badly I bled and have swollen skin around my nails for 4 days now.
He sloppily put nail polish on, minus any undercoat, and had to remove all excess polish when he was done, which was a lot!
My fiance experienced a cut fingertip and sloppy cuticle removal.
I am considering calling the authorities who license nail salons  to have them look into this salon.

They have really improved since last time I was here!
First time I came here my nails ended up being a gloppy mess!
But I decided to give them another try, I love my nails!
The nail tech was really friendly and talkative, she was very gentle as well, listened to what I wanted, give them a try!
I only had to wait 30 minutes but I did come in on a Friday night, weekends are usually the busiest.

I really really really wanted to like them but they disappointed me yet again after giving them a 2nd chance, the acrylic from the bottom started coming off which is something that has never happened before and I've been getting acrylics for years, I was so disappointed .
Other than that, the nail tech was wonderful!
I just won't be coming back based on friendliness.

There prolly is some really fancy awesome nail salon somewhere in summerlin that does a phenomenal job and is way better than my ghetto little nail place BUT you can guarantee they will charge you an arm and a leg to do that.
I like this little salon.
Maybe they don't do the best of the best but they are good enough for me and my pocket.
I am simple so a lil gel manicure with French tips and same for my pedi and a wax for my eyebrows and I'm out the door within two hours :) feeling like a princess :)
