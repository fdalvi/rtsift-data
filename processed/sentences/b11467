Typical jack in the box.
Clean.
Staff is friendly.
Drive thru open 24 hours.
They have the self-serve kiosk, which means you can get free tacos from time to time.
Personal favorites include: egg nog shake during the holiday season tacos ultimate cheeseburger

Got the waffle breakfast sandwich, it was ok.  Make sure you get a pack of syrup.
It gets really messy!
DONT EAT AND DRIVE!

On Thursday, 5/8/14, I ordered chicken nuggets, fries, and mini-churros from this Jack In the Box.
I got the worst food poisoning.
I had to go to the ER, and that is the first time I have been there in 20 years.
I would stay away from this restaurant.
