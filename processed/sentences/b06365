amazing selection of frames,very friendly staff,great service, i will be back for my next pair of glasses

i have been going to Eyes and Optics since I needed glasses over 20 years ago.
Since the new rage is the old school 60's Birth control glasses I am happy to have been a trend setter for over 2 decades:) The difference with the ones I wear is that Eyes and Optics has the coolest selection of frames in the Valley.
So I can find hipster glasses, nerdy glasses or super professional looking ones.
Looking at my profile picture you can tell what I picked to wear daily.
I love the store, the staff and the doctors.
They never make you feel rushed, they are knowledgeable and very helpful.
Even if they didn't take my insurance I'd spend the money to come here because of the staff.

I go here for my yearly eye exam.
The office staff is very friendly and helpful.
The eye tech was very good at explaining every step of the prescreening exam which helped me relax.
Dr. Malik is professional and shares with you what he notices with your eyes- good or bad.
I would say you are in good hands when you go to Eyes and Optics.
They also offer a wide variety of frames for glasses which is awesome.

If you want to feel like your really going to a boutique optometrist and have lots of eye glass selections this is the place.
My drastic difference than most places in las Vegas.
