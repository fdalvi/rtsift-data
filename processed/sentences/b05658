Late night happy hour menu.
everything $1.50!?!?!
Mind blown!

Locals dive bar, with great service.
Everything on the 24 hour food menu is $2, but they have specially food on certain nights.
Jukebox is not the best, but if you ask nicely, they will turn on the TV volume louder and let you enjoy what ever is on TV.
They have 2 pool tables, which are only 25cents a game, cheapest in town.
Drinks are fairly cheap.
$1.50 for a Jake's beer (their house beer which is actually Hamm's) They have a wide variety of liquor and the standard  menu of beers.
Karaoke on the weekends with Rick D is the best, and has a very big selection of music.

1st time here with friends this past weekend.
Friends ordered the $10 steak dinner.
Comes with side salad, choice of potato, and I believe some veggies.
I do not eat steak so I ordered off their other menu which was a order slip listing what was for dinner.
I had fettuccine Alfredo with chicken.
It was eerily close to a frozen dish but you know what, it's $2.00 so who the hell cares.
I was there to drink, not eat.
Don't go in with huge food expectations.
Service is a tad slow but it looked like only one server and one bartender so props to them for working hard.
