We were very impressed with the work Just Plumbing did repiped our house.
They did outstanding work and had very reasonable rates.
They worked quickly, and were professional.
We had a wonderful experience!
Highly recommend this business!

I called Just Plumbing for a faucet problem.
All I got was a voicemail during business hours.
I left my name and phone number.
Not one call back.
Business must be booming for them, since they don't need new customers.
This is so typical for the work ethic in Casa Grande.

A few months ago I had Just Plumbing install a High Efficiency Water Softener.
I waited to write a review, as I was waiting till I could fully evaluate the entire system.
Just Plumbing sent over two clean and courteous plumbers who arrived on time.
Extra work had to be done, as I didn't have a soft water loop already in place.
With out a hitch, they began the install and additional work.
A few hours later, I had a fully operational Soft water system.
The install looks extremely clean, and well laid out.
Before purchasing from these guys, I had looked at both Home Depot and Lowe's for a softener.
While the units they sold looked very comparable, they clearly did not stand up to the quality of the unit Just Plumbing installed.
In fact, I have owned a "water Boss" brand softener and a "GE" Softener, both sold at Home Depot.
Both of these units failed on me in less than 4 years.
This is why I choose the premium product that Just Plumbing install.
Research shows that their softeners with last 15-20 years.
This alone is why I loved this softener!
So months down the road I can safely say that this softener is doing a great job!
Crystal clear glassware, whiter than white socks, and no more water spots on my faucets and shower areas is more than anyone can ask for.
I will be calling them back to install a hose faucet on my softener, so I can wash my cars and solar panels with super spot free water.
I hope this short review helps anyone looking for a softener!
