This place is so cool.
They have a great selection of the hottest jeans and super cute clothes...I stumbled across this place while at Halloween Mart they are right next door and the customer service was outstanding Lets support new small businesses this place you have to check out!

Not being one who shops.
This is one place we will return.
The owners are the best.
We stopped in to check out their selection and were greeted by the owner who was very helpful and knowledgable.
They aren't pushy, they carry a great selection and prices are great.
Highly recommend checking the shop out.
