Not being a frequent visitor to Strip Bars I can't offer a deep insight into Burke and Hare.
However, using my Edinburgh knowledge I will offer a review.
Located in Edinburgh's "Pubic Triangle" (isn't that just lovely?
) it is commonly surrounded by Lads on Tour.
I am reliably informed by all my charming male friends (and boyfriend) that the Burke and Hare is the better of all the strip clubs on offer.
I think that means as far as titty bars go, this has the best titties on offer.

Burke and Hare was the site of my first strip bar experience and - in a non-creepy way - it was pretty good fun.
We went there for my friend's 20th birthday and, at first, we all felt like sleazes and got some awkward eye contact with the barely clad ladies.
We then just settled down with some drinks and had a fun pre-drink before heading elsewhere.
The women were an excellent addition to the evening and one of them gave the birthday boy a lap dance - a truly hilarious affair!!
It was quite expensive both getting in and drinking, and there were some fairly wierd people inside, but it was great fun nonetheless.
