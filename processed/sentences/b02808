Very trustworthy and dependable flower shop...
The owner has been designing for over 20 years...she knows what shes doing!

B&B is out of business.

This place has been closed for almost two years.
Good luck trying to find anyone there!!
I would recommend Flowers by Renee as the closest and best alternative.
