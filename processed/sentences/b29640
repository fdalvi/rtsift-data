I come here for lunch and they definitely know the value of fast service.
It's fairly authentic, fast, very cheap and delicious.
You could make it in and out in half an hour if you wanted to - sit down.
I highly recommend their pho or any of their rice based meals.

If you're looking for authentic Vietnamese food with excellent service at reasonable prices, I highly recommend trying DNK.
The menu includes delicious soup dishes like Pho and egg noodle soups, the best spring rolls, stir fried dishes that are cooked with minimal oil and yummy bubbletea!

Unlike most of the local pho places, Pho DNK has an updated decor and comfortable seating.
I had a a bowl of vermicelli with a spring roll and bbq pork.
The spring roll was a let down - dried out and tough.
Other then that, it was ok.
