Did a walk-in cut.
Forgot her name, but she was a younger blonde girl who was nice.
Though my cut was a tad bit shorter than I had wanted, it still looked really good and overall I was very pleased.
She seemed to know what she was doing.
For the money can't beat it.
Will definitely come back.

Fast in and out.

Brought in my 11 year old daughter to get a haircut.
While the service was fast and the girl did a great job giving her the cut she wanted,  I wasnt very pleased with the professionalism.
The stylist were talking across the floor about going out and getting drunk the night before.
I'm sorry but I don't feel that is appropriate when you have clients around,  especially a little girl.
