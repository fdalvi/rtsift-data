Delicious frozen yogurt, great toppings and friendly staff.
Fat free = guilt free so whats not to love?

Given all the yogurt places in today's market, the flavor quality here does not impress.

Too bad I can't do zero stars.
This place is busy and everytime i get a coupon in the mail i think.....let's try it one more time.
Even with the 50% off coupon....still not worth it.
Not good at all......especially for a yogurt shop.
