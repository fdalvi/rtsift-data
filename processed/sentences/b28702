Joolz is a bit of a boho shop.
And a bit is a bit of an understatement.
But that kinda stuff rocks/floats my boat, so it's fine with me.
Again, this is a shop I avoid when my pocket's empty of dough.
All their clothing is really colourful and has flowery girly patterns.
About a couple of years ago (and yes, I do remember this), I flirted with the idea of buying this skirt for months upon months.
But I was poor, so there.
A lot of their clothes are made out of materials like hemp (their shirts are really really soft!).
They sell bags out of that material too.
The prices are actually not too bad, all things considered.
I mean, most of their merchandise costs around 20 pounds, or maybe a bit over.
Other stuff they sell: pillow cases and scarves, gloves and earrings.
Definitely stop by if you're looking to put some more colour into your wardrobe.

MY NAME IS LAURA AND I'M A JEWELLERY-HOLIC!
Joolz is a weakness of mine...it had the most amazing silver jewellery made with every semi precious gemstone you can think of!
I'm a bit of a boho chick and love unusual chunky rings, elaborate earrings, turquoise bracelets etc.
and this place is my heaven.
It's like a huge treasure chest!
They import jewellery from all over the world including Morocco, India and Canada so you're guaranteed to get one-off pieces that grab attention.
Go & spend my fellow yelpers....
