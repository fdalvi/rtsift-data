This is the closest location to my house and every time I walk in they are always smiling and very friendly.
I don't ever carry my card and I haven't memorized my account number, but it doesn't matter.
They are always happy to help!

I come here at least once a week & the staff is always friendly.
Cory is one of the nicest tellers I have ever come across.
Very happy with this bank & lucky its only a minute away :)

This review is solely based on the ATM.
I have now twice attempted to deposit money into the atm and both times the machine stated it could not currently accept deposits.
Luckily there is a Chase atm in Albertsons across the street.
