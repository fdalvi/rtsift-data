They serve wings.
Seems a lot of places in Vegas serves wings.
Before i start my review let us take a moment for all the chickens that died to we can coat their flesh in batter before we sauce them up and suck the flesh off their bones...  Draco's is another wing's place, not as big a franchise as buffalo wild wings.
Prices are...average.
Some of the things on the menu require explanation, it'd be nice to know what Draco Chips or Draco Mandu is.
I had a Draco #1 with boneless fingers instead of wings.
choose the Draco Breath (garlic Parmesan) The set came with 2 fingers, fries, "veggies" and a Draco Biscuit.
The Draco Biscuit was nothing more then a deep fried biscuit or roll.
it's texture closely resembled bread so deep fried roll i guess.
Didn't have too much flavor to it, also didn't have an oil taste so that's a huge plus.
"Veggies" a sauce container filled with pickled carrots, still crunchy with a bit of a vinegar tang to it.
Fries, uh....salted....
The garlic Parmesan seasoning wasnt too bad, lots of cheese and heavy garlic flavor.
Plenty of other flavors to try out but with Shane's Rib Shack a few stores down it'd be a while until i try this place out again.

Sorry little wings.
Don't waste your time and money.

it's no wing stop and I must say it's not a rip off of wing stop... here you will find large wings with a twist..... the sauce is not like what you might find at most places.
