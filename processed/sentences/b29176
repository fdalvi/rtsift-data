I needed to get an MMR shot for my new job.
The county health department provided me with the number for the Take Care Clinic, who confirmed that I could receive the vaccination with just a walk-in, no appointment required.
As my doctor wanted a $75 fee on top of the $85 for the vaccine, and Take Care only charged me $95.99 total, it was a no-brainer.
Due to my own error in not carefully looking at the website, I showed up just as the Nurse Practitioner was needing to take lunch.
I occupied myself for an hour, then returned.
Unfortunately, she did not return until 40 minutes after I did.
Alas, I was the first patient in the queue, and once she was ready to receive patients, I was in and out relatively quickly.
The N.P., whose name I can not recall at the moment, had very good bedside manners, and answered my questions, without any hint of being bothered by them.
(Something I've grown accustomed to from many in the medical profession)  Once the vaccine was administered, and the requisite wait time expired, she ensured I had everything I needed, including an additional copy of the record of my vaccination, with her own handwritten notes.
I had a very good experience, and would not hesitate to recommend a Take Care Clinic to anyone.
Take Care Clinics are available at many Walgreens locations, but check the website to be sure.

LOVE the Take Care Clinic.
Got me in exactly on time since I scheduled on-line, good examination, gave me the Rx's I needed, and out.
And SUNDAY appts, no missing work---just the best!
I've told everyone, and now I'm telling YOU!

Waited an hour at the clinic which had the computer system down, only for it to turn on saying that the location is closed.
This was at 11 am and no one at the pharmacy had enough sense to tell myself or the two other people waiting as well that it was closed.
And no public bathrooms (even for a child) according to the rude male pharmacy tech with glasses.
What a joke.
