Clean, nice staff.
Taste was average.
Prices are reasonable.

Clean dining space, good value, no frills sushi.
Average taste and a lack of rolls to choose from keep this from a higher rating.

Fairly expensive for the food they provide.
Service is so so.
Only got drinks when asked.
Sashimi is sliced too thick, feels like you are eating raw fish fillet than sashimi.
