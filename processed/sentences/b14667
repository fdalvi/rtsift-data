I take a lot of supplements since I workout a lot.
I know that these prices here are not a good deal.
If you're buying more than one supplement go online and you'll find better deals.
The shakes are alright but not for the prices they charge, I can get a real meal.
This meathead is not a fan of getting ripped off so I will buy my proteins and stuff online.

I come here a lot to get my craving for smoothies satisfied.
I love the post work-out smoothie, and the meal replacement smoothies.
When I'm super busy and don't have time for a meal, the meal replacement smoothie hits the spot, especially when I have them add in oats.
The prices for the smoothies are reasonable especially compared to other places, and their loyalty card has provided me several free smoothies.
The smoothies taste great - not too sweet.
The texture is perfect, and very satisfying.
This is my favorite smoothie place, and I love smoothies!

Love this place!
Jeff and Dave along with their staff seem to always make every experience a good one!
They are very knowledgeable when it comes to their products and I always see results after following their advice!
The smoothies are great but I suggest for those who lift to try their ISOPure products in the fridge, mmmm darn good.
