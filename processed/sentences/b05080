Horrible service they will come to your house start job and never come back to .
They do Kohler repairs and Kohler should lose their number!

Aqua Plumbing is the best!
I used them for a rental home I manage and not only did they perform the work I asked for, they found some issues that could have been disastrous!
I also just called them on a holiday weekend because my water heater failed.
They were very timely, cleaned up after themselves, and charged me less than the estimate!

Aqua Plumbing is a trustworthy resource for all plumbing needs.
They are knowledgeable, responsive, friendly and reasonably priced.
From replacing a water heater to fixing toilet leaks to replacing outdated faucets they get the job done right the first time.
