Have you ever walked into a building and thought "i wish my house looked EXACTLY like this place"?
well i did that yesterday, and everything in the building was for sale!

I love this place!
World Market Center quality and style of furnishing at NOT the price.
I think I'll furnish my house from this place when I get paid next!

Misti's review perfectly sums it up.
A lot of the furniture looks like something you would find at Anthropologie, but at a tenth of the price.
They have really cool home accesories as well, the terrariums are awesome and they have a nice candle selection.
I had been in here several times wishing the store had opened when I just moved here and that there is not really anything I NEED for our apartment when I saw they had an area full of paintings.
I was going through them thinking they were all great, kitschy but cool, i.e.
paintings of lions and roosters, when I noticed that they had different colored stickers on them signalling prices.
they were in the 15-45 dollars range!
I ended choosing a large painting of a greenhouse that kind of reminded me of a recent Dexter episode, but nonetheless was really cool!
Anywho, you must go.
I could spent hours here.

Cute little store downtown.
It has a lot of great things to look at, and can be the inspiration for a lot of new ideas to decorate your own place.
A bit pricey, but some things are worth it.

If you're not into buying old furniture, but like the aesthetic, I'd suggest you check this place out.
The store is a marriage of old and new merchandise that's curated for the mid-century vibe.
Although they do have vintage stuff, I noticed that most of the furniture is new.
But, that's okay!
I love Knoll-esque couches and Eames knock-offs.
Not everyone has $3k to blow on a chair!!
They also have some great accessories like...terrariums.
Tip: they're 10% off with a Yelp checkin.
I'd also look for the unbelievably cool piano strings coffee table.
Imagine that a piano died and was resurrected as a badass table.
If I had a place for it, I'd be all over it.
Also, I need to mention that their prices are really good.
$150 for a knockoff Eames rocker?
Wha???
They must be nuts.
But, I like that kind of nuts.

I was so excited to go here after reading the reviews.
I got there yesterday and there was a sign up front saying it was closed until further notice and their phone was disconnected.
Does anyone know if they are planning to open up again?
