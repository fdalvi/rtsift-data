Its a supercuts...
I take my daughter here for trim and thats all.
They get the job done, for $12.95.
Not much else I can say about that.

I have gone there twice.
I received an adequate cut the first time.
Yesterday, they butchered my hair.
It  is cut as short as a man's hair!
it is less than 1/2" all around.
From the back it looks just like a man's tapered cut- even shaved at the back hairline.
I will NEVER go back again.

Went in to get color and cut after being very disappointed with a high end salon.
I had a great time, I love my color and cut.
My stylist had 15 years of experience and knew was she was doing.
Good prices and very nice service.
I am happy.
The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because they do not style your hair.
Which I didn't mind.
I tend to like my hair better after I style it.
