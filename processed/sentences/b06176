I have been a patient of doctor duenas for a long time, he is very friendly and patient but the long waits just drive me nuts.

The dr is alright.
But that bitch in the front bugs.
I've been here a few times and have not waited less than an hour from my appointment arrival time.

Dr. Duenas is an ok doctor.
He made a few mistakes with my RX,  and tried to blame the pharmacy.
The worst part is his staff.
They lie, are slow, don't care about patients, and if you question them, you get kicked out.
He should be ashamed of his staff.
Avoid this doctor at all cost!

Dr Duenas is a great doctor.
He seems to care when I'm there and explains things to where I can understand but the only thing is his staff.
One of the girls is rude and and won't even look you in the eye.
The other girl is nicer.
The waiting time there is horrible!!
Was there close to 2 hours!
