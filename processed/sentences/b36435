During my visit I wanted to meet up with my family for some coffee and pan dulce.
I was pleasantly surprised to find both.
I actually ended up getting their green juice which was definitely green!
You can ask for a custom blend and their selection is pretty decent for a small cafe.
There's limited seating so expect to wait during rush hours but after 9am not too busy.

I have been too many panaderias, & by far this is the best one in quality, price, and service....right when I walked in I was greeted by the cashier and my first impression was...wow this place is clean...will be a regular here for sure

What a great find.
I don't have to stand in the long lines at Food City for my pan dulce.
This place is old school.
They had green shake samples, paletas, and even sell hot/fresh tamales.
Friendly staff and very clean restaurant

This bakery is AMAZING!!
Fresh bread every day!
Every single hour of the entire day you get fresh bread!
Not only do they have bread but they have some amazing fresh juices for those who want to drink healthy!
Green juices are my favorite!
BUT you can leave without getting the bolillo/ bread filled with chorizo right out the oven!
Their menudo is so good !
Haven't been to a bakery were it's so clean and the customer service and employees welcome you with a smile all the time!
I really recommend this bakery !
Cakes and desserts for any occasion are available too!
Really good bakery overall!

I've been eating pan dulce from this panaderia for some time now but I'd forgotten to review it.
Obviously the fact that I've returned says it all.
The bread is fresh and its the best panaderia in the west valley, at least the best one I've tried.
Their conchas and empanadas de calabasa are my favorite both have a mild cinnamon taste and the conchas sometimes have that orangey taste common in pan de muerto.
