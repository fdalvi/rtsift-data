Great Friendly Service.
They replace my front window and gave me a glass piece for my china hutch at not cost :-)

I own a window cleaning company, Clearly Professional Window Cleaning (you can find my business here on Yelp), and a number of my clients have used Lizard Heights Glass and been very satisfied.
Installing glass is much more involved/technical than it used to be.
I highly recommend Lizard Heights Glass.
They know their stuff, and they're just nice folks!

Exceeded my expectations.
We called and they came out the very next day, then delivered and installed sooner than promised.
Very friendly and professional.

Finally - a PROFESSIONALLY- run glass company.
From answering the phone to work done - completely professional.
Prompt.
Job well done.
Fair prices.
I highly recommend this company.

I had a windshield i needed replaced, they where quick and worked around my crazy schedule.
Their awesome, friendly, great service, and very professional.
I would recommend them to anyone.
