Used these guys a couple of years ago and they were great.
Most recent experience in feb 2013 was not so great.
Prior service was around $60.00 for a basic tune-up.
This was discussed with the owner in advance of the Feb service.
This service ended up costing $180.
Shame on me for not clarifying the charge in advance of the service.
Shame on Colonial for failing to discuss rates / increase.
My displeasure was shared with the tech.
I paid bill in full.
I fully expected to receive a call from the owner, but  I guess my dissatisfaction was not his concern.
Ergo, the negative posting.

Not only did this company fail to install my air conditioner correctly but when called back they told me it was not working because there was 'a freon  leak' that would cost me an additional $800 to fix.
Desperate to get it fixed I agreed and gave a deposit.
Rather than show up and fix I got a call from Richard saying that his brother wouldn't let him do the job for that amount and despite a written quote and deposit refused to correct his work.
Bottom line I hired a legitimate firm who fixed problem-there was NO Leak as they claimed only poor installation on their part.
This firm is NOT to be trusted.
Richard is like a poor used car salesman.

The blower unit in my attic was acting up, so Richard came out and decided that the blower wheel and motor needed replacing.
He ended up charging me $300 for the $80 wheel, $700 for the $95 motor, and $300 in labor.
Yes, it was Saturday, yes it was very hot in my attic, but $1300 for $185 worth of parts seems a little steep.
The project took around 4 hours, and I completely could have accepted $100 per hour for labor, plus parts, but what he charged me was completely unacceptable.
