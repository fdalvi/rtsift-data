A new gas station that opened up in the area a few months ago.
Bright, clean, large convenience store.
Right next to Target and Win Co.  Best part?
Coke slushies for cheap!

Can I say it's about time a gas station opened up between Costco and Ann road?!
A large, cheap convenience store with cheap gas that you don't need a Costco membership for?
I mean, what else could you ask for!!
It's probably the nearest gas station near my neighborhood that actually has a pretty big convenience store :)   Need to start a road trip with 100s of gas station snacks?
AMPM is the place for you :)

Easy to get in and out location.
Plenty of pumps, nice car wash and lots of drinks/snacks are available.
The staff are usually friendly but there is a pay at the pump feature making it super convenient!
Tip...bring cash unless you want to pay the extra surcharge!
