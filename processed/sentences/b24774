This guy does the cheapest work possible and cuts corners.
He was on the list of covered dentists when I had a Sam's Club dental plan...
He's very friendly and funny, but that laughs stop when you find out he's a poor quality dentist.
He is also useless when it comes to avoiding mercury in dental work -- he doesn't think mercury is a problem.
JUST DON'T!

Was just back at my favorite dental office, I went to the Scottsdale office today,I usually go to Phoenix  But had a toothache and needed to be seen ASAP, So I called and talked to Sandra, she  was wonderful, she got me in right away.
Had all my pictures from the Phoenix location moved over along with my paper work.
I saw Dr. Brannon, Great Dr.
Very professional office was clean and I was able to get my tooth fixed same day with a small wait.
I always recommend these guys, Two different personallities but both are Awsome.
Thank you for fixing my tooth and me leaving with a SMILE:) see you guys in 3 months..

Dr. Brannon does way more than provide quality dental work, but he gives you the context behind his prognosis so that you truly understand the how's and why's of your dental health.
For those who are looking for more of a partner in health rather than a customer type of relationship, go check out Dr. B.
