For Gilbert Wells Fargo Banks...
This is my 1st Choice because of the Customer Service & No pressure banking.
Other banks are pushy about signing up for Credit Cards, Savings Accounts and who knows what else...
But not this bank.
Fast, Efficient, Friendly, Free bottle of Water (YEAH BABY!
), Smiles from the Employees... You won't dread walking in to this bank unless your Broke & the bank won't give you a loan...
But thats not their fault!

Went here to cash a settlement check from a car accident I was in.
I bank with chase but because it was a Friday afternoon when I got my check, I didn't want to wait for it to clear so I went to the bank it was drawn on.
The bankers were pushy.
The teller told me she couldn't help me when I declined her offer to open an account and when a banker FINALLY saw me after 15 minutes, the whole sales pitch started AGAIN.
I let her know that I understood it was her job to solicit my business but I was happy where I was.
She wouldn't let it go!!
Finally I asked her if she had ever considered going to work for chase.
She said no and that she was happy at Wells Fargo so I asked again but this time mentioning it was an awesome bank and the people are friendly.
She said again, this time upset, "I'm happy to be a part of the Wells Fargo team!
"  I looked at her and said, "Now you understand what it's like to be harassed about something you have no interest in even after feeling that you've made yourself clear.
"  The teller then cashed my check and I left.
Next time I'll wait for my checks to clear.
Wells Fargo sucks.
