Friendly service here.
Got may battery issue taken care of, nice staff, good price.
Will come back.

I have been coming here for almost 20 years for service on my vehicles, and they have always been fantastic to work with.
Not once have I ever called into question their assessment of what needs done to my vehicle nor have they ever tried to "encourage" work.
Two years ago, for some reason, I took my car to one of the Brake specialist places because I wanted to take advantage of a $99 brake special.
The place told me I needed rotors, calipers etc to the tune of $450.
I told them "um...no", went to Firestone, and they told me I only needed pads and I saved over $300.
Lat year we went to a Kia dealership on Camelback rd because my wife's a/c wasn't blowing cold.
Dealer said the compresor was out, it wasn't warranty work, and it was several hundred dollars.
Took it to Firestone, and got a call an hour later that the a/c belt had frayed and slipped, and it cost me about $45.
These guys are very honest and fair.
They do not cut corners and may not necessarily be the cheapest place around, but their work and work ethic are solid.

I really like the quality of products they offer and have purchased tires for all my cars for years at Firestone.
I always get the road hazard warranty because it is valid at any location and they are all over the country.
I have had to use the warranty many times because of a nail or something else and it has paid off for me.
Service department is always helpful and friendly.

Quick, very courteous service.
I mean service like the old days, and I'll now go out of my way to come back.
Big thanks to Dan for getting me in and out in a flash.
Very impressed.
