They do a great job.

After doing business with Yee's Laundry for many years, I had to find a new cleaner since they closed.
My first visit to Block was positive and they took care of my items in a timely fashion.
However, I did notice some red (dye) stains on four of my tailored dress shirts.
I was very upset, as it could have only come from the most recent service on the shirts.
When I brought the shirts back to the store, the owner/manager looked them over, and was puzzled as to what it could be.
But, he assured me they would take care of the matter and get the stains out.
I wasn't sure they could do it, but to my surprise, they did...and they did a good job.
Quite frankly, I thought for sure they would tell me to go pound sand.
But I was very pleased to see them take care of the problem with no questions asked.
They were still not sure what could have caused the red dye stains on all four shirts, but I am relieved that they got them out and did so in a very quick manner.

I've had a hard time finding a good cleaner in Madison.
Block has been around forever.
The storefront is unassuming.
Staff is always helpful.
Prices, average.
However, they do an, ok job.
I'm a little disappointed because I specifically asked them to get some salt out of my husband's pants and they didn't do a very good job, however other items I've taken to them have been fine.

Had a men's dress shirt laundered here and they got the sweat stains out really well.
Also dry cleaned a cashmere sweater and was satisfied with the quality ($2.25 to get a men's shirt laundered and $6.25 to dry clean the sweater).
A button fell off my shorts and they sewed it back on (although they used a different button) for less than $2.
They did the repair in about an hour.
Very friendly service and quick turnaround.
