The staff is friendly, they have a big selection of different things and new things are put out all the time.
Make sure you check your CDs and DVDs because there's a good chance it'll be to scratched and won't play when you get home!

I love the diversity and massive quantity of products.
It's not a thrift shop so you're not going to find underpriced treasures but you might find something you need/really want.
Like another reviewer stated, it's probably a good idea to price check against amazon while shopping.
