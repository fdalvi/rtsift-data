I love this little place.
The duck fat toffee and the brown butter carmel corn at awesome!
I will be back!

This place is a little hidden.
I have walked by many times and never even noticed it!
I stopped in an ordered dessert with friend.
I had the Tres Leches---it was so very good!
Great portion too---big enough for sharing.
While I was eating, one of the employees offered me a taste of there carmel bacon popcorn---it was so good I bought three bags!!

I came here because I wanted to buy local gourmet popcorn to send to a friend as part of a care package.
I first tried to go to Yuri's, but it was closed down.
Second, I tried this place.
It is located inside a shopping center and a little hidden away if you aren't looking closely.
The inside is cute and quirky with lots of treats laid out everywhere.
I was really happy to see they had lots of bags of caramel popcorn prepared for sale.
I was a little concerned that the popcorn would not stay good if I had to send it via mail, but the bag indicates that it should stay good for 2 months!
The packaging of the bag was really cute too.
The price of the popcorn was on the high side - more than $8 per 8 oz.
bag.
And the flavor of the popcorn was just regular.
I got the "junk food" variety which came with caramel popcorn and caramel covered potato chips and peanuts.
Nothing about it blew me away (I actually did not like the potato chip bits), so I can't say I'd make the trip to come here again for the popcorn - but I would be willing to try something else on their menu.
**Updated to add that two weeks later the unfinished bag of popcorn is still sitting in my kitchen, so it was clearly underwhelming.
I decided to just toss the rest.
Also take note that their summer hours mean they don't open until 11 a.m. and close at 6 p.m.
