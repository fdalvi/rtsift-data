As Homer would say: "ahhh, doughnuts!
"  But that said, Krispy Kreme is known for their lighter than air glazed doughnuts for good reason.
This is a good location with many upscale shops located in this open air mall.
The service behind the counter is good and fast.
Also, the owner is actively involved in local non-profit work: "Guests can also participate in the celebration of Breast Cancer Awareness Month(October, 2010) by purchasing a second dozen doughnuts for a discounted price of $5, of which $1 will be donated to the Phoenix Affiliate of Susan G. Komen for the Cure .
Already at an average of 1,500 second dozen sold each week..."  So stop by and purchase that second dozen for a good cause!
Enjoy!

Ok...
I'm not from around these parts, so maybe I'm spoiled.
But what happened to the fresh Krispy-Kreme experience?
The 'hot donuts now' sign?
These things make Krispy-Kreme unique.
Take 'em away and you're left with just a plain donut shop serving overpriced donuts.
Luckily, I was getting a dozen to go back to the condo where a quick trip through the microwave will restore these puppies to their former glory before being devoured by my donut deprived family.
The donuts themselves are of a different texture than others, but they are small, so $10 for a dozen are truly a once in a great while experience.
I visited this shop at 8am on a Thursday and there was only one other person in the shop.
The girl at the counter was ready to go & assembled my dozen quickly and with a smile.
Overall, the visit was good, but I miss the old experience.

This location is CLOSED- out of business as of Aug 2011
