Love these apartments.
Found online and was out of state and didn't see the grounds or apartment until I was in state.
Couldn't have found a better place.
Love the view.
The pool is always nice.
I have lived here for about 5 months now and didn't even know that there were people living in the same building as me besides the little girl above me.
The online stuff is very helpful and fast.
Got a nice close car port for a little extra the night grads are friendly.
