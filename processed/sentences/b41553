Really friendly staff, helped me w my purchase and we're very helpful answering all my questions.
I will make all my firearm purchases there.

I started using these guys more when they moved to Decatur.
I have to say I'm impressed with what I've seen.
Good gun smithing and quick turnaround.
David always responds to email and messages in a very timely manner.
I'm not used to that level of good customer service in the gun biz.

I have purchased firearms and firearm accessories all over Vegas for the past 6 years and have not seen customer service as a priority.
Well that has changed.
I purchased a new pistol from the gang at Marxman.
I had stopped in on Saturday to inquire about the gun and was told it was not instock but would have more Tuesday.
Tuesday I received a call they were in and were holding 1 for me to look at, I arrived at 5:15 and by 6:00 I was driving home with my new purchase.
What sets Marxman apart is their customer service!
Each member of staff was eager to help, they answered any and all questions.
I have found MY gun store and they have gained a new customer!
Highly Recommend!
