The place feels like a depressing free county medical clinic and " support staff- eg takes your blood pressure and weight etc.
seem uncomfortable with the public and unprofessional- but once you see one of their PA's - they are excellent at diagnosing and ordering the right tests etc.
Very Impressed with all Dr Q's PA-C's on staff BUT ... heres the good news!
The doctor (not actually a doctor though- he's a PA-C- Physicans assistant) named Peter T. was Awesome!
He listened carefully, made a perfect diagnosis, ordered x-rays, took alot of time with me explaining things, etc.

We were only ones there and within 10 minutes the place was full.
The Doctor-[she is a Doctor], not a PA or NA, was very attentive and informative.
Took plenty of time to explain everything involving her diagnosis.
Will definitely go there rather than to primary care physician who uses PA's and NA's.

I have been to plenty of urgent cares due to my health issues and let me tell you that this is the best one so far!!
The doctor explained more to me than any doctor has ever done in the past.
& yes this is an actual DOCTOR not a pa or anyone of that sort.
The rest of the staff is friendly, some not as professional as others but at the end of the day what matters most to me is the doctors treatment.
If I go to a clinic where the staff is the best but the doctor does not care one bit then it doesn't cut it (which has happened to me before).
I will definitely be going back, making them my primary care and referring all my friends and family!
