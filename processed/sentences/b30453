Karla is the best!
I went to a nurse in town and then some other tattoo'd girl with piercings ( never let someone all pierced touch your face).
I now have all the black removed from my brows and little skinny hair strokes in a couple of colors.
Had my eyeliner done in purple and I love that too!

Karla is by far the best when it comes to permanent Make-up and caring about people!
Karla fixed my brows, that were gun metal black and too arched, and made them look nice and brown again.
Karla also removed a lipliner I had done in Vegas too by someone else (BIG MISTAKE) but I had not know about Karla at the time; but Karla removed the lipliner that was placed above my natural lip line and saved my face!!!!
I would NOT recommend anyone else but Karla and Wake Up in Your Makeup if you are thinking about geting any type of permanent makeup.
This is your face!!!
Karla does care!

I have always wanted to get permanent makeup, but could never decide on who to go to.
After asking around and getting a lot of input from my friends I found Karla Kwist!
I am SO happy that I did!
I had my eyebrows and eyeliner done a week ago and I am so excited about the way I look and feel!
Karla is such a wonder!
She is so educated in the permanent makeup field.
I knew right away I was in capable hands.
Thank you, Karla, for the new me!

I went to Karla for eyeliner and I couldn't have been happier with my results!
She talked to me about the procedure, and was very knowledgeable.
She answered all my questions and more!
I have had two friends go to other places in town and come out with horrible results.
I sent them to Karla and she was able to help them correct what had been done previously.
It also doesn't hurt that she is one of the nicest people I have ever met, and I will continue to go to her for all of my permanent makeup needs!
I wouldn't trust anybody else with my face!
