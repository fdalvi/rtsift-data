What a beautiful facility.
( I was there for a good reason CCW).
Didn't see the whole place but sure liked what I saw.
Customer service was FAST and I like that it is somewhat centralized and was easy freeway access.

AWESOME Facility!

Horrible customer service and really long wait times for a simple report.
I've waited over a half hour to file a stolen car report and the woman who assisted me had an attitude problem.
They have their system set up like a dmv office where you wait for your number to be called to get any assistance.

ok so coming to this type of places i always expect to be treated bad and rude but i was wrong!
the location was easy to find and right when i was walked in there was a line and then to the left you see the people waiting kinda like the DMV.
when it was my turn to step up the lady at the window greeted and i told her what i was there for and she explained what i had to do then she gave me a ticket.
i went into the other room and started to fill out some paperwork and next thing i knew my number was already called up!
keep in mind it was pretty busy too.
I was in and out of this place quicker than i though.
all the staff was so friendly and didn't make you feel bad or treated you any different here!

If you think the DMV lines are bad you are in for a surprise.
Leave a whole day open if a record check is needed.
