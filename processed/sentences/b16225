I absolutely love taking my dog, Lola, to the Pink Poodle for her grooming.
We've been going to them for a few years now (since they were at their last location), they are awesome!
We usually book appointments with Nicole.
My dog has really short hair and most grooming places can't get her bows on right, but Pink Poodle can!

These guys are great!
I took my dog here on a walk in basis to fix a bad cut from another groomer.
They bent over backwards to help me out as well as take the time to make sure they understood what I was expecting.
They were all very friendly and helpfull.
We will most deffinately be returning

Those nice ladies have been able to accommodate my four dogs (yes, I said four dogs, get over it!
) all on the same appointment and they gave me a discount on the top of that!
The job was impeccable.
My four babies seemed very happy and stress free after their appointment  The shop is very pretty and the staff is professional and knowledgeable.
Will definitely come back!

My Baby has never looked this good.
And she was so happy.
Thanks for the great service.
I will be  back!

They did an amazing job with my overly furry and shed-tastic corgi.... he got the works (brushing, trimming, nails and teeth) for $45...
I was so impressed with the cut...most places don't take the time to make it as perfect as they did and charge more!!
I will definitely bring my corgi back here.... they were very nice and kind.
They only accept cash or check!

Pink Poodle is excellent.
I have two Poodles and always bring them here since I moved to Vegas in 2007.
BETH  is the best she will take care of your dog.
Fully recommend.

Excellent service.
Very organized.
Several groomers on staff.
Large client list so call ahead for an appointment.
Been in this location and same owner for several years.
Reasonable prices.
Treats our babies with love and care.
Highly recommend!
