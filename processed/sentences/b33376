This is a modest eatery found inside the Phoenix Oriental Market.
The menu is short - basic pho, rice, and noodle dishes ranging in price from about 5 to 8 bucks.
The big bowl of steaming hot pho is tasty and well-flavored with aromatic herbs and comes with the usual side plate of mint and crunchy fresh bean sprouts.
The dining space itself is a simple no-frills area, partly open and surrounded by the fresh and refrigerated produce section of the Asian food market.

This place is just OK.
The Pho there is OK, nothing exciting honestly.
I've only been to a few pho places but this one is probably at the bottom (not saying that it's bad though.....just comparing).
The place is very clean.
The pho is served in a bowl that's too small to be honest, I didn't have any room to put the bean sprouts in without it seeming like it would overflow the bowl.
The fried rice is...well....average at most.
I wasn't the biggest fan, but once again...wasn't awful, i've just had better.
Lastly I had thai tea boba.
A bit too sweet for my taste, with not enough boba (which they also "accidentally" overcharged me for (they fixed the problem).
I looked over my bill and things didn't really add up...it seemed as if certain things were more expensive than i recall seeing on the menu.
Nonetheless, I probably wont come back here, but I guess it's worth a shot for curious restaurant goers.

Service was good but food was average, prices were high compared to other PHO houses.
