Great prices, nice crew, very informative.
They were very prompt and completed the work in time less than they estimated.

About 18 months ago we used Ellsworth to do some fairly major work on the AC unit at our rental house ($1000).
We purchased their 3-year preventative maintenance plan whereby they check-in on the unit every six months and recommend any required service.
I would expect that they would take the lead and stay on top of these six month visits (since they have been paid in full, and each time they've gone out, something was recommended and we've had them do the work).
But now I have had to set a calendar reminder so I can contact them so they'll go out, and even that takes 2-3 follow-up calls to make it happen.
When they get out there, they are great and seem very reasonable and fair.
It's just getting them out there that is the challenge.
