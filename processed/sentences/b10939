Basic gas station and car wash.
Car wash is not so bad.
Free Vacuums to show they care.
No Diesel.

Great quality gas!!
Always nice to get a little Techron in the tank, to give it a nice cleaning.
Helps my V8 run smoother too.
That's for sure!

standard Gas Station.
Chevron with Techron.

$15/mo for unlimited car-washes?
in hawaii, we'd pay an arm and a leg for that.
i don't know about other stations here, but the carwash deal they have is awesome in my opinion.
the car wash procedure is so easy like a, b, c.. you just drive up to the guy at the window, he meets you on the other side to scrub your car a little and you drive right through.
it's quick, convenient and the best part is that you can go as much as you want to, like daily.
i give the wash itself 3.5 stars because it doesn't dry too well.

This place over inflated my tires which could have been extremely costly if the tires had blown.
Do yourself a favor and get a tire gage and add air as needed based on what your tires are rated for.
Thankfully when my sensor went of I took my car to Goodyear and they took the extra air out.
