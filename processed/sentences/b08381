I love a good buffet!
This one has many selections to choose from.
You can have all the steak you want - no limits there.
Fried shrimp, chicken & dumplings, salads, desserts.
Yum-o!
This is a very traditional American style buffet.
Adults Dinner pricing is approx.
$10.99 per person - not too shabby.
Would definitely recommend

If you want disgusting food, it can be had much more cheaply.
Or for free, out of a trash bin.
I suppose if you're only eating once in a while and need to stuff yourself when you do then this place is passable.
Personally, I'd rather skip a meal than go here.
And yes, American buffets are infamously bad, but even so this place is terrible, and rather dirty.
You're better off going into [whatever supermarket is in that plaza now] and buying some food there.

I love buffets but this place has gone down hill.
I was never really that crazy about this place but it went from about a 2.5 to a 1 since the last time I was here.
Mac an cheese was watery, chicken alfredo was blah.
Nothing was "bad" it just was not good.
They had some enchiladas that looked like they were from a TV dinner..
I managed to find some fish and some smoked sausage that were decent and ended up eating mostly salad as it was fresh.
I would not recommend going here and I will not be back anytime soon..
