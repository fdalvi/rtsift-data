Barbara is the best!
Come see her and be amazed.

I have been Barbara's customer for over 2 years now and I am in awe on how on point she has been with everything  that has come and gone in my life!!
She knows what she is doing!
And I had been to my share of psychics who just took my money and said all the things I wanted to hear.
She helps you find your way with her accuracy and wise words.
She really dedicates her time to you and makes you feel like you're family and not just "some customer"...
I am forever grateful for having run across this amazing person and experience and will continue checking in :) Thanks Barbara!!
Come check her out!
You won't be disappointed!

She was pretty good.
I wanted her to dig in more and tell me more with specifics.
She got a lot  right though

Going to see Barbara was truly an amazing experience.
She made me feel completely at ease, like I was talking to an old friend.
I was blown away by how many things she knew about me and was able to guide me expertly through some tough choices.
If your looking for a reading with someone who is caring and doesn't waste your time and money stating the obvious, Barbara is exactly who you should  go see!!!

I am not sure if she was not able to connect to me, but she gave be a "cold" reading.
Not telling me anything specific about my question.
Rather she said many general things that could be applied to anyone such as "your a good person but when you need help no one is there for you".
She then tried to push me to purchase a meditation to fix my situation for $300.
