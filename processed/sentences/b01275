Great service, efficiency.
I arrived at 4pm and was in my car by 425pm!
Thanks for a great job, guys!

To save money, I took my Mini Cooper for an oil change here but you have to bring your own filter, drain plug and filter removal tool.
The techs were very friendly too.

Every 3000 mi!
I have been coming to Jiffy Lube for about 10 years!
They always know what to put in my cars, know what was put in them last time and never over charge me!
They are very quickand clean!
They usually find me some kind of discount I didn't even know they had!
Over all, they are Great!

I enjoy this location.
I've had bad experiences at other large chain shops.
This place always takes care of me.

So far so good.
I'm from NM where jiffy was great.
I hope to find the same here.
Was greeted right as I stepped out of my car, they gave me the rundown of a basic oil change and there inspections.
That was nice.
10 min then I will set up AZ account and shale see how long it takes em to know it out.

SLOW SLOW SLOW.
We waited almost 45 minutes for them to change the oil in two cars that were in progress before we ever arrived.
Then it was another 30 minutes to change our oil.
No "jiffiness" here.
Always try to up sell you unnecessary services and products using fear tactics.
We won't be back.
