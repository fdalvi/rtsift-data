I love this place.
They always greet me with a smile and perfect grooming every time.
Same shopping center as the walmart, I always take my pomeranian in for grooming and ofcourse nothing but the best for my baby.
lol.

Recently changed dog groomers because my mom was dissatisfied with the cuts from our previous one.
My mom dropped in just to inquire about the price and when they told her $25 for both of our dogs, it made her book an appointment immediately since it was $17 less than our previous groomer.
Took our dogs in (poodle and pekinese) and picked them up and both looked great!
Poodle (girl) had real bows which weren't just tied up ribbons and the pekinese (boy) had a real handkerchief tied around his neck.
They also did not require shots paperwork like other groomers, I don't know if that's a good a bad thing?
Less of a hassle for dog owners I guess since you don't need to bring it in.
I was also worried because its kind of difficult for new groomers to get acquainted with new dogs but thankfully they were able to manage since we got our dogs perfectly fine.
This is definitely our new groomer, yay!

Love this groomer.
Sue is awesome and wonderful.
Very professional and Shiro loves her.

I love this groomer!
They where very kind to my dogs and made them look amazing!
I have two afghan hounds and they looked so cute after their baths and haircuts!
My dogs are a lot of work and they charged me very little!
I really like this groomer and I think even though I am moving to other side of town I'll still drive over here to bring them in.
Sue and Brenda both very nice people!
They gave my boys little bandanas- soooo cute!
