So I needed to buy a replacement light fixture for my cookie cutter home in Vegas.
It's one of those places where the HOA goes nuts when one small thing is out of place.
After a series of phone calls I finally found that the required fixture could be bought at statewide lighting, so off I went with a sample fixture to make sure I got the right one.
Dealing with this shop was the most hassle free part of the process, the guy who ran the place was really friendly and helpful he got the part I needed and even helped me fix the sample part I brought with me!
It's sort of hard to explain but the sample fixture has three planes of glass, one of which was broken the guy who ran the place took it apart and replaced the broken glass for me... all without being asked.
On top of all that he gave me the fixture at the contractors price, which is so much less expensive than the retail rate!
If your in Las Vegas and need a lamp check this place out!

I just had an experience similar to what Aaron reported last year, only my need was for house numbers.
The people at Statewide were ABSOLUTELY AMAZING at helping me find the product I needed to keep my butt out of the HOA doghouse.
It was only a $12 transaction, but they treated me as if I were their best customer.
Many thanks to them for their amazing customer service!

Omg what a crap hole this place is!
The"showroomm"is very dark and they have no selection or stock.
And rude person at the desk.
