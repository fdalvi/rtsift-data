I can't say enough good things about the shop.
I went searching for a diesel specialty shop after a 2 month long accident repair nightmare.
I'd lost confidence in my truck from all the breakdowns and was on the verge of selling it.
A search on Yelp showed no diesel specialty shops on the west side, so I turned to Google and found this out of the way gem.
Lance was phenomenal, calling me on a regular basis to let me know what was going on, and (most importantly) not treating me like a stupid woman that only knows where the key and the gas pedal are.
We'll definitely be going back there for any other work that comes up on the truck.

I've used Chucks on a couple of occasions, most recently to tune up my classic car.
Every time I've used them it's been a good experience with the work done right.
They kept me informed of what was going on and were willing to talk to me in detail about what they planned to do and what they did and why.

Historic Institution filled with the coolest cars you've ever seen.
Great service, good prices, cool guys.
5 *'s.
