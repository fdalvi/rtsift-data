Dr. Nelson is a wonderful woman and doctor!
She was the first out of 4 drs who I felt truly comfortable with the care of my 5 yr old child.
She did an amazing job on his surgery and if you're looking for a dr who shows respect and true ability to make your entire process as easy as possible, she's the one to go to!
She went to the extent of giving us her home phone number in case we needed to reach her post surgery for any questions or concerns.
Truly gifted!

We had been to many pediatric eye doctors for my doctor who had a cornea transplant.
We happen to see Dr. Nelson initially by accident when my daughter was in the hospital.
I cannot come up with enough words to express my graditude for Dr. Nelson and how she has attempted to help my daughter see.
It is annoying to wait so long for her in the waiting room, but I would wait half a day for my daughter to see Dr. Nelson because I trust her with my daughter's eyes.

The people that work the front desk are the rudest people I have ever met.
745am appointment didn't get in to 930am see the Dr. For 5 min and wait 30 more min back in the waiting room.
Done this routine for the past 2 years.
I am over it going to find a different Dr. the plus side of it is that the dr is very nice.
She should fire the front desk staff and start fresh.
Do not recommend this office unless you like wasting your whole day at the Doctor office.
It's kinda like you are at the DMV
