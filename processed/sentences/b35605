So happy to find Kim's after a bad experience with CVS.
Keith is very helpful.
It's nice to work with a pharmacist who is knowledgeable and caring.

Kim's pharmacy offers fast friendly service!
Best part is that your prescriptions are filled very quick and they are always in stock for your medications.
