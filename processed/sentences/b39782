Not the best Hilton has to offer, location is good but more than a resort this place looks like a remodeled WWII bomb bunker.
Other than that service is the best, most important the beds are top notch and the food is good.

I attended a conference located at the Hilton down the street from this property and stayed here for 5 nights.
The attendees who stayed down the street at the Hilton were frustrated by the lack of soundproofing between the rooms.
I never once heard a peep from any of the adjacent rooms during our stay.
I had a spacious room - king bed, couch, chair, desk, TV.
I also had a dressing area with a mirror & vanity stool separate from the bathroom area.
I loved that.
The hotel's amenities appeared very well kept up and the staff was friendly.
I ate at the hotel buffet for breakfast everyday but probably wouldn't have if I was paying because it is $14.
No mini fridge in the room - otherwise it would have been perfect.

We found this place on Hotels Tonight for $80 for a Sunday night.
The location was close to Mills Street & ASU which is right where we wanted to stay.
The front desk staff was very friendly and knowledgable about things to do and places to eat in the surrounding area.
They also have a shuttle that runs 24/7 that will take you anywhere you want for FREE, pretty cool!
The Bad: The bath towels were as rough as sandpaper.
Seriously like Motel 6 status.
