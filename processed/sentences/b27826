I followed my hairdresser, David Quan, to this new spa.
It's immaculate , offers many salon and spa services and has a very friendly staff.

This place is a gem!
I was at the pool with a friend when I noticed how bad my feet needed a little TLC.
I used the mobile Yelp to find this gem that was convenient located around the corner from my house.
My friend and I walked in are were greeted right away.
We inquired about getting pedicures at the same time.
They made the arrangements and called in an extra person who was there within 10 minutes.
They took us to a room with two adjacent massage pedi chairs and flat screen on the wall.
The set-up was pretty cool and private.
The owner offered us something to drink and I suggested some wine, he responded happily and brought us two delicious glasses.
This is not at all like the little Asian places.
The products they used were superior and days later I can tell the difference.
Super clean, super friendly, super private.
Check it out.

Now part of Euphoria salons, this place has it all.
The other hairdressers seem a bit uptight and not too friendly.
Fortunately, I see Sondra.
I have been her regular for years because she always does good work.

First time to a Euphoria Spa.
My friend and I booked massages but had to book an hour apart because there's only 1 massage therapist.
We were told there would be a quiet place to wait within the Spa when we booked.
When we arrived, one was taken back and the other was left in the hair salon waiting area for an hour to listen to pulsing music and the constant people coming and going.
NOT relaxing at all.
Not what we were told would happen.
Won't be returning.
