WOW!
Joanna can make anything look good on anyone!
All is takes is the right tailoring.
For the first time in my entire 30 year old life, I had to have my bridesmaid's dress taken in (thanks, low carb!
) and Joanna made this dress look great on me (well and the help of steak and salad for every fricken dinner for a month).
Totally affordable too- she is nice and very talented.
Go see her!

Went here as I needed a shirt tailored for my wedding.
Listened to Yelp reviewer's suggestions that Joanne does a great job.
Big mistake.
The price was right but when I picked up the shirt she had made a total mess of the seems running from under-arm down to the cuff (on both sleeves!
) .
They were all twisted and had threads hanging all over the place.
When I returned to her she tried to blame her poor work on the type of seem that was on the shirt...which is the exact same type of seem I have on all of my dress shirts (which I have had tailored before without a single problem).
If she had admitted someone made a mistake I would have respected that as mistakes happen, but to try and blame poor workmanship on someone else is inexcusable - especially for a stitch that is used on almost every men's dress shirt.
Terrible experience.

I take all of my pants to Joanna for tailoring.
Whether it is jeans or dress/work pants, she does a terrific job and the price is great!
I'm short, so I always need some of the length taken out of my pants, and she does it quickly, does it well, and replaces the hem for about $12 per pair.
I've never had anything else tailored (shirts, dresses, jackets), but I can say that I have never had any problems with pants, and I recommend her to all my friends!

I have been taking pieces to Joanna for years.
She has altered vintage prom dresses, turned flare jeans into straight-leg, let out sleeves and hems, and even recently stitched up a tear in my cashmere pashmina so beautifully that you can barely detect a scar!
She does the best work and is SO pleasant and nice.
(I've never met an employee at Joanna's who was anything less than lovely.
) I would say that the prices are very reasonable--comparable to what I used to pay in Queens, NYC.
For $18 she took outmoded flared jeans and turned them into a straight-leg pair that I'll be able to wear forever!
I would recommend Joanna for any job.
Fantastic work.

I've been going to Joanna for all of my tailoring needs for several years now.
She does a fantastic job.
Her prices are reasonable, and her work is excellent!

I take all my clothes to Joanna, they do a great job and can generally rush anything in a couple days.
Clothes come back fitting perfectly and you always feel better when your clothes are tailored to you!
