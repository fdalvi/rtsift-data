Wonderful and warm atmosphere.
I am a "regular.

Lovely!
Housed in an historic building, the cafe makes good use of the charm of its location.
Original windows & wood floors, calm, muted colors on the walls.
But the bathroom is modern and very clean.
The coffee menu is extensive, as is the ice cream menu.
Tea is a bit limited, but at least it's good (Tazo).
The selection of baked goods is very small for a coffee shop - at the moment only carrot cake, two muffins, and one kind of cookie.
But the pumpkin muffin I ate was delicious - and served warm with real butter!
There's plenty of seating, including a beautiful back yard, and the counter staff were friendly, quick and helpful.
They were even attentive to the kids who were asking about the goldfish on the counter and not buying anything.
It's pretty far from home for me, so I'll never be a regular, but I'll definitely be back.

Just had lunch there.
This place is wonderful.
The owners are very friendly and always chatty.
The food has always been exceptional, especially their soups!
Will definitely keep going back.

Great place to eat lunch and get a cup of coffee or ice cream.
Kid friendly with a couple of high chairs available.
Always friendly and always good.
Great place to stop in if you are in McFarland.
