Beautiful ambiance & seating.
Same great coffee.

Average Starbucks.
Slow drive-thru and needed me to repeat my order three times.

Can't live without coffee from Starbucks .. Long lines but service is fast

Watch how they ring you up - they rang me up for a black tea lemonade when I ordered just black tea.
The clerk claimed it was because I asked for a splash of flavoring (not even a pump of syrup).
2 drinks + small food items was $20.
Bad service and rude employee.
The employee who made my drink did add the flavoring for me which was nice.
Aria - these employees need to be trained up to meet your service levels that I have learned to expect.
