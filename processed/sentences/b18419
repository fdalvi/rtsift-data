Nothing special.
Your average fast food joint with a slight island flair - rice, pineapple, etc I had Pineapple BBQ Chicken and it was alright, but there was not a drop of BBQ or any other kind of sauce on the plate.
Kind of strange.
Anyhow, its nothing special if you ask me.
But if you passing by and hungry its worth pulling over.
"Its alright"  Eugene

Clean, fun menu authentic menu and plenty of choices.
The first thing I noticed when walking in was how modern, open and clean the restaurant is.
The menu is easy to read and includes some pictures as well.
The restaurant uses the basic "plate meal" concept often found in Hawaii which simply means you have your entree plus two sides.
This is not traditional American BBQ so don't walk in with this expectation.
The menu, like Hawaii, is a fusion of several Asian cuisines as well as unique Hawaiian items like their Spam appetizer with rice and seaweed.
I also recommend the "seaweed salad" for something different.
It's very refreshing and delicious.
I've had a couple of meals there and also enjoyed the crisp fried mahi mahi and BBQ chicken.
The prices are reasonable but slightly higher than your average fast food joint with good reason in my opinion.
Try it for yourself.

All pau now.
Out of business.
The food was pretty good, but it was nice to have a place so close to work.
