This place terrifies me.
When moving into the neighbourhood, we stopped for a drink in here while waiting for the landlord to turn up with the keys.
The staff were friendly enough, but this is one of those bars that when you walk in everyone turns silent and looks at you.
It is at that point you know this place is not for you.
But lets face it, you aren't going to be down this end of town unless you are a local and you are going to be able to suss this place out.
It is the definition of a dive bar, dated and hideous decor completes the look.
I am sure this place is great for the regulars, but for anyone else... keep walking.

I agree with everything Amy says, but I'm going to add one more little thing.
Try the food, its very nice.
I was surprised as hell when I sat down for lunch one day, I was too hungry to move so I decided to through caution to the wind for the sake of Yelp.
The things I do for you!
