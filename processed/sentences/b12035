If you were lucky enough to see their show before Roy was tragically mauled on stage by one of his famous white tigers, you know what an amazing experience it was.
My own experience was enhanced by the fact that we somehow scored seats in the front row, right under the elephant's ass when it appeared out of nowhere in front of us.
Unbelievable.
How'd they do that?
You can still hang with the famous felines and even meet the duo with a trip to their Secret Garden at the Mirage Hotel.

When you grow up in Las Vegas, Siegfried and Roy is an example of where you might go on the night of your junior prom (in the late 90's.
) Or was that just me and my gay best friend?

I saw this show as a kid...it was amazing.
I really miss this show as I believe it was THE show in Vegas.
I'm glad Cirque Du Solei is working with Criss Angel on a new illusionist show which I hope will bring back a new great illusionist show to Vegas.

First show I saw on my first trip in Vegas.
It was cool.
Sad what happened though!
