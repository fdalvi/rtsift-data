Absolutely a joy from start to finish.
I have had many dogs groomed over the years with various groomers and my experience at Margo's was by far the best.
Margo is efficient, professional, knowledgeable, kind, gentle, and my bushy haired border collie dog looks AH-MAZ-ING!
The store is clean and fresh smelling.
Margo's husband also works at the store and is an excellent 'receptionist'.
I couldn't be happier and I will definitely go back!

Margo is so good with our sweet Sophie.
She has groomed her twice and we are very pleased with the results.
Margo has notes of how Sophie is groomed and our likes/dislikes.
I highly recommend her!

I took my two Golden Retrievers in for a close shave and baths and Margo's did an excellent job!
Their coat is smooth, soft and just the right length.
I really like the open feel of the shop...the staff was also very friendly.
