I'm very impressed with Hawkins, Boley, and Aldabbagh!
They handled my speeding ticket extremely well.
They informed me of their plan to resolve the issue and I was kept up to date the entire time.
Whenever I call, they are very friendly and knowledgeable.
I would definitely recommend this law firm to anyone in need of legal advice or legal action.

I came in with a few tickets that I needed taken care of ASAP.
The staff was very understanding of my urgency and was able to get me taken care of quickly and professionally.
Everything was solved with the best possible results and the staff really made me feel like a valued client.
I will definitely be recommending them to friends,  family, and anyone else who needs legal help!
Thank you!

What really sets this firm apart is that they are very approachable and accessible, not like those OTHER law firms where you are the endless mercy of some legal assistant.
These guys know what they're doing and will deal straight with you.
Their fees were market rate or better as well!
