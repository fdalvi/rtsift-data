OK, I understand people in this line of business don't like to give quotes over the phone, but I was surprised when NONE, ZERO, etc of the first seven calls I made wouldn't give me even a max cost based on a worst case scenario quote.
The next four wanted me to schedule an in home estimate appointment, but for the next week.
UNTIL I called Solar Screens & More and talked to Amy.
She -did- give me a worst  case scenario quote over the phone, one I could have lived with.
And, it just so happened that Rob (the owner) was in my area on another job and could give me an estimate.
He arrived within an hour with samples, options, etc.
No pressure, no upsell, no trash talking or negartivity about competitors [I HATE THAT!].
Installatio day  [earlier today], he and helper apologized for arriving 20 minutes early, LOL.
They washed the windows before installing.
After they finished installing, they cleaned up the site, checking for dropped screws, etc.
They even put the removed regular screens away for me.
All in all, as pleasant and annoyance free proceess as I could imagine.

These guys are professional, quick and friendly too.
The materials are good quality and it only took a week to have them made and installed.
I only needed two screens for the front of the house and it looks great with the new screens!
Thanks guys!
