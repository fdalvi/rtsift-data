I almost hate when service is this good because they've basically earned my business for years.
The suits are excellent.
I was pleasantly surprised.
Definitely best place in the valley for a suit.
Tons of great options.
Shirts are a 4.5 out of 5.
If you're a fat dude these won't work.
They haven't started their bespoke suits and shirts yet but I'm looking forward to those.
The ties and shoes are good but not their bread and butter.
There was a tall blonde dude who was very knowledgable, personable and friendly.
I've been desperately looking for a place to get suits since moving from the east coast and I've found it.
I gave this place no shot to live up to the hype but it did.
If you're a guy who wants a good price for high quality slim fitting shirts and suits save yourself the aggravation and just go here.
It's hidden up the escalator by Tanzy.
Basically above Lululemon.

Woah!
This place is awesome, and sooo big!
Service is 5 out of 5 without a doubt!
The qualtity of just about all of their product does not match their great prices.
I have paid double and sometimes triple for similar pieces in other stores.
They are kind of hidden in Scottsdale Quarters upstairs next to Tanzy and iPic, so don't give up when looking for them!
When I was in there and a tall guy with brown hair (Marisio) and a tall blonde guy (Travis) were running around helping everyone and even though they were busy, everyone was perfectly taken care of, including myself.
5 of out 5 yelpers!

Great service and great prices.
Just happened to see this store when headed to the movies.
Glad to see a high quality yet affordable men's store open here.
Definitely recommend this store for a new suit.
The staff are knowledgeable and the tailor works right out in the open.
Cool concept!
