Other than the slightly strange location (in an office building, so you're occasionally riding up to your OB/GYN appointment with a bunch of twentysomethings coming back from their lunch breaks), this office is gorgeous.
Beautiful, new, lovely view.
And most importantly, an experienced, knowledgeable, friendly group of female RN's and physicians dedicated to women's health.
Every experience I've had here, from appointments to lab work, has been positive.

Great doctors, not so great nurses.
Doctors are great at actually listening to patients and helping keep me healthy.
The receptionists are also very kind and helpful.
Most of the nurses I've dealt with are extremely rude and careless.
If it weren't for the rude nursing staff I would've given 5 stars.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!
My first visit to this place today.
The doctor, nurses, receptionists, lab people all were incredible!
Super friendly, helpful and caring.
No waiting whatsoever.
Very high tech with their medical records and lab results available online.
Also, this was practically the nicest building I've ever been in.
There is a fireplace in the waiting room, for example.
