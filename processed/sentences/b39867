The absolute worst Steinberg I've been to yet!!
And that's saying something.
Staff is difficult and rude!!
First and last visit to this location.

I absolutely agree!!!!
This staff need to be trained in compassion and customer service.
This location needs a total overhaul  of its staff!!!!!!!
THE WORST!!!!!

No issues here - I was in and out in an hour for an MRI.
The staff was friendly and efficient.
Only disappointment was that I didn't get to choose the radio station while in the machine.

The staff is friendly and efficient, and for that I gave a star.
I cannot award a higher rating because I find it extremely degrading that ultrasound patients have to disrobe and wait in a waiting area in hospital gowns, rather than just change in the ultrasound room.
Having a pelvic ultrasound is already unnerving and embarrassing.
I would gladly give a higher star rating if I was allowed to keep a shred of dignity.
As I mentioned, the staff is excellent, it's this changing policy that needs to go.
