Each room in this luxury country house hotel has a very different character, and all are very luxurious, almost to the point of being over the top.
You'll feel very pampered after a stay here.
The staff are very helpful and attentive, without ever being too 'in your face'.
The hotel restaurant, 'Rhubarb' is very glamorous.
The service is excellent and the food wonderful.
