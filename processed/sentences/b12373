Great place for mid-century/mod furniture.
Get yer Eames, McCobb, Nelson, and more unusual suspects here.
Doug, the owner, is charming and super-knowledgeable.
I think it's only open Friday to Sunday.
Or is it Thursday to Saturday?
Call ahead.

I visit DA's Modern everytime I am in PHX.
Doug has a great eye for quality vintage modern and it shows.
If you're into modern this is one place that should be on your list!

If you are into Modernism, you have to check this place out.
The owner is super friendly and very knowable about modern furniture.
You can buy real deal vintage stuff here.
The store is small but inventory is constantly on the move.
I would like to decorate my whole house with stuff from this store.

Doug has a great eye for timeless mid century furnishings, art and pottery.
Doug's store resembles a little jewelry box filled with vintage Dunbar and Herman Miller furniture, Fantoni pottery, Blenko glassware, cool 50's art...Doug is THE resource in Phoenix for reasonably priced, high quality mid-century design!

I echo the other reviews - great place with a small but well-chosen selection.
The guy (Doug) who runs it is very friendly and knowledgeable about midcentury modern decor.
Unfortunately, this location will be closing soon.
I'm hoping he opens another local shop sometime soon, since it was great having this little slice of Palm Springs retro sophistication in Central Phoenix.

Out of business.
