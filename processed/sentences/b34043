Man how  I wish this places existed during my years in Waterloo.
Chinese crepe(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOcmUl8c7Sc), in Waterloo?
Not in my wildest dream would I imagine something THAT crazy (and sweet).
For those of you who don't know, Chinese crepe aka Jian Bing, is a type of street breakfast food in Northern China.
It's one of the most down to earth food that everyone loves.
The full experience includes: 1)placing the order by specifying the following: One or two eggs?
Spicy?
Sausage?
Crispy?
2) watching the person make it right in front of you (see the youtube video) 3) holding it with some sketchy looking brown wrap paper and feeling happy on a freezing morning.
Okay the crepes here are not quite as nice, but it's a decent replacement.
Besides the crepes, they also have soy milk, beef noodle soup, ji dan guan bing, rou jia mo, lamb skewer and much more.
During my brief stay here in Waterloo I visited this place 3 times, and everything I tried was pretty good (and cheap).
This place is located at where Iron Chef used to be in UW plaza.
Even though I was quite a fan of the good old Iron Chef, the opening of this place is probably the most exciting thing that happened in UW plaza for me.

Amazing!
The food here is so authentic!
All of the taste of street food in China but none of the sickness that comes with eating Chinese street food.
It's also quite cheap, $3.75 for a jianbing?
Wow!

I will so go to this restaurant again.
Now with a location in UW plaza, Sogo hits the spot when the stomach rumbles for northern Chinese cuisine.
The menu includes specialties from Tianjin like crepe and cold rice noodles.
The skewered lamb is juicy and spicy, just like I remember it in Beijing.
Enjoy a fresh hot cup of soy and fill your stomach for under $10.
Next time, I'll try the haggis soup.

oops reviewed the wrong branch.
Still good though!
