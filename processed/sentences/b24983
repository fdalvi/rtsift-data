Great "small town" feel of the bank.
Have always had good service with a smile.

Beware!
Their fee structure is worse than BofA.
I have almost 500 dollars in overdraft fees on about 500 dollars in overdraft.
I asked for my money on the spot but they want to talk to the branch manager to see if they will back out the fees.
If they don't I'm closing out all my accounts and moving (ick) back to BofA.
TCF will claim they are lower on fees but don't believe it.
I've now paid more in 6 days than I did in an entire year at BofA with ALL of their bank charges.
If you are looking for better bank, keep looking.

I usually would never Yelp about a bank but I feel I had to.
First off, I currently bank at 3 different places and TCF has been the best by far.
Marissa helped me open my checking and savings account.
She was so helpful and friendly.
I would give it 5 stars but I think they could be a little quicker at the window.
However it is better some days than others.
Staff is always helpful and  courteous.
I like how TCF allows their customers to deposit money and avoid an overdraft fee if it is done on the same day.
Very nice!!
Will continue to bank here.

TCF bank is worse than BofA in charges and caring for their customers.
We dipped below 0 for 3 days and they hit us with 39 dollars per overdraft transaction.
Even for charges as low as 2 dollars they hit us with 39 dollars in fees to "cover the charge".
The bank manager is just as uncaring as anyone I've ever spoken to at BofA.
I really wanted to like this bank too.
We had 480 dollars in overdraft fees in 2 days and the bank manager wouldn't budge on removing they fees even though we had over 10K in their bank.
After the bank manager refused to help us we withdrew our 4 accounts with them.
They are horrible.
If you are looking for a better bank keep looking.
I wish I would have.
We are still looking for a better bank.
