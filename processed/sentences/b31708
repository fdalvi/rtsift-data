Never, ever go here.
Stopped for gas and decided to give the chicken a try.
Bad signs from the beginning.
Empty.
Corn on the cob FRIED along with everything else but hey how could they ruin chicken strips and fries?
Hopped in the car and started to eat on the road.
Raised chicken to eat and it STUNK!
Had to throw everything away and stop for fast food again at a different business.
I think they have been frying everything in the same grease for years and never ever changing it.
YUCK!

Ate there today...it was awful...couldn't believe it,never again.

After reading the below reviews, my expectations were low for the quality of chicken and atmosphere.
Once I entered the truck stop where Chester's is located, I was pretty impressed.
The dining area was clean and the staff was friendly.
I ordered the number 2 ( 4 chicken strip combo) with a side of macaroni and biscuit.
The chicken itself was so-so, not a whole lot of flavor.
Dipping it in some BBQ sauce help liven them up.
Macaroni started off good, but after a few bites, didn't settle well.
The biscuit by far was my biggest let down.
Very dry, definitely needed some gravy.
I tried my compadres potato wedge and that was pretty bland as well.
Overall, the food was fresh, but lacked any substantial flavor.
Be sure to add sauces to your order to avoid my same experience.
I did enjoy their mascot Chester, it seemed like he enjoys himself when he snacks on the menu items.
Also, there were showers available after you ate.
