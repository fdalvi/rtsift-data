I am an aspiring model and radio personality in Scottsdale.
I completely recommend Terri's services for any occasion from weddings to photoshoots.
She has giving the look I wanted and felt good in for two of my photoshoots now.
She really cares and stresses enhancing your features through her MUA.
I love her and will be using her again for my next shoot!!

Terri, owner of Paradox Makeup Artistry & Aesthetics, is an amazing artist.
Every look is flawless, she really takes into account the client's facial shape and individual details to plan out the perfect makeover and then takes her time to be sure everything is on-point.
Terri really listens to her client's desires and her bombshell makeovers are beyond astounding.
She worked with me at an event this past weekend and not only did I get to see her amazing artistry on dozens of clients but I myself got a bombshell makeover.
She is a whiz at eyebrows and contouring!
I got more compliments that day than I ever have.
She's a professional through and through and a sweetheart too.
I would not hesitate to hire her in the future and I highly recommend her.

Terri, the proprietor of Paradox has been doing my eyelash extensions and fills for some time now.
She is very professional and does an amazing job.
She enhanced my eyes beautifully and I have had lots of compliments.
Terri has a gentle touch which is important especially when working on someones eyes.
I could not be happier and would HIGHLY recommend Paradox to anyone wanting fabulous eyelashes.
I love mine and you will too.
Simply the best!
You will not be disappointed.
