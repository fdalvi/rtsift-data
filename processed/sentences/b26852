Great place to go!
Been going for years free balancing and rotation with the tire and rim purchase!
3 yrs later and I STILL get compliments!

Amazing service.
I know I was very particular about my car.
Took a few days to get things just right but they got the job done with a smile.
I totally recommend this place to anyone in need of rims and tires.
My #1!!!
Thanks Janet!

Thanks to Mike for an amazing service!
The process was easy and fast!!
I would recommend them to anyone!!!

Do not buy from here!!
I bought a set of tires and rims from this place and they claimed to have a warranty.
Not even 9 months later all 4 of my sidewalls are cracked!
They said they would send them to the manufacturer, but the most they have ever given someone was $120.00 for a credit for all 4 tires.
They now want another $600 for more tires.
What a rip off!

I have been coming here for my wheel and tire needs for 2 years and Janet makes it so easy to keep coming back all of her help and recommondations have been perfect I have purchased wheels and tires for 4 different vehicles and she always makes sure everything is great.
If you want great customer service with a SMILE come see these guys !
