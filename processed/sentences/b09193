BE CAREFUL!!!!
Even though you are walking into a Lens Crafters store to get treatment from Dr. Irene, you are not dealing with Lens Crafters.
I went to Dr. Irene's office to get contact lenses, and I was told on the telephone that it would only cost me $15 for the exam (my insurance co-payment).
But it turns out that you have to spend an additional $60 to get a prescription!
This is a RIP OFF!
Why would my insurance pay for an exam that doesn't include a prescription?!?
The doctor was nice, I guess...but I couldn't think of anything else except for the way I was getting ripped off.
It would be MUCH CHEAPER to go to an optometrist that wasn't located in a mall.
Seriously.

This place was just fine, as far as optometrists go.
The receptionists and assistants were friendly, and the Dr was nice.
In and out promptly with a prescription for only my $20 co-pay.
No insurance hassle, or up-sell for glasses at Lenscrafters.

I've been going here for 3 years now.
Never had any complaints and they are always fast and to the point.
Great place!
