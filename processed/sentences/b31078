Saw Kristy's review and i've been on a hot dog tear lately so i figured even with crappy one star review let me try it out anyways.
Got a chocolate malt, a manhattan ( ?
) - chili, cheese, mustard and onions ( or was it a brooklyn ?
) fries and onion rings.
Total cost $10.56  The highlight ...not many ...fries were decent.
Onion rings - very good.
lows - the hot dog was somewhat boring - chili is ok;  The malt is disappointing in that the malt was clumped into lil mini malt balls - which meant a large portion of the malt was more of a shake.
I did the drive thru - the place is smaller in size then Sammy's   I won't return.
photos included

Ate here on Saturday.
I wonder if this is the first go at a restaurant for this owner.
If so, I'd love to talk to them and tell them the mistakes I think they are making based on my personal experiences.
The links themselves were good, but the polish was only so-so.
The buns got soggy and they really seemed like the basic hot dog bun you get at the store.
Find a local baker to make you some premium buns.
You are charging a premium price so don't cheap out.
The auto fry is only good for the occasional batch, the fries were crispy, but the rings were undercooked.
They probably would have been great had the oil been at frying temp.
It would be nice If there was some place to sit.
Convince the landlord to let you take up a couple spaces and put in a patio.
Maybe these are just growing pains.
I will try this place again in a few months, but right now Sonic has a better New York and Chicago dog.
That being said, I am rooting for you guys to succeed.
