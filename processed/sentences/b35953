This place should seriously get more coverage.
Maybe its because its a euro style salon complex with about 25 mini salons?
Either way I'm surprised that this place and Lea Lee my stylist was kept a secret for so long.
A friend referred me to Lea and she got me a pretty awesome cut for $15 (+$5 tip)  I'm very very happy to finally have found that someone in the vicinity of Phoenix can cut asian hair.
Talking with Lea apparently there's a lot of Korean and Chinese hair stylists in the area but when I looked them up they didn't seem to be on Yelp or Google :'(  Guess I can start a trend and find these peeps

I am writing this specifically about the facility ('cause I love, love my hair stylist).
I have been coming here about every 3 weeks for the past year and it is clear that the owners spend as little as possible on maintaining this place.
The bathroom is constantly out of paper towels, toilet seat covers and/or TP.
When they do have the paper products, they are sitting on the counter/toilet vs. being in their holder.
Today they have a roll of TP on the counter as they are out of paper towels.
The toilet needs cleaning and I will save the description of the nasty toilet brush near by.
They say they offer wireless but that has only worked a couple of times in the past year that I have been there.
I understand they finally got a new router but since I am writing this from the Salon and the internet has been down more than up, I don't think they've done anything.
So much for that.
Since I now know what they charge the hairdressers...good grief!
They surely can provide better maintenance for their customers.
