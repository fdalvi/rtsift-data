Was looking for something a little more healthy than Carl's Jr or Burger King and didn't feel like spending an arm and a leg for the other restaurants in the airport so I decided to eat here.
Food was good and they have a nice selection.
I went with one of their grilled mozz and chicken sandwich and it wasn't too bad.
I agree with the other reviewer that service is on the slow side and they didn't seem to know who was first in line since they helped someone who cut in front of me and even watched him do it LOL.
All in all I had a good and healthier-side sandwich so it worked out.
A-OK pretty much sums it up here.

The low rate is primarily for the service.
4 employees wandering around behind the counter yawning while acting like the customer (me, being the only customer in sight) is interrupting them.
Every table top was dirty, no customers sitting down, just empty dirty tables.
The food was average, but slightly better than the usual airport meal.

The food was lousy.
The cheese pizza was greasy and bland.
It reminded me of pizza at the cafeteria when I was in college.
The lime chicken sandwich that my wife ordered was also less than stellar.
The service was slow, and they already had run out of several sandwiches on the menu, even though we ordered around 1pm.

DO NOT GO HERE!!!.
you'll need a second mortgage.
2 toasted sandwiches.
a bag of chips and 2 drinks.
$33, and they don't even have a tray for me to carry it on.
Clear your own table before you sit down!!!!
I don't care that the high price is caused by the 'cost of their rent'.
Absolute extortion.
Avoid at all costs.
Staff didn't really care either.
In fact, when I complained about the costs she said, 'yeah, I get that everyday'!
