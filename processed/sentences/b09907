If you want the best of the best, here is where it is at.
These guys did my security system but not only that would provide services such as coming by my place when I am out of town for extended periods of time to use the plumbing and such and keep the house in good working order.
They do security but so much more when it comes to service.

THANK YOU SafeGaurd!
Always willing to discuss with us what options we have, and to keep us safe at night!
TOP NOTCH!

Matt Moorhead and Safeguard Security are just awesome!
Several years ago Matt replaced my previous ADT Security System with a Safeguard Security System for my home and my wife and I have been so happy with it.
My payments are less and the security coverage is better, you can't beat that!
My wife and I feel so comfortable with Safeguard protecting our home, it's just really a nice feeling.
I recommend Matt and Safegaurd Security to all of my customers when I start their homeowners insurance policies for them or during our annual review of them.
Having a Safeguard Security system is not only a smart thing to do, but it will also save you a lot of money on your homeowners insurance policy through the home alarm discount.
Call Safeguard today and ask for Matt Moorhead, there's no one better in the home security business!

Do not use this company if you can avoid it.
We contracted with them to monitor several industrial buildings and when we sold one of them, they held us over a barrel to buy out their equipment (after we had paid WELL over the value).
Read your lease carefully with these people.
