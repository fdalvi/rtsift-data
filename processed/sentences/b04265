I always feel like I am in a cafeteria when I'm at a Boston Market, but this one?
It makes me feel like I'm in a cafeteria... a sanitarium cafeteria.
The place was gross.
Not sanitary.
Food was old and gray.
The place creeped me out.
Big thumbs down

Went here with 2 co-workers.
Not too busy of time of day.
They gave us 2 meals.
Obviously, we ordered 3.
They actually tried to briefly argue that they gave us all our meals.
Seriously?
3 sitting at the table with 2 meals.
2+2 equals.....?
Food was good though.

This is actually a really good Boston Market if you ask me.
I have found the customer service to be excellent and well above my expectations on more than one occasion.
One young gentleman named Trevor was very helpful and gave us some great information about catering for a special event one of the times we went.
He checked in on us to see how the food was and cleared our table and made sure we had everything we needed.
I was quite impressed!
The food is also always really good at Boston Market.
The brownies are addictive!
I love how the fountain coke always tastes really good here and better than it does at other quick restaurants.
I also like their drink cups a lot!

Nice location.
Food is good.
I like getting the side meal when I can;t think of where to eat.
My baby loves the mac and cheese here.
Staff is nice.
Store is clean.

Just went thru the drive thru.
All I needed was some red potatoes to take to a family lunch.
They told me it would be about 5 minutes.
It was actually almost 10 but the manager personally walked out the potatoes to me, apologized, and gave me an order of brownies.
she said "please take these on us and enjoy them wherever you are headed to" AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE

This place is BAD..... they dont know how to cut up there meat well all of the meat has the extra fat and nastiness that you dont want to eat i would NEVER.
Advise any of you to go here i dont want to go there again myself.
