Stayed here for a month in 2012.
Very friendly staff, clean gated property & close to the strip, across the street from UNLV & the hard rock.
Will be back.

Lived here for 5 months when I first moved to Las Vegas.
I knew I was over-paying, but this was a great place to help with getting settled in Las Vegas.
Can pay by the week or month.
Moved here with no furniture, so having a fully furnished studio apartment was nice.
Property is well managed.
It is in an excellent location if wanting to be close to The Strip, but not on The Strip.
Also close to UNLV.
One thing to know is the airplanes get quite loud.
Right in flight path for McCarran(sp?
), but kind of get used to this.
If looking for a place to help get situated when moving to Vegas, or a place if here for 1-2 weeks on business or pleasure, I highly recommend Holiday Royale.
All utilities included, plus Wi-Fi and Satellite TV.
24 hour security, plenty of parking, on bus line and many more features.

i am from brazil and arrived in the us today to scout properties to place my vip customers as i represent a network of tourism agencies in sao paulo.
i needed housing assistance for multiple brazilian vip families and a helpful and polite secretary transferred me to a very angry, obnoxious, rude and "too good for you" lady named kathy (?
) whom was nothing but very aggressive towards me, heard nothing i had to say and probably mistaken me with some marketing someone.
i have been to usa multiple times over the past 10 years  and unfortunately had the displeasure of having kathy on the phone.
i will never do business with this company, specially placing my vip customers on their hands as don't see the staff as being  fit to even handle my dog.
terrible experience!
ps: kathy, you should most definitely not handle the public!
(and thanks for such warm welcoming to your country!
