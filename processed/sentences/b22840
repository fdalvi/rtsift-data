A nice place to grab a coffee and a treat and do geeking on the internet.
A great drive-thru option if you can't stay.
Megan, the manager, has staffed enough folks behind the counter now to wait on the drive-thru and walkins.
They even bring you your order if they can!
Also they have a foursquare Mayor contest.
Large place indoors and out, cool artwork on the walls, free wi-fi (ask for the password slip when you order) and good background music!

I spend a lot of time here as a remote office.
Meghan, the proprietor, is *always* very welcoming and warm.
She remembers my standard order, and does not seem to mind that I spend a lot of time working out of her establishment.
The varieties of coffee is good.
The pastries are good.
I have not tried one of their sandwiches yet.
I enjoy the "homey" atmosphere... puzzles, cards, and books.... for the clientele to enjoy.
I also enjoy supporting a "local" coffee house over a big chain.

The staff is very friendly.
I like that.
Love the current quiz question they have hanging right inside the door.
If you know the answer think your order is free.

I love their iced lattes.
The only thing I ask is that they add more "ICE" to the lattes.
Just a few cubes won't cut it, taste like a room temperature drink rather than something refreshing.
Then again, it's only one person who makes the drinks terrible there.
Everyone else is FANTASTIC!

Slowest drive thu e-v-e-r  I ordered an iced tea...one car in front of me.
12 minutes....  when i got to the window they had to ask me again what I ordered.
don't waste your time being stuck in the drive thru (one you're in, you can't escape!

Love the coffee not thrilled about my service.
Of the 4-3 times I have been in the barista has never been behind the counter ready to serve me.
Every time that I have walked in they follow me off the patio where they have been smoking.
I know that you are entitled to a break but, sitting out chit chatting with your friends smoking is not what you get paid for.
Either I have bad timing coming in when they are on break or the kids there are huge slackers.

Service is slow, drinks are nothing to write home about.
I wanted this place to be so much more but it fell short.
I always want to try to try out coffee and drinks from other locations besides Starbucks, but it seems this place is just missing the mark.
