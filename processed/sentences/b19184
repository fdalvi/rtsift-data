This place is great.
Second time there on Tuesday night.
Came in around 10:30 PM & they close at 11.
$14.99 per person I believe & I think it was the manager in blue was SO nice.
Gave us free drinks!
The bus boy on the other hand was so rude.
Threw the straws for our drinks on the table & went off.
Never once did he crack a smile.
The food was good considering the fact that they were about to close so a lot of it was put away.
Four stars for the food & the guy in the blue shirt  for his great vibe & still letting us in to eat !

Went by reviews on Yelp and this place was not good at all.
The lunch special had no different price and two of the buffet table were empty!
Food was bland and not much variety!
Try something else before going here.

we went pretty late, but come on it was right on the strip over half the food was gone..empty trays, not being refilled what was there was from like 53 BC and starting to crust over asked waitress 3 times for a refill of my drink and she said okay  3 times but just continued talking to another waiter, never even got  it, i had to get up and go to the front counter and ask someone to do it myself....waitress was seriously retarded.
chop sticks?
not a chance  i'm an easy rater on here, and i like cheap buffets but this shit was WACK

Buffet for dirt cheap.
What more can I say?
You get what you paid for.

Food editable but not much else.
Will not be back.
Weird smell it place too..
