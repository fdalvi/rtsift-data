Don't go in the Drive Thru if there are more than 3 cars.
You will sit there for 20 minutes.

Lifetime favorite.
Restaurant was recently renovated,  added more seating, and updated decor.

Love me some A&W.
Best fast food out there and there needs to be more of them!

This location always prepares everything well, fresh, fast, and they are friendly.
I visit here from work in Sun Prairie, maybe once every couple of weeks.
My normal selection is the Coney Dog Combo but with cheese curds.
Kind of on the expensive side (give the cheese curds substitution), at $8.00 and some change, but a nice alternative from the same old crap.
The cheese curds are awesome.
They are soft and have a light coating of breading (probably just flour), compared to Culver's, which is more breading than crust, and normally not even melted.
I'd recommend going here if in the area and in the mood for some better fast food.
