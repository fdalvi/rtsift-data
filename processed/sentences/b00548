Everyone here is so nice, caring and professional.
If you have to have an outpatient surgery or procedure, this is a great place to go.

Had an outpatient knee arthroscopy here.
The experience was sufficient for the cost i incurred.
Nothing great.
The staff wasn't that courteous.

Just had a carpal tunnel release and some work on my elbow ulnar nerve by the amazing Dr. David Thull, (awesome doctor, brilliant surgeon and all around cool guy) at the Gateway Surgery Center.
The clerical staff was accommodating and professional, while the medical staff were amazing and fun.
They made feel totally at ease when I went to the back, I had been a little apprehensive, but hey I was going to be put under with a general anesthesia.
Everybody in surgery was awesome....and that's all I remember.
They helped me go from the gurney to the surgical tabled, made me comfortable, the anesthesiologist asked me where I grew up.
The next thing I remember is waking up in recovery.
It was a wonderful experience due to wonderful and dedicated professionals,  I'm so grateful for people who dedicate their lives to helping folks.
God bless em all!
What can I say, great place, but I' not in any hurry to go back
