Big City Bagels has excellent service and bagels to match.
Each week I order 3 dozen bagels and the staff is attentive to any special requests.
Thanks for the butter!

Awesome bagel place.
Fresh bagels with super friendly staff and a great bonus program: buy 9 breakfast omelette sandwiches get the 10th free!

Ever since visiting New York City and eating at Ess-a-Bagel I've been in search for an amazing everything bagel with lox here in Phoenix.
We stopped to grab a bagel here and the location is perfect, but parking is a bit of a pain in the rear.
It get's a little congested during peak hours.
We placed our order which was made fresh as we waited and we received it within 10 minutes.
The bagel was nicely toasted and it came in two halves instead of pressed together like a sandwich.
I didn't mind, but there could have been a little more cream cheese on it.
the bagel tasted great, but I do miss those NYC bagels.
I would come to Big City Bagels again to get my fix.

My most favorite bagel EVER is at Ess-a-Bagel in NYC.
Obviously, I can't run down the street and get one of those whenever I want, so I'm continuously on the hunt for a substitute here in Phoenix.
We decided to try Big City Bagels because it's close to our new house and I was hoping I'd finally find THE bagel.
While it was good, it was nowhere close to my favorite (alas, I will have to keep looking).
I did like that the bagels were small.
While some may not feel the same way, I feel like bagels are already filling so with a smaller bagel I can get just enough of a fix ;)    The lox tasted fresh, which is a good thing here in the desert, but the BEST thing about this place??
They have jalape√±o cream cheese!!!
Some bagel places have started carrying it, but not all, so I was happy to find another one that has it.
It's the BOMB.COM!
Parking is a little scarce because it's at the back side of a shopping center and it shares the lot with OH-SO, which always seems to be packed.
