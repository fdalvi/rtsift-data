Located in Terminal 4 of Sky Harbor Airport (just outside of security before heading down escalator to baggage claim) is a convenient place to stop when you get off of that early a.m. flight and had not yet had a bite to eat.
Bagels, spreads, breakfast and deli sandwiches.
While the service wasn't slooow, the people who work there are definitely confused.
I had to pay three separate times since they kept forgetting to ring items up.
Bagel.
Check.
Special spread, oh I didn't get that.
Check.
Bottle of water, you wanted that too?
Oh, now I ran out of dimes, I'll be right back (BTW, in case you didn't know, 2 nickles = 1 dime or 10 pennies = 1 dime).
After the morning, have them toast your bagel since it may be starting to get hard after sitting in the bins exposed to air for a few hours.

Horribly slow service here, except when the really tall guy is working.
Hummus was disgusting with huge chunks of chickpeas in it.
Any degree of complexity in the egg & cheese bagel order and they seem to manage to screw it up.
Who would have thought swiss is so complicated vs. american cheese?

I love Einstein Bros.
They are located right outside of TSA checkpoint A gates at Sky Harbor..once you get in thru security.. good luck finding anything half way healthy..
SO its this or its Paradise Bakery.. which I get bored with..Einstein has tasty bagels and schmear..but also a lighter version of sammys.
I like the turkey lightened sammy.
I get it often and I love it.
The bagel is more like half the size.
AND I think it's delish!
The people here are friendly.
Its airport pricing.. the only thing I dislike.

They had bagels and I needed something to eat early at the airport.
Not much to it beyond that.
I suppose I like their non-airport retail locations better, but what can you expect from the airport?

A great road stop.
consistent and tasty.
Coffee isn't too bad, though these are often situated next to (or within walking distance from) McDonalds.. er..
I mean Starbucks.

Closed.
Sad.
Replaced with ANOTHER Starbucks.... sigh.
