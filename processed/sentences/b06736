So I applied for a position on their website which I was over qualified, maybe even over qualified.
I go in and do an interview with one of them and answer a ton of questions and fill out countless amounts of paperwork.
I leave expecting to hear back on a position, but NO.
It's been a month and I've never heard back from them.
I'm a talented individual with a B.S.
in Applied Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science.
They never got back to me.
Worthless if you ask me, all recruiters are worthless, only looking out for themselves.
I got a position by myself eventually that fits my qualifications and salary expectations, not these worthless jobs they have to offer.
What a joke QTI is.
