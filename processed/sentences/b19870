A small, very welcoming hotel, the Howard is both friendly and elegant.
The rooms are lovely, the service is perfection itself.
Highest recommendation!

Afternoon tea is excellent.
I have had afternoon tea here on a number of occasions and it is a real treat.
The service and ambiance are just wonderful, the tea menu extensive.
I have always stuck to the Howard Afternoon blend.
The food consists of sandwiches, scones, cakes all home made, all delicately served but very filling.
I miss lunch and dinner when I have afternoon tea.
I would recommend this for adults who appreciate the Georgian surroundings, a very quiet atmosphere and good home made food.

Room: Amazing.
Service: Pretty good.
Sound level: Pretty quiet.
Price: SUPER REASONABLE.
I decided to get away for the weekend and turned to Edinburgh for my adventuring.
A few quick clicks on Booking.com made me realize something: I could just a star or two in a hotel rating by just being a mile outside of Old Town.
SOLD!
The room I booked was the Luxury Double (see: pictures) and the room was named the Ravelston.
Second floor room and rear-facing for extra-quiet abilities (aside from the squeaky floor).
The Howard has a Butler service and two of the three I was quite happy with; they were friendly, helpful and useful.
The room service is incredibly reasonable: you want tea?
They bring a fresh pot at no charge.
Want to order from their menu?
It costs as much as any cafe you could venture to.
And, with any room booked it came with breakfast- so there's that.
I feel like The Howard won 4-4.25 stars from me.
I was happy, comfortable, relaxed and they accommodated quite well to my antisocial tendencies.
So, what are they missing?
I think the food is a bit under par to be considered 5-star as are their drinks.
This place was quite lovely, I would definitely consider booking again.
