Awesome variety of health services and a great staff to top it off!

If I didn't have to make a star on here I wouldn't!
Worst place ever!
He spent most of his time talking about remodeling his office with some guy instead of getting people in!
I was there for 30 minutes and decided to leave.
I would never recommend anyone to come here.

Dr. Taylor was friendly and very attentive to our needs.
Would highly recommend his services!
