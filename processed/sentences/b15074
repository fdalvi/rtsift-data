Southwest deserves a five star raging because they consistently provide excellent customer service and do not charge it's customers baggage fee.
However, I give Phoenix airport a three star because the waiting area is small and has no electrical outlets.
In addition, the food choices are very limited.

Southwest Airlines...You will always be my first choice in air travel!
I flew with another airline to use up an existing ticket...but whenever possible, I'm sticking with Southwest!

I used to fly this airline every week!
I earned a Free Companion Pass for several years running.
I was a super fan.
But, they changed.
Big Time.
The "low fare" airline completely restructured its frequent flyer program so that they no longer reward you for flying frequently.They reward you for paying higher fares!
Yes, it really is that hypocritical.
Pay more and get more points.
Find and use low fares at the "low fare" airline and you are penalized severely.
The current frequent flyer program is worthless.
Programs like that are a real motivator to me and many other frequent flyers.
We are not going to pay more to deceive ourselves into thinking we are getting something "free.
"  Nor are we going to rip off our companies by intentionally paying higher fares just to qualify for perks we used to earn by virtue of flying all the time with SWA.
They've completely alienated me.
I no longer have any affinity whatsoever for this rip-off airline.
(And, by the way, check out their fares and compare.They frequently are the highest fare.
Hypocrites.
