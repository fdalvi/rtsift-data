Best barbershop in Phx

Fairly mediocre.
Whenever I went by, unless the specific barber that I normally go to, you're liable to sit around for a few hours until someone is able to help you.
Another person said it best, "I went to the "Barbershop" for a haircut, not the whole damned movie".
I discovered "Esquire" downtown and it's certainly a busy professional's barbershop so that's my new spot.
I can get a professional haircut in a reasonable period of time.

I  would have to say this shop has guys that give a good haircut.
My review would have been 5 stars but they lose a star for speed.
I  don't know if this is just how barbers cut in PHX but they are extremely slow while cutting your hair.
Maybe I  am just used to getting a cut back east.
Everytime I go the staff is welcoming and friendly,  I  would recommend to my friends.

I must say I was a little nervous going to this place.
First, I am a female getting and second I was concerned about the neighborhood.
Once I got over that, I will not go anywhere else.
I have been back 2 additional times since.
The neighborhood is not at all bad either.
You must know that you will be waiting a while to get in the chair.A least 30 min, so be prepared.
Once you are seen, the barber takes his time to get it perfect.
I have a unique hairstyle, kind of an alternative dreadlock Mohawk, with the sides shaved.
The barber used clippers, then did this lovely hot towel soothing thing,  then combed it to see how my hair laid down, then edged it up.
The prices are very reasonable too.

Great barbershop, great location, great ambiance!
Ian, my barber, always take care of me and cuts my hair with precision.
I wear my hair ultra short, and I can't take any chances with my hair,  so finding this spot was a blessing.
My barber gets me in and out, and that's very important to me.
