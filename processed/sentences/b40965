Lovelovelove the permanent eyeliner I had done by Britney!
Came out beautiful first time around, then with the free touch up 2 weeks later, I couldn't be more thrilled!!
I've had my eyeliner done before- years ago- and the experience was nowhere near the same!
The method Britney and her mom, Anita use is virtually painless compared to my last experience!
I had downtime after the previous treatment, but after Britney, I could go anywhere and do anything.
Didn't look or feel 'beat up' and swollen like the time before.
They share their office, which has a great atmosphere.
It is a beautiful space,  and they have a respectful, loving rapport with eachother.
I would highly recommend them to anybody!

Anita es the best make up artist that I have meet, she is nice, patient, lay back and have a very good customer service.
Her work is well done.
The only one that I would ever go with.

The best in town.
I have had Anita Smith do my lips, brows, and eyeliner since I moved here 11 years ago.
It's so natural, no one ever guesses that I had "help" looking good.
Anita is passionate about her work in every way and is constantly educating and seeing the best in products.
You cannot find anyone better.
