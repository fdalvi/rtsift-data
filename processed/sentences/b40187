Wow!
Jennifer does amazing color!!!!
My hair is impossible to color, the color never stay's so it seemed like it was always a waist of money!
Jen said "give me a shot.
.. you'll be happy!
" THAT was an understatement!
My hair is amazing!
Thanks Jen!!
I send everyone I know to you!

Originally created a yelp account so I could put a crappy business on blast but I love my nail tech so much I had to sing her praises.
Here we go: since the first time I had my nails done by Lauren, I haven't gone to anyone else.
She is a creative genius, through and through.
I hardly give Lauren any direction and she runs wild with beautiful and festive creations for both acrylics and gels.
It just doesn't get any better.
I highly recommend Lauren for all of your nail needs!

Jennifer does wonderful color and cuts.
I just wish I could take her with me to blow dry my hair.
She does excellent work!
