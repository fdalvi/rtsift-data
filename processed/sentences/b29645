Bad 2 the bone bail bonds in Las Vegas!

When I needed bailed out of jail, these guys were there!!!
No matter what the charge is!!!
And they are good friends of mine :)

I've never had to bail anyone out before, so I had to do some research when my friend texted me that she got a DUI.
I called this bonds place since they popped up with two good ratings on Yelp.
I talked to Elaine and she was very friendly and explained the process to me.
I just had to give my friend's last name to look up in the system.
I gave my card number over the phone to process the bond, and  Elaine called me back with updates and frequently checked on the status.
I had no idea what to expect when calling, but I'm really glad I had such a friendly representative to answer all my questions and explain everything (without judgment).
This will definitely be my go-to if I ever need to bail anyone out!

I haven't had to bail too many people out of jail in my life.
Maybe 2 or 3 which already seems like a lot in 1 lifetime.
When I recently needed to bail someone out of jail, I did as most would and Googled Bail Bonds, there are no shortages of bail bonds or their ads.
So I decided to look on Yelp and read the latest review which was a 5 star review.
After calling Hero Bail Bonds and dealing with Elaine, the same person mentioned in the review, I have to say Christina M.'s review was spot on.
I hope to never have to speak to Elaine again, but if I find myself in that position, Elaine at Hero Bail Bonds will be my first call.
She was a pleasure to deal with and made the entire process as easy as ordering a Pizza.
I also suspect that by dealing with Elaine, the person that I was bailing out, got out quicker?
Can't be sure thou.
Thanks Christina M. & Yelp & of Course, Elaine!

I was in Vegas a few months back and had to bail one of my friends out.
I called a different bail bonds and they were not able to help me because I was out of state but referred me to hero.
The guy was funny and a little weird in a good way tho lol he gave me and my gf these 3-4x shirts.
he made the whole process as enjoyable as possible.
If you need to bail someone out this is your spot.

I am a local who found Hero on this site and am very grateful that I did.
Johnny answered the phone and put me at ease right away.
He was helpful and nice, and helped me through every step of bailing my loved one out of jail.
I had never dealt with this before, and he had just the right approach, not judgmental, not intimidating, but thorough.
I can't tell you what I expected but I'll never forget how relieved I was to hear his voice every time we had the occasion to talk.
He's the guy you want on the other end of the line in this situation, end of story.
