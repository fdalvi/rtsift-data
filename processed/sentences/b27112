A great shopper is to shop around.
The price, services especially about quality.
When I lived in Henderson, NV area in 2005 to 2011, I found Sal's Taylor's and Dry Cleanse near to my house.
They had the best prices for dry cleaning & laundry.
If you want to do Taylor they do very excellence quality.
You can't find a mistake on your clothes.
I've been taking my clothes there for 6 years and I am constantly pleased with the good service, low prices and excellence quality.
Right I move to Santa Ana, CA but I still sent my nice clothes to do Taylor over there because I can't find one like them.
It a little price to send to them but I believe they do it right.
I will never do anywhere else because they always get my order right and take care of my clothes!

I really love this place!
She is do it a super nice and wonderful service.
I alway bring my clothes go to alteration and maintain even do wedding dress, suit...and also the bottom hem of the pant legs perfectly.
She did an excellent professional job.
Don't miss the right place!!
You will not be disappointed.

I was soo happy to find an alteration place that was up to the task of doing a very particular job.... Sewing up My couch cushion that my dogs tore up!
I was a little skeptical because I knew it was a big task..
But hey, it was a  2k couch and I wasn't really wanting to replace my whole couch over a torn cushion!
The nice lady gave me a very reasonable price, had it done super fast and made my couch cushion look like new!!!
Sewed up the teeth marks, sewed up the stuffing, put in a new zipper..
I'm not a seamstress but I'm sure it was no easy task!!
So to all u yelpers, if this lady can handle this task, I'm sure hemming ur clothes and dry cleaning will be a breeze!
