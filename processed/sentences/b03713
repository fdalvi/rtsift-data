After going to several Chiropractors without much help relieving my shoulder and knee pain issues, I am really glad that I finally found Dr. McCartney thanks to http://www.ratemds.com/ website.
There, you can see how great patients say about this Doctor.
And that is very true.
I have been seeing him 6 times since the last 3 months.
Every visit has been very effective.
Dr. McCartney has a very unique technique to find all problematic spots and treat them very effectively.
He explains to me where the souce of the pains was when he found them.
He tells me what I should expect from each treatment.
And he surprises me every time of how much he is right about it.
I love the way he is asking question, writing down all my complaints, writing down all treatments, and going though the list every visit to make sure he (and I) don't miss anything.
Dr. McCartney will absolutely be my Chiropractor from now on.
I recommend him to everyone who is still searching for a great Chriropractor.
Go see Dr. McCartney, and you won't be disappointed.

Dr. McCartney is an amazing chiropractor.
I have been his patient for 10 years and I don't have a single complaint.
He is gentle when adjusting, and he has been able to diagnose and successfully treat many of my ailments that regular MDs had no clue how to treat.
If you need an excellent chiropractor/Applied Kinesiologist in the Valley, here's your man!

Not only the best Chiropractor I have ever used, but also most knowledgeable doctor I have used.
I am an extremely active individual, resulting in many aches and pains.
Dr. McCartney has made it possible for me to maintain my active lifestyle.
He has also fixed many issues that have nagged me for years resulting in exponential growth in a competitive sport.
Not to mention his wife, who runs the office, is a sweatheart.
