One of the best vets I've ever taken any of my pets to see.
Don't expect a high end boutique vet experience because that's not what you'll get here.
What you'll get is a very knowledgeable and caring vet who takes the time to get to know his patients and their "parents" at a fair price.

I love Dr. Vitale, he is amazing with both of our dogs!!!!
Wonderful and friendly staff that are extremely helpful and knowledgeable.
Stayed after hours to help our dog, and goes above and beyond.
I recommend him to all my friends with dogs!

I've been going to the Sun Prairie Pet Clinic for 4 years now.
Dr. Vitale truly has a love for animals.
I have both a cat and dog.
Dr. Vitale takes his time with the animals, and answers all of my questions very thoroughly.
He knows that families are on a budget, he's very real and honest if he feels testing/surgery/medicine, etc needs to be done or if it could wait, or if other steps could be taken first.
I take my dog every 6 weeks or so in for a nail trim, Sue, one of the vet techs, is awesome.
I have also used a couple of the techs there for in home dog care when I'm out of town and have been very pleased.
I will continue to recommend this clinic to my friends.
