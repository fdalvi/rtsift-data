The Creative Quest is a terribly cute little store in old-town Glendale.
The shop sells all manner of handmade papers, rubber stamps, scrapbooking notions and book-binding supplies.
I originally found this store because it's a great place to buy origami paper.
They take the paper remnants and cut them into squares to be sold in bulk, variety bags.
It's an amazing deal for a collection of fine, textured paper.
Check out their website for the workshops going on each month!

How could you not like a paper art store in a little historic house in down town Glendale?
The biggest draw to Creative Quest is its wall of handmade papers.
It is the largest selection that I have found on the west side of town.
Creative Quest offers a changing supply of stamps, inks, books, and ephemera.
Items usually cost about $.25 more per item than other retailers which can start to add up  if art is not your hobby but your addiction.

There aren't many rubber stamp/decorative paper stores left in this town.
Although this store is kind of small I love the selection that is  available.
It has come a long way from being Katie's Closet.
The staff is very friendly and helpful and the store is super cute.
So far the classes have been fun and interesting but then again they are showing you pretty cool projects.

I love the ambience of this place, it reeks of creativity...
The staff is friendly and down to earth... My favorite memories are taking classes there and  participating in the ATC's exchanges...Great place to drop into when you're in the area

The staff was friendly!!!
I do want to go back and take some classes here!

I was not very impressed with the customer service I rcvd today.
I called to see if they had a certain product and the lady who answered the phone seemed put out by having to take my call.
Personally she should have just let the answering machine pick up.
I was so caught off guard by her rudeness that I was at a loss for words and then she goes on to tell me that the store is closed until January of next year.
I don't think I will be stopping by to see the new store once it opens.
