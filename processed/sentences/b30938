Grace was very helpful in explaining my options.
Doug showed up on time and was clean and efficient in replacing my windshield.
I couldn't ask for better.

Windshield was replaced-short and sweet and to the point.
Cost $215 out of pocket.
I had a crack much larger than a dollar bill so my insurance wouldn't cover it and this place came to the rescue!

MDR  was terrific.
I had two cracked windsheilds in two weeks and they were quick and helped with the insurance claim.
