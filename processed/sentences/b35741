I used to come here all the time when I worked nearby.
Well I am back and nothing has changed but the menu.
They still gave my favorite gyro platter for lunch special.
I had the gyro sandwich it was very good VERY good.
Went back a few days later for the Gyro Platter and its exactly how i remember it.
Going back next weekend or the one after with the family to see how good it is for bringing Children

Whenever I am in the Phoenix area, I make sure this is one of my first places to eat.
The food is phenomenal and the service is nice and friendly.
They have a nice outdoor patio and plenty of seating inside as well.
Prices are reasonable and they have a variety of menu items.
The decor is a bit lacking but that doesn't make it or break it for me.
