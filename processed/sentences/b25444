So Dillards does not let girls try on dresses if they don't look like they are going to buy.
Which mommy and daddy might buy them.
What jerks.
Has no one ever seen Pretty Woman?
Big big mistake.

I'm starting to like this Dillard's more and more.
Nice staff, great designers, very clean, it's a great place to shop.
No one ever shops here, you can always get front row parking and the shoe department kept me occupied for an hour.
Both Dillard's and Macy's at San Tan mall seem to be mini-version department stores.
Macy's use to be my go to place but Dillard's is really growing on me.

MAC cosmetics department:  Not impressed.
I was making a large purchase and I was completely rushed by the associate "helping me".
It was not busy at all, so I don't see why I was rushed.
Unfortunately, this is the closest MAC to me.
Bummer.

The Santan mall location in Dillards is the ABSOLUTE worst store.
You could stand there with a clown suit and no one would even look your way.
Not once do they ask if you need help and most of the time you do since their products are in the cabinets for the color you need.
Also, I have gotten my makeup done there before and it looks terrible.
I could do my make up better with out a doubt!
!My biggest issue is it happens every single time I go there and this is the closest one to my house so of course I go there.
I will definitely NOT be returning to that location.
I stood there with my make up picked out ready to be rang up at the register for over 20 minutes and wasn't helped until I started walking away.
I did not make a purchase due to that.
I would not want that location getting my revenue as they do NOT deserve that at all.
TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE
