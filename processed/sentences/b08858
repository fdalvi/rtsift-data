nice selection, great prices on certain bottles but poor customer service - email promised tasting of Williams Selyem wines (which were priced incredibly low!
) but none were open and when asked the owner sneered he could only open so many bottles at a time, but he only had one other bottle open - and, even after spending nearly $165 dollars, no free glass was offered, again per the email

Small, but carefully selected wine selection.
This shop has excellent wines from napa at reasonable prices.
The owner of this shop offers advice in a friendly and helpful manner.
If you are in the area and want a wine to compliment any occasion, this shop won't disappoint!

Excellent selection.
I like the fact that the whole store is 64 degrees.
Can't imagine not buying a bottle of wine here!
Very knowledgeable staff.

was here in 2008   I had found a wine at the cave creek that I really liked but was in Scottsdale...
I thought it would be impossible for them to have it but they did!
staff was help full and also suggested a wine with a meal I was making so double win.

One of the worst customer service and BAD ATTITUDES I've ever experienced.
The owner is very UNFRIENDLY.
He treats you as if you have wandered uninvited into his shop.
I asked for a Joseph Phelp wine and his reply was "why would I have that here?!
"  I is as if he didn't want any business or customers at all.
The wine selection is average and over-priced.
THE ARE HUNDREDS OF BETTER WINE STORES nearby.

Great selection.
Where can you find Peter Michael in Arizona, you can here.
Additionally hard to find California,Italian, French and Spanish elections.
No one in Arizona has a better establishment.
