This is a great neighborhood (though we really don't live that close) flower shop.
My sister started going here years & years ago.
Then I think my mom started going.
Probably my other sister.
Then I became a fan.
Jeff is always there.
He has a great eye.
He also puts up with my last minute request without issue.
I know I can trust him to come up with great arrangements time & time again.
My favorite thing though is to go in there & see what he has in, look at some of the vases & suggest a thing or two.
Then I let him do the magic and get out of his way.
That way I end up with something a bit personal but done in great style.
The arrangements are always a great value as well.
I will admit that I've even looked on-line recently (proflowers.com) but once they tack on all their add-on fees, handling fees, shipping, etc., there's really no reason at all not to go local.
Arcadia Flowers is definitely my go to flower shop.

Jeff has been my go-to guy for beautiful flowers for over 20 years.
His arrangements are always lovely, and he is generous within each price range.
He uses high quality flowers.
The fact that he is such a nice person is a huge bonus!

Went to pick up a bouquet for my sister in law.
As I was getting my son out of the car, he runs for a corvette parked a few spots over (a seriously rad looking one too).
The owner comes out screaming "you can't park here" and tells us to leave.
I suppose he thought we were headed to the bar next door.
I was about to tell him we were there to buy flowers, but he was so rude we just left instead.
