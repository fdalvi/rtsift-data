Naricissus was famous for looking at himself in the mirror, when this business charges £7.50 for THREE balloons, I'm surprised they owners can do the same in the morning.
I wonder like Naricissus, if these are gifts from the Greek gods?
Hopefully at that price, they'll be able to predict the future and never burst, maybe even feed the third world?
I know the recession hit us hard, but nobody told me about the Balloon tax...  Ps.
They also sell flowers!

Blokes, if you're going to buy flowers, you'd better make sure they're good ones.
Because it usually means that you've done something awful or want something that you know you're probably not likely to get, and so a withered £3 bunch from a petrol station probably isn't going to cut it on either of those counts.
Narcissus, on the other hand, could sort you out with the right bouquet although you would have to pay a fair whack for the privilege.
When I was meeting a friend in this part of town today I was early and had time to kill, so I popped in here to have a nosey, and there's no denying that their stock is gorgeous if a little on the pricey side.
But, as L'Oréal so cheesily puts it, we're worth it.

I walked past Narcissus Flowers the other day with G-Bot.
I saw some gorgeous blooms and potted plants and pleaded with my to get him some.
He didn't.
That didn't stop me going back in for a look later on as this florists is absolutely beautiful!
They have an excellent selection of bouquets, potted plants, hanging baskets and individual flowers.
Whether you need a bunch of flowers for a gift or if you're looking for some beauties to brighten up your home then you won't be disappointed by the choice and colours on offer here at Narcissus.
Absolutely beautiful!
G-Bot, if you're reading this, I'll be waiting for my Narcissus bouquet any day now.
Thanks.
