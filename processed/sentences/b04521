I remember back in the day when Hot Topic and Spencers seemed like different stores.
Today, I can't really tell a difference as they kind of sell the same weird kind of crap.
I went with a friend and they didn't have what they were looking for.
At least the staff was knowledgeable of their store and let us know so we didn't have to walk around like 12yr old zombies trying to find something that wasn't there.

good place to get some t's for my daughter

My kids love this place.
Cool shirts and gear based upon cable shows and rock groups.
Obviously for a youthful demographic.
Sales people certainly represent that.
Prices seem reasonable for licensed items.
Quality seems good too.

Pop culture heaven in useful items like clothes, wallets, phone cases, jewelry, music, fragrances and more for both males & females.
Always love the variety.
Pricey, but they usually run sales so you rarely have to pay full prices.
