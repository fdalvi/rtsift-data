I don't care how much chrome you put on the pillars, or how beautiful the mosaic tile work is, you can't be a classy establishment when you're encasing fish in a 3 inch tomb of batter.
It's not happening.
At least The Mermaid is trying, although I wish they had spend less money on decor and invested in a better frying unit.
The chips were piping hot on the outside, but stone cold on the inside.
The sausage was cooked very well and actually had a little bit of flavor to it.
Not a great chippy, just a good chippy.

Steak pie supper around half the price of other more central establishments yet with no loss of quality in either the chips or the pie.
A chipper to make more use of I think.
