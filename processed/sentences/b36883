I am a dude and therefore I don't browse when I shop.
My shopping style could be described as hit and run.
We were on our way to the restaurant next door and we were drawn in by all the interesting stuff.
I lost track of time looking at things I've never seen before.
I stood there thinking, "this stuff is cool, but I have no idea what to do with it.
"  I did say I am a dude...  Lucky for me the people here had ideas how to showcase the goods inside my home.
There is a lot to check out for such a small place.
I recommend checking it out between appetizers and main course next door, you won't be disappointed.
I ended up buying a cool glass vase that hasn't left my breakfast nook table since I got it.
I don't know if I lose my dude status after buying a vase, but it was worth it.

You should see the killer golden skull and custom fabrics I got from River North!!!!
This place is small but amazing.
They must have relationships with some really unique artisans and vendors because I was blown away.
I have some edgy, upscale rock and roll tastes and they go beyond the cool modern designs...Check this place out and access their design team.
Thanks for the consult; your ideas really helped me with my custom home project.
This place rocks!
