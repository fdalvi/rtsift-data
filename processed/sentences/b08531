Every time I come here they mess something up.
Whether it be medium instead of large, everything instead of plain, regular fries when I ask for curlies, this place does it all.
Do not come here if you can help it.

how can you dislike Jack?
If you are coming here, you shouldn't expect 5-star dining.
I got what I wanted, hot, and quick.

Stopped by for late night taco's.
Service seemed good very friendly.
Got home pulled out tacos and there was a brown liquid all over the outside wrap to the tacos.
It looked like something had spilled all over them.
I pulled out the tacos and they were full of grease.
I took them back and showed them and said this is what happens when you re-fry.
And she agreed.
Asked if I wanted new ones.
Got a refund.
In the back I see a guy making new ones.
I made a comment.
She asked again if I wanted new ones.
Still took the refund.
Told her she was lucky I did not take pics to send to there corporate office.
Disgusting!
