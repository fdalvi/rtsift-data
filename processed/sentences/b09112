Wow-I am writing this review because I have had a lot of frusterations at this location-mainly is just the pharamacy.
I only go to this location and gave it a star because it is conviently located and they have a drive thru that stays open fairly late.
I often debate whether or not to find a new location though...
I have been going to this pharmacy location for several months and it seems to me that all of the pharmacy people are very short tempered-I don't understand why they all seem to have bad attitudes???
Something about what's going on with the staff in the pharmacy is not right.
I've had to go inside and complain to the manager it was so bad..he told me the day that I complained that I was the 3rd person to complain that day...shocking!!!
I wonder how many complaints they got the rest of that day or any other day for that matter...I went back probably a week later and their bad attitudes still persist..
Unless you know exactly what you want and are ready for a quick in and out-double charge on your visa card at the drive thru pharamcy-I don't recommend filling scripts here on a regular basis!

As close as this Walgreens is to our house, I rarely come here.
Don't ask my why, it's just never on my radar.
It's a standard Walgreens and offers the same layout and products that others have.
My most recent visit was just after Easter.
We dropped by here on the way home from Church to pick up some Easter Candies that were on sale.
I love the after-holiday sales where you can pick up stuff at big discounts.
I'll have to drop by more often.
