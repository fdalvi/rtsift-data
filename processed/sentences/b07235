Love Mulligan's!
Food is great!
Nice escape for a quiet lunch meeting!
Very peaceful eating at a golf course in a casual setting!

Came here for breakfast and the food was great.
I had bacon, eggs, hash browns, and toast for only $5.
The bacon was excellent quality and everything was cooked to perfection.
I'll be back again!

I think this place has very good burgers and fries and will have to leave it at that as I never tried anything else.
Seriously the burgers are better than going to the place up the street that specializes in burgers.
The owner is serious but has a friendly under current.
The big guy reminds me of the larger guy in the Penn & Teller duo but I have found him to be OK moody.
On the 8th tee there is a sign inviting you to call in your food order to be picked up on the turn.
The other day I played golf and we called from the 8th fairway to place an order got a answering machine.
I tried again on the 9th tee and a girl answered and said she was too busy to take an order.
We stopped in after the 9th and there was no one in the restaurant so we waited for a her to make a couple of hot dogs which she butterflied to give them the special touch.
This was around 12:40 and I don't think she should be left alone during the midday lunch period.
I can only think the owner had to run an errand so this experience will not change my loyalty to this business.
It is good food at reasonable prices so I recommend it and will look forward to lunch when I golf Encanto.
