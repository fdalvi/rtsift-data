Service is good.
Food is gross, no wonder why its hidden...

Service was excellent!
They were super fast.
They have one of those cool coke machines that has 100+ flavors.
The food was as good as any other Wendy's.

So bad.
Service is always so slow inside.
It's like they only care about the drive through and they usually screw that up too.
I know it's Wendy's so my expectations aren't high but this place still manages to consistently disappoint.
Seems like poor managers.
Once I had a really nice cashier that was trying hard and even asked for help from other employees when she got backed up but she was told to stop complaining and just go slower.
I looked around and saw two other employees flirting with a group of teenagers pretending to clean tables.
I could go on with more stories like this but the general trend is slooow bad service with managers who are mean and don't care about customers.
