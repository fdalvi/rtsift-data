I love the warm reception I receive when ever I come to this nail salon.
The ladies are super friendly and they do a nice massage with my very well done pedicure.
my only complaint would be that they need they more color polishes to choose from.Desert Nails is.
convenient and a bit of a hidden gem in the Summerlin area.

Joleen did an amazing job on my nails.
I got a gel manicure and it looks beautiful and the price was better than another place I had recently gone to.
I'm definitely going to recommend Desert Nails to my friends.

The negative reviews of Joleen are very concerning.
I suspect someone is operating from a disingenuous place in their heart.
Perhaps they are jealous of her growth and desire to venture out on her own.
I've been her client for years and her work and cleanliness is impeccable.
Its sad others take their time attempting to sabotage someone with such high integrity.
I trust you can read between the lines.
Best.

Best in Las Vegas......New owner Joleen is  great and really cares about her customers.
Nice, clean, great location, and caters to us "Sun City Ladies".
Everyone is very friendly.
I am very picky and have tried many salons, she does beautiful mani/pedi's.
Many of my friends now go to her as well and they are just as happy as I am.

My roommate and I just got our nails done.
I got the gel replaced on my toes+hands, no fill, no manicure/pedicure and it costs me $68.
My roommate on the other hand, was charged $120 (not including her eyebrow wax).
Supposedly, if you get a french you are using two different colors and they charge you $20 a pop.
Her spa pedicure was $35, and the color was the same price.
They took $5 dollars off one of the colors.
And the french on my hands looks like a cosmetology student could have done it better.
Yes, that is $70 dollars for a pedicure, so if they didn't take the 5 off it would have been $75 !!!!!!
The work is below average, the spa is average, but the employees are sweet.
I'd stay away, there are far better places for cheaper !!!!!!
And we're not the only ones who have felt ripped off from here if you read the other reviews !!

Clean, walk-in friendly and open on Sundays!!
They gentlemen who did my pedicure was so sweet and truly gentle.
$30 for a medi pedi too!
