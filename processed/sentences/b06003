Love love love this place... CEWC is a great place to worship!!
This is definitely a spirit-filled church.
There is a feeling of love and family when you come in... Pastor Conner delivers the Word in a way that is understandable and practical while also bringing humor and entertainment.
If your looking for a church based on the Truth then this is the place to be... See you at the Embassy!

This is the best Church in Las Vegas!
Praise and worship is awesome.
The present of the Lord is always here!
