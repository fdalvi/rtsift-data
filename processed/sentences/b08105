These people know nothing about customer service.
I had to call multiple times to get someone on the phone during office hours.
They would answer the phone mid conversation and continue to help the person on the phone instead of the person in front of them.
If I had a choice where to go, I would never rent from here again.

This place and hertz in general lost a loyal customer.
Tis place is unprofessional and did not care about me as a customer.
They got my reservation wrong and these "sales people" that get a commission out of selling you extra stuff on rental like insurance or gas fillip etc.
Any who these snakes right here are salespeople now customer service and that's a shame

BEWARE: These guys will mess up your bank account, and will provide a horrible customer service to go with it.
They will only sign you up for insurance without your prior approval.
