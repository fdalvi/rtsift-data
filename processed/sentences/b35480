The spring on my garage door snapped and my car was trapped in the garage.
I called Affordable Garage Door Repair.
Rick Lane was there within two hours of my call.
He was very professional and had my door repaired within 30 min.
Upfront pricing with no surprises!
Highly recommend!

For months of my garage making weird noises it finally stopped working.
After looking on yelp for a good repair man and nobody answering I called this company.
The owner Rick was able to pin point the problem over the phone and give me a cost.
His cost was very reasonable and he fix my garage with no hassle.
I was very pleased with his work and his customer service.
I will be using him again!

They seem to pride themselves on prompt service, well it took him two days to get out to me.
But that's not the problem.
Soon as he gets to my house he sees I have a Genie garage door opener.
First thing he says is "Oh no why did you get a Genie?
Those are garbage and total junk.
" Kept on saying how much of a piece of crap it is.
He says "Oh you bought the worst opener possible.
" He refused to even work on it because he doesn't like them.
All I needed him to do is wire it up with the sensors and the opener button.
Rudest person I have ever met.
If you want him to come and insult you about how stupid you were to buy something its the worst thing ever, than go with him.
But if you don't like being insulted, definitely stay away from Affordable Garage Door and Opener repair.
