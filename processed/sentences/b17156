This used to be my favorite weekday hangout, and on Thursdays it was usually packed (with underage drinkers) for karaoke.
They eventually caught on and hired a bouncer.
The bar soon went empty, but this was okay with me and my friends.
It got rid of the "Ohmigod, like, totally!
" girls, and the "oh, yeah bro" guys, and left room for us twenty somethings to stretch out a bit.
There are still some older regulars and the occasional slip of the under-ager, but it doesn't effect us.
There is a jukebox, pool table, and dart board if you get bored with the video poker machines, and the bartenders are always friendly.
The food is decent, and there is a cozy dining room to sit in as well.
Red Hawk is a nice bar (now) for a casual drink or game of pool if you're bored on a weekday night.

This place has 2 pool tables and shuffleboard.
There is also weekly karaoke.
The bar staff is friendly as are the patrons.
I haven't been here before and felt quite at home.
That last reviewer must have been smoking crack, or a fired employee or something.
Nice place to hang out.

The Red Hawk is a locals bar that is good for gamers during the day and for the partier at night.
Come as you are, casual.
Great food and great people.
