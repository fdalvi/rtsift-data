This is a new location for Picasso's from Fitchburg.
Ordered pizza's recently to check it out.
Very average.
Probably won't order them again.
Check that.
We've gone back recently for a couple of meals.
Both were pretty decent.
I still think the pizza lacks seasoning and has a very bland flat bread like crust.
But the pasta dishes, including t he lasagna, were tasty.
Would like to see more non-cream sauces and vegatarian options.

Our first visit, right after they opened in McFarland, was fair, although the pizzas were aggressively priced.
Not to mention nearly $4 for a little pile of greens called a 'side salad'.
Ahem, right.
Our second visit was much more successful- I ordered the lasagna, Mister ordered a chicken caesar.
Both were good, and the pesto hidden in the lasagna was a tasty treat.
Service was good, as were the leftovers!

I thought the pizza here was very good.
I had some pesto chicken pizza and I would recommend it!
Good flavor.
Service wasn't great but they were pretty busy.
When our drinks were empty I thought she had forgotten about us.
I always love it when they finally come running over and ask how everything is.
We say (with a full mouth) good and before we can ask for a refill she starts to bolt.... what about the 2 empty glasses??
I have to ask for a refill!!?!?
I love it when wait staff are on top of your drinks.
Gotta have something to wash that pie down with!
All and all if you are in this neck of the woods and feel like some tasty italian or pizza don't be afraid to stop in and check it out I think you will be pleasantly surprised!

The food is wonderful.
Great menu with Class A selection.
Price is higher but worth it.

Absolutely nothing special about this place.
Not worth a second visit.
It is sad that best moderately priced Italian restaurant is Olive Garden.

Good folks and good food - warm and cozy - nice small bar
