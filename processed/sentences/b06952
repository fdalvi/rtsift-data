Dave the manager is nice, and they seem like a good place to go for brakes.
Make sure you visit their STORE WEBSITE, found on the midas homepage.
there are good coupons on there for some $$$ off.

I have heard good things about this shop.
I had a bad experience at the east side Midas many years ago when the repairman tried to sell me something I did not need.
That was over 20 years ago so I decided to give them another try.
See how long it takes for a bad experience to wear off!
Was it really worth the hard sell to have to wait this long for me to come back?
But they did a good job for me.
No hard sell, in fact just the opposite.
When they could have they were polite and helpful.
The man at the front desk was excellent.
He is an example of the sort of professional that I want to help me for maintenance work.
They did take longer than they said it would.
It ended up taking twice as long as they first quoted me.
So I was disappointed in that.
Still the time was not terrible for what I had done.
Keep up the good work.
I will be back.

I got my front brake pads + rotors replaced for $325.
It was quick, painless, and reasonably priced.
They have complimentary wifi if you are going to sit in the shop and do work (like I did).
DO visit their website for coupons.
I didn't and I feel like a dummy.

Service was good and so was the price  The pros of visiting a place like Midas over a quick lube place is that they can check things like tires and brakes and advise you on wear.
I may visit this place again but the cons of this location was that they promised me 45 minutes and it took an 1 1/4 hours AND their Wi-Fi doesn't work properly.
Had to go to Cargo Coffee to check emails.
