The best hairdresser works here.
She cuts and colors my hair.
My friends are always Jelous!
The staff are friendly.
Plus, my African American girls will find some of the best hairstylists there.

I normally don't write reviews, however I read them alot to make my decisions on where I'm going to vacation or eat etc.
Well this review is based on hair.
This is one of the best  and professional salons in the Las Vegas area.
They use great products and will hook your hair up!
It doesnt matter what nationality you are they are all located at Self Expressions.
The owner, Tammy has been doing hair over 25 years and still maintains her same clientele.
Trice is another stylist that took up some of her training by the owner.
Jazzy does the best and lastest nails and pedicures you have ever seen.
You must go check the this Salon out...nice and clean!

I love love love this place!
I was told abt it from a co-worker abt 7mos ago.
I have been here for 8 yrs and couldn't find a place that can handle affordable mixed-black hair "naturally" until I met my hairstylist Patrice.
She is always booked but so worth the wait!
All she does is give me a great damn wash, an AMAZING conditoning(me and my coworker rave abt her conditionings).....and presses my hair leaving it healthy, shiny and manageable for a good 2weeks!
I love the fact that she didn't just jump in and want to put a relaxer or any chemicals in my hair.
i prefer just natural and I have been going to her ever since!
