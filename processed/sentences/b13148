Since I reviewed Nathan's I should review the exact opposite of a good hot dog joint.
I do love the dogs.
One day in high school, my friends and I had a day where we did stuff that we'd never done before.
One of those things was go to a Wienerschnitzel.
I didn't like it then.
I then married a man who LOVED Wienerschnitzel and would bring it home at every opportunity.
I then learned that I hate Wienerschnitzel.
I've made better hot dogs at home on my grill much cheaper.
I don't know what they do to them - mayhap I don't have enough fake German in me to like them - but they've always tasted slightly of ass and cat food.

they take kinda long but that is because they make sure your corndogs are fresh and delicious.

I love weiners!
The pastrami is pretty good too!
