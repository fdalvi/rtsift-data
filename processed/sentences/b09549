Fast, convenient, Chinese fast-food in the middle of Phoenix.
This location receives a tremendous amount of traffic, but rarely runs out of food (causing a delay).
Have rarely seen the place dirty, and have never had to wait more than 10 minutes.. All in all, a great, quick stop for Orange Chicken!

Even though it's a chain not all chain's are bad.
I kept being taunted by my TV one day and thought I would try the Panda.
Well I like the new Bejing Beef with lo mein noodles.
It is pretty tasty, quick and convenient.
The egg rolls I didn't really care for.
But the pepper chicken is good.
This location stays busy so food is usually fresh and hot.

I like Panda Express in general - it is some of the better "chain" Asian food in my opinion.
But after eating here today for lunch, I got a really hard MSG crash.
My coworker reported the same thing.
The only thing that will really make me crash hard like this and desperately want a nap is MSG.
Service was really slow today (Monday @ lunch).
I had went to this location about a week ago on a Saturday and service was much better, and no MSG crash.
I'm sure Panda Express will deny they use MSG, but I'm certain they do.
My favorite dishes are: the veggie spring rolls and the Beijing beef, though I think the spring rolls might be the MSG culprit.

This was my choice for lunch to go last Wednesday.
I have been in this location at least a dozen times.
It always seems to be pretty busy (and noisy).
Today I chose the Sweet Fire chicken and the Honey Walnut shrimp, both items are not on their standard menu.
As usual I got the chow mein with mine, it is easier to eat with chop sticks than rice.
The food and service were fine and I was definitely full when finished.

I enjoy stopping by after shooting hoops Sunday nights.
The store is well ran.
Clean store, fast service.
No surprise that they have a line to the door at 9 pm on Sunday nights.

Yum!
It was great customer service we received.
This has got to be the only panda express with a giant logo!
I already had panda express like a thousand times so it's nothing unique from my taste bud.
(I used to work at panda) the food came out fresh and the place was really clean.

Good food.
Okay service.
Every time I've been here it gets busy at different times and hours during the day even at night when they are about to close.
I don't know why this place is always packed.
