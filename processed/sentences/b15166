This is our third choice, of our selection of stores we chose to go!
It's a decent store, just never been a great fan of Safeway!
Prices are not the greatest and their selection isn't the best.
But they have helped out a few times,

yup, i deliver fuel here

Clean, and friendly service, however they never have enough cashiers!
I've been several times, but now I only go if I absolutely can't find something I'm looking for.
They could learn a lot from Frys grocery store!
As soon as the lines get long, more clerks are called to the front,(FRys) which avoids long wait times and super long lines!
My suggestion to Safeway would be; if you only have two aisles open and they are both long, try calling more cashiers so we aren't waiting forever.
I've heard other customers complain of the very same thing.
