One of my tiny sister's favotite stores.
I've been a few times for a slurge, and loved it.
They carry casual and career clothing, and have a good selection of petite sizes.
This isn't Target, folks, so don't go expecting to get a drop-dead gorgeous dress for twenty buck.
But the quality is high.
Sometimes, you get what you pay for.

I don't usually review stores like this, they are kinda all the same!
But I had such amazing service here this weekend despite how busy it was that I couldn't resist.
I went in because they had 40% of everything in the store including sale merchandise.
I got skirts for under $20 a piece!
While in the fitting room, the women working that area was amazing she was running around getting everyone different sizes/colors, etc.
She was super helpful.
Probably the best service I have ever had in a store.
She was pleasant and very patient.

Love Love Love Ann Taylor LOFT!
Step into my closet, and you'll probably see more than a handful of LOFT tags on the rack.
This store is great for business casual clothing and your everyday threads.
Flattering fits (petite included), quality apparel, trendy-yet-classic styles and darling dresses are the things that keep me coming back time and time again.
At the same time, it's hit or miss.
Is LOFT apparel a bit on the pricey side?
Absolutely.
But go into the Ann Taylor store a few shops down, and you'll come running back as if someone were chasing you with a Taser.
On that note, once you become a LOFT Insider (e-mail) you will find that they hold some serious sales on the regular.
Forty percent off and higher.
If you plan your trips right, you can come away with some steals.
There's also a credit card with rewards.
Personally, haven't opened one.
And probably won't.
Sales Associates are genuinely sweet ladies and never pushy on getting you to purchase anything.
More than helpful if you ever need input on how an ensemble looks, or where to start on finding a look that best suits you.
