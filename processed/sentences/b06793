Yummmyyyyyyyyy truffles!

Huddled in the Hilldale Shopping center is this fun little candy shop.
If you're a purist candy connoisseur, they've got you covered with the tradish sweets like caramels and chocolate nougat.
If you want a bit of pizazz for your sugar rush, try the chocolate covered ginger, or orange rind which packs a bit of a punch in your bite.
They might be small, but they've got some big flavors!

I hate to say it, but every so often I get a Pixie craving that just won't quit, and if I'm in Metcalfe's grabbing groceries, forget about it!
I will most certainly get a quick fix if I'm already there.
And I realize admitting this for all the world to see means admitting that I walk past Madison's most loved chocolatiers celebrated and stocked by Metcalfe's in exchange for some sub par Pixies that came off a truck, but I'm ok with that.
Have you had one?
When I was little I used to do clothing shopping at Golf Mill mall with my mom and if I made it through the day without completely melting down at the fact that she had to buy me husky pants (god what I wouldn't do for a little elastic waistband these days) I could pick out a treat at Fannie May.
Ironic?
They had this weird nutty, chocolaty marshmallow thing I liked simply because of it's size, but the Pixie was my jam.
Now back then before I new what good chocolate tasted like, milk chocolate calmed my urge.
These days, dark is where it's at.
Although they wanted to make their new retail space at Hilldale fancier than it should be, it's not like gourmet chocolatiers are working round the clock to bring you crafted delights, the space is pretty sharp; Crisp, clean and bright white with traditional red accents.
It reminds me of what my childhood visits used to be like, but instead of husky pants with elastic waistbands, I'm there shopping for kale and quinoa.
