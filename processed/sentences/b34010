Great looking shop!!
Inventory is still a little slim but I recommended some products and the next week they carried them!!
Great costumer service!
So glad there is a smoke shop in Maricopa now.
Thank you Smokers Edge!

I've only gone here to buy shisha for our hookah, but I've had a good experience every time.
Friendly staff and a good selection of flavors, plus sometimes I can find coupons for what I want.
It's nice to have a local place to buy this stuff.

A nice clean shop, friendly staff.
It's too bad so many uptight small town people thing the idea of a smoke shop is just evil.
If it were up to me, I'd locate it next to a church and a day care.
