Best in town

PAUL, my hero, my barber.
For years and years, he has taken care of me with his consistent, immaculate fades.
Why would I ever need to go anywhere else?
Well, I guess when Paul goes on vacation, Max, Tony and Roman are always ready and have all the skills and tools necessary to deliver any kind of cut.
Walk-ins only.
Comfortable and plentiful seating.
Can get REALLY busy at peak times, but worth the wait.
Sports, Spike, or A&E are always on the flatscreen TVs they have mounted over the mirrors.

Great barber shop.
Went here the first time and will be going back.
The shave your neck which is key.

All these guys are great and I love that they use a straight razor to shave my neck and all the edges.
Great job guys!!

This is my barber shop of preference.
Been going here for a year now, they do a good job and  are really friendly people.
Paul does the best job with my hair.
