Gina is the BEST small business attorney in Las Vegas.
Call her, you will not be disapointed.

I refer my own clients and friends to Gina for small business legal work.

Gina and her team were great to work with.
My business partner and I are from Canada and we wanted to set-up a business in Las Vegas.
Gina along with Bobby and Kristina were great in helping us form our business and answer any questions we may have.
Even when we stumbled upon a small hurdle, they were there to help us through and through, looking for solutions and alternatives.
We're very satisfied to have them form our business with Bongiovi Law Firm and will definitely be working with them again for any future endeavours.
