Apart from an interesting use of the letter K when a C would have been perfectly alright, this is just another newsagents.
Portobello has a fair few of these, and this one is just like any other.
It has the normal range of alcohol, snacks, sweets, and magazines.
There was also a good range of tinned goods and other non-perishable food items.
The floor space went back surprisingly far, and the stock was definitely crammed in.
Not much more that can be said really: this is another handy local newsagents.

The use of the K's, as Mark says, seems a bit pointless, as the alliteration would have worked just as well with "Cost Conscious".
However, tis is a pretty average newsagents that stocks much the same items as you see in hundreds of other newsagents and that makes it A-OK in my books.
The shop offers a pretty good range of items, but the key area in which it excels is its range of alcohol.
There is a great range of beers, spirits, wines and ciders that would be of great convenience to the local residents if a trip to the supermarket seems a bit too much.
Other than that they do a good range of food items, but they are a bit more expensive than you will find at the supermarket, so it would be best to not do any bulk buying here.

Looking for a hardware in this area is impossible, but this is the nearest that you will get to one unless you are willing to travel a distance.
I would describe this store more of a corner shop with the added on section of nuts and bolts at an inflated price.
It is a handy wee store for the area stocking your essentials of milk and bread & buckfast, with a good selection of magazines and daily papers.
