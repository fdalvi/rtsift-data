What a find!!
They give samples so you can try before you buy but the chicken and rib eye is so amazing and their portions are a great size!

The owner seems a bit pushy.
And some things just doesnt seem right.
Hummus dry.
I asked for a sandwhich and he just throws the things on the plate.
The meat is ok.
But customer service will put his business out.
One worker tried to help correct him but he just kept on doing what he wanted.
I was only here in vegas to take some time off and I wanted to try something away from the strip.
Biggest mistake ever.

Food was very good and reasonably priced.
Was given plenty of samples in order to help determine what I wanted to order.

We decided to  go to the boulevard mall on a Saturday afternoon.
Shopping made us hungry so we decided to try the food court for lunch.
We were looking for something fairly healthy.
This place seemed like the best choice.
There was a man and woman behind the counter and a little girl.
The man was very friendly.
He gave us a sample of chicken which was delicious!
We had a plate with salad, grilled veggies, roasted potato and some of that really good chicken.
I've read some reviews in which yelpers found the man behind the counter (which I guess is the owner) as being pushy but my family and I found him to be very nice and somewhat entertaining.
The food was good.
Everything tasted fresh and we were very pleased with our lunch!
