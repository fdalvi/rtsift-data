2 large cokes for almost $5 !?!?
Hell with you, czar of sirloin!
I'm going to McDonalds, Carl's Jr or QuikTrip from now on.

This place is absolutely disgusting.
The workers here are terrible, and the service is so slow.
The food is outrageously expensive, and you get terrible service and quality.

Really bad, only Burger King I have ever seen that charges you $1 for the kids toy that the menu says is free.

Disgusting.
Ordered a double whopper which was inedible.
I took about 4 bites cause I felt bad wasting it.
But then I just had to throw it away cause I couldn't take it anymore.
Don't bother visiting this location.
Disgusting waste of money.
Sad, cause I used to love the whopper.
