We have been working with Jeana for just over a year now and she have been extremely helpful and great to work with.
We would highly recommend her practice to anyone.

My wife, Dixie, has had the pleasure of assisting Jeana for the past three years with Escrow related transactions.
She has found her to be very knowledgeable, helpful, and great to work with!
She is highly recommended!

I worked with Jeana on some touchy real estate issues and her advice was spot on!She was very prompt and thorough in her responses.
I could not have been happier with my results.
