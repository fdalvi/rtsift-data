Although the stores that would most match my decorating style at Kierland are Crate and Barrel and Z Gallery I love indulging in the crazy interior designs at Artafax.
Very modern and very out side of the box is what best describes the items at Artafax.
Really great store to get a unique gift for a friend.
Check it out!
You may not buy anything but trust me you will be amused and inspired.
One thing I did buy from Artafax: cheap red wine chap-stick :)

This is a great shop.
Stopped in a few nights ago just as they were closing.
I was trying to hurry and look at everything so I staff could get out of there on time.
But they were super cool and said they still had lots to do and take our time.
I bought a really cute necklace - its a tiny wishbone on a very thin thread that you are to wear until it falls off and then your wish will come true - how cute is that!!!!
Wonderful wine racks too!!
I love this place.

A good place to find fun, modern and retro-modern furniture and gifts.
It is not exactly an "art" store, but they do carry some more popular modern housewear lines like alessi.

I was sad to see this place go for what appears to be the final time.
Great store when it was at Fascist Square years ago, quirky when it was at kierland, and still had cool stuff at this off the beaten path location.
Sad to think it may be down for the final time.

So bummed this store closed.
The owner was a super nice guy with amazing taste in furnishings and so much more.
Was a fan from the time they were in Scottsdale Fashion Square.
