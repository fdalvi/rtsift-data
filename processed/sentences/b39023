This little mall quick restaurant was right by our hotel- and was a nice inexpensive break from most Vegas food.
The two people working were very kind despite having no air in 100+ heat which is more than I would be able to give in that heat.
The bourbon chicken and orange chicken were good.
Fried rice was very bland.
Pluses: quick, good tasting, friendly service Negatives: seating area was very dirty

I'm staying on the Strip, I need someplace reasonably priced to eat lunch, I don't want to go far, and I want it to be easy to take it back to the room.
Thank you China Max for fulfilling my needs!
