Monona Motors (and John...is it?
) makes my '96 Geo Metro happy -  and has so for the past 8 years.
They do great work, are incredibly honest, and always treat you like a valuable customer.
You do pay for it - in the long run though, it is TOTALLY worth every cent.

I really trust the guys at Monona Motors.
I feel that their prices are fair, and they will explain things in lay-man's terms.
I feel fortunate to have an honest, quality garage like this in my neighborhood.

Great work at a fair price.
I recommend without hesitation.

Don't let the rough exterior fool you, but this place is great!
John and his crew were very honest and personable.
Would recommend without hesitation!

Happy to echo the sentiments here - good, honest shop with fair prices.
No up-sell here - I've actually had them tell me I didn't need work after another shop tried to tell me I did.
Keeps me coming back, for sure.
Awesome building, and historic - apparently, the city of Monona was founded there!
