My experiece with them is a so so to below average.
Not too long ago, I had purchased a meal deal through drive through one morning.
I was told to park in the front and wait for my food, I noticed two customers after me was told to park in the front as well.
after 5 minutes of waiting I noticed one of the employees had a meal, she denied it was mine.
Patience was not a virtue with me that day.
The Second customer after me got his meal.
Noticing that I was first and had not yet gotten my food was not right.
So I walked in and asked whats goin on with my order, the employee asked for the second time what I had ordered *the order she denied it was my order was really mine*.
I did call the manager that morning and expressed my dismay for a lack of communcation and slow food.
He did the right thing and gave me a complementary meal and he had let me know what went wrong that morning (the cook was MIA).
when I had showed up at the store, he had personally came from his office and apologized for the mess up.
I thought all was well until I had ordered my comp meal that the employees may have been messing with me?
(its just a theory).
Three other customers after me got their meal before I did.
So I had walked over to the shift manager and asked if my meal was ready, his stupid ass response was "I was wondering why that sandwich was sitting there".
I got my food and left.
I would travel a distance in the other direciton to another burger king that has excellent speedy service vs this one.
I'm glad that I dont have stock in this company.
One star:  For the store Manager (my cost management professor would be proud for his actions, doing everything in his power to make the guest happy; giving me a comp meal).
Two Star: free meal

I don't really have any gripes about this location.
Everytime I order a "happy meal" they never correct me, simply give me what I want.
I always feel a bit stupid afterwards but hey, it's an honest mistake.
They are pretty fast in the drive through and almost always clean on the inside.
I always get please and thank you from the employees here too.

My husband went there for breakfast and had to go back 3 times because each time they got his order wrong.
It's not hard to read the screen on an order.
A few times I went there through the drive-thru the person could barely speak English, wow!!!!!!!
I should have to speak another language other than English just to get my food order across and get it correct the first time.
