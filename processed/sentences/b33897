It's a mini-mart gas station.
The staff is always polite, and I usually find what I'm looking for when I go inside.

Super nice people who work here.
Really cool, nice folks...very personable.
They don't act like unhappy retail robots.
lol  Usually super quick with the occasional long long line, but overall, great experience here.
Also, their gas pumps are never busted, out of order, etc...  Rare, in my experience, to find that.
Parking lot is rather dangerous the way it's laid out, so just be super careful.

Polite staff.
Has fuel.
Inside its amazing for a small corner store all the grocery and non food items it has.

This GVG location is fantastic.
It has all you could need from a small "7-11" style gas station / food mart location.
The staff is very friendly and professional.
They are always in-stock on all of the essential items that people normally run into a Green Valley Grocery to get.
Gas is slightly higher priced than other gas stations in the area, but, it's convenience makes it fine in a pinch.
It's a nice place and will continue to go there for the foreseeable future.
