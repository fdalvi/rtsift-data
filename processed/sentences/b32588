There isn't anything not to love about Las Vegas Coffee & Roast Company.
If they opened a coffee shop, there would be at least one regular in line right here.
The strong, aromatic brew is best served black over ice.
Instead of pouring hot coffee over plenty of ice, LVC&RC chills it ahead of time.
The end product is a truer taste of consistent goodness.
At the farmer's market, they have full pound bags for $12 and half pound ones for $6.
I had offered to pay for a cup of the chilled beverage the first time and the gentleman working gave it to me.
Easily one of the best iced coffees I have had.

This coffee is soooo good!
I am a big fan of the Brazilian.
It's way better then Starbucks.
I like that I can pamper myself with not only "fresh ground" coffee, but with coffee that was "just roasted" as well!

I recently took over a coffee shop in Denver, however, while on a trip in Las Vegas I was able to obtain freshly roasted beans from the Las Vegas Coffee and Roasting Company.
They went out of their way to roast my beans just before I headed home so I'd have the freshest possible product.
The owners are both extremely friendly, helpful and all around lovely people.
