Apparently, this place in the University of Phoenix building is brand new or just reopened, so going to break it in with a Yelp review.
Looks clean, with a somewhat smallish selection of cafeteria-type foods.
Friendly service.
I opted for the flatbread pizza.
They top the pizza, and put it in this conveyor-style oven (similar to some toasters I've seen at college cafeterias hotel continental breakfast rooms.
)  Quick and fast preparation, very cheap price, mediocre, salty taste.
Drinks are fairly pricy for the amount of soda you get.
Refills are worth almost as much as the full price drink.
Not bad.
Good if you work in the building and you forgot lunch at home.
You would do better getting a drink at QT or Circle K on your way in the morning.
They close early on Fridays.

I work in one of the buildings next door to where Rev is located and have been there a handful of times for the build your own salad when I did not bring my own lunch to work.
When this place first opened the salads were delicious!
Today I paid $6.11 for a salad and it was NOT impressive.
I got maybe 1 oz of chicken which did not even appear to be white chicken breast.
I got a little sprinkle of cheese and smattering of crouton crumbs on top.
The balsamic dressing was fine, but that's about it.
Very disappointing lunch today...

Just wish I could find an online menu/website that works:(
