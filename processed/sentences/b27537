I highly recommend Skin By Jessica to all.
Jessica is knowledgeable, professional and does an awesome job.
They do not come any better then this lady and   I promise you, you will not be disappointed!

Such a great experience!
Jessica is super nice and talkative.
She makes you immediately comfortable and talks you through the waxing process.
She did a great job and was very professional!

I was getting married in 3 days and realized that I had totally forgotten to schedule a wax....ahhhhh!
I started searching online and calling people, I left a message for Jessica and she called back and was able to work me in that day.
God bless this woman!
I was a stressed out bride and she calmed me down and made the wax a quick and painless experience.
She is my go to person for waxing.
I highly recommend Jessica.
She is awesome!
