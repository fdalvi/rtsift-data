A great place for swimming lessons for kids of all ages.
My daughter loves going to class!
Instructors are knowledgeable and friendly, which is helpful when your child is nervous about swimming.
To top it off, the cost for classes are very reasonable.
I haven't been here in cooler months but in the hot Las Vegas summer it can be warm and very humid inside so dress appropriately.

Fantastic Multi purpose facility.
Located on South Pavillion Center drive in Summerlin, the Pavilion Center Pool reopened in December 2010 after some upgrades and renovations which included a new enclosed roof.
The center includes * Fifty-meter by 25-yard indoor pool  * 14 lane competitive pool * One 1-meter springboard * One 3-meter springboard  * Pool Lift * One outdoor pavilion     Pavilion houses plenty of different club based organizations which includes Synchronized swimming, water polo, Children's swim classes as well as Viva Las Vegas Masters Swim team which encompasses triathletes, swimmers and pretty much anyone who desires to get in and learn to swim that are 16 years old and above.
The council also employs lifeguards every time the pool is open.
So if you come in on a recreational swim or you have kids that are not good swimmers, you'll have safety precautions in place.
Lockers are also available free of charge in both woman's and men's change rooms.
Also provided is hot showers as well.
I really do like this facility, it's clean and well organized.
They do not have a shop with swim products like swim wear, goggles or food/ drink products, so make sure to pack before you come by.
The council website for this facility is   http://www.lasvegasnevada.gov/Find/21065.htm  Overall a great facility with plenty of sports and accommodating levels.
Pavilion Center is a real jewel in the Summerlin area.
I really recommend here.
