I was in a last minute pinch to find dog sitters for our two rambunctious Boxers and called Love Your Pets Too based on a referral from a friend.
The owners Jimmie and Ben were very accommodating and so sweet when I spoke to them over the phone.
With only a days notice, they were able to stay at our house and texted me updates throughout the weekend.
We came home to very happy pups!
Ben and Jimmie are caring, trustworthy people who have a tremendous love for animals.
We will certainly use them again!

I have two kittens with a medical condition.
I had to travel for work and was trying to decide if I would board them or hire someone to come over and care for them in their own environment.
I did not want them stressed by a strange environment.
My vet recommended LYPT.
Paula came to the house to meet the kitties and discuss their care a couple of days before I had to leave for my trip.
She texted me few pics of them every day and a comment on how they were doing.
It made my mornings knowing they were well and tended to.
I got home and they were alive and well.
I will be using LYPT anytime I have to travel in the future.

Jimmi and her husband are the sweetest people ever, and truly love pets.
It is so nice to not have to board the dogs- instead, then can stay in our home with visits from them a few times a day.
We are so lucky we found them to pet sit our two dogs- one of which is part pit bull and quite hyper!!
They sent us pictures of the pups while we were away and we're very accommodating.
Will definitely be using them in the future!
