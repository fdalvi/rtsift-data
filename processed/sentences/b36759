I've been getting coffee here since they opened years ago.
Same employees all of these years, even though its in Safeway- that's pretty cool.
Coffee is standard, prices are high.
$10 for 2 grande mochas.
Only Starbucks... :/

Convenient location.
It's right across the street from where I work, so when I'm in need of caffeine I come here.
Staff has always been pleasant.
