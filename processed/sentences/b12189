I did some trade out work for Johnny's uptown for fixing his register system.
I charge $75 per hour a fairly cheap rate ($175 per hour for the geek squad).
It took me two hours to climb through all his rafters and trace down a network break.
He was fixed within 4 hours of calling me at 4 P.M.
Most places would have stuck him with a bill of over $500  for last minute and evening surcharges.
My boyfriend (Johnny's Employee) and I shared a stake and a bottle of wine.
Retail cost was $85  his employee discount made it $42.
I asked John Tallifer if he wanted me to bill him or he could trade out.
I have never seen some one gripe about saving $450 more in my life.
Like an Idiot I did some newspaper ads for him 2 of them for $100  again no foresight he called me 2 hours before they were due.
Then I did a sign for him for his other failing restaurant the pizza place Melrose caf I created 12 beautiful logos for his sign and a magazine made him 3 more they wanted to charge him a grand for it.
He sat behind me for 4 hours and directed me how he envisioned this atrocity he had me create.
I charged him $160 he loved the sign.
I realize why straight men are not designers After 30 days of not paying me he offered, to trade out dinner for 4.
My boyfriend's uncle was in town so we went to Johnny's to eat.
My filet was fantastic; the lobster was cold, old and had been frozen before.
The wine was good and the bill came to $400 well $200 for employees.
Again he bitched about saving a grand, called my partner a silly faggot and his black manager who set up the deal a stupid Nword.
My boyfriend quit and we left.
