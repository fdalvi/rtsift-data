Pros Super Cheap 7.00  Quick and Easy Cons  Everything Else food is beyond fatty and greasy everything deep fried.
Definitely felt my heart hurt after a little of the meal Fried Chicken kind of tasty Banana Egg rolls actually the bomb amazingly good Ill never go back but glad I tried.
My friend said if he was in the area and dying of hunger and happened to be right next to it he would try it again.
Lots of sketchy mystery meat

OMG.....do not eat here!
Food is horrible.
Food taste like it's been sitting there for 2 days.
Blah Blah Blah in taste.
I asked for ice for my soda and the ice tasted like they scraped it from the freezer, ice taste like dirt!
They fried the cheapest fish, not even tilapia.
The only thing worth eating was the chicharon bulalak (yeah i know spelling).
Save your 7.99 and go to Nany Glorias or Joy's on East Charleston.I should of known the food stunk especially when there was only 1 person eating the buffet.
If you want to have the runs for a week, then i suggest you go to EPOY's......yuck!
truly disgusting!

This place is pretty tasty and cheap not sure why theres not too many reviews!
7.00 cant beat that everything was fresh when we came in at 3pm.

Awesome food.
Always great.
Like the previous reviewer I don't understand the lack of reviews....
Seeing lots of old flips that don't take the time to rate maybe a good clue that its good.
Want some pakbet, BBQ or sinigang don't hesitate to eat here.
Cheap and is Really one of the first original TURO-TURO'S in Vegas...nnn

Epoys offer a variety of food and snacks.
food are always warm and tasty.
However, this restaurant is no longer in business.
a thai restaurant replaced it.
