Dr Berg is THEE BEST!
AWESOME person!
And George is probably the best receptionist Ive ever come across.
Very tight knit family environment!

Dr. Berg is an excellent physician and is highly trained and experienced.
If you are seeking acupuncture he is the go-to-guy!

Dr. Berg is wonderful!
Has really helped me with my MS using acupuncture.

I've been going to Dr. Berg for many years and consider him one of the best chiropractors in the state.
Having his certification in sports injuries, rehab and acupuncture has been a real asset for my family.
