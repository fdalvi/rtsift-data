As a student I always seem to be in and out of stationers constantly trying to buy more pens and pads of paper.
So when I was strolling along Portobello High Street, I came across Portobello Stationers.
It did not look too impressive from the outside, few stationers do.
This shop had a window display of traditional looking cards and some overly large balloons.
Inside the shop is not flamboyant and seems very restrained in its appearance.
The cards in the shop were not very funny and seemed very bland, perhaps like the cards you give someone you don't know well.
Furthermore, the shop stocks, your normal range of stationary, gift wrap and computer accessories, all neatly stocked in their appearance.
Compared to Creative Arts, this place is the reserved stationer's of Portobello.
It has a good selection of stock for what it is, but it lacks that much needed character.
