Five Stars  This is yet another great sprint location.
Friendly people fast service.
If I'm near I will return.
I went on a trip and saw this sprint so I went in to pay my bill.
It took 3 to 4 minutes I was in and out and I did leave happy :)

THIS IS THE WORST STORE EVER.
AND BECAUSE THEY ARE A THIRD PARTY SPRINT PROVIDER, SPRINT IS UNABLE TO RESOLVE ISSUES WITH THEIR SHODDY (to say the least) SERVICE.
I spent hours on the phone with both SPRINT and the store, each one claiming that the other was able to fix my issues.
I went in there looking for a phone ASAP as mine had broken.
Long story short I ordered a phone under the intentionally induced impression that it would be there the next day, when it was apparently common knowledge that it was backordered for weeks.
When I tried to cancel the order the very next day, I was told that was not possible--I would have to live with my broken phone until the new one came in, whenever that would be.
Cancelling is indeed possible and easy, according to the fifth SPRINT customer service representative I spoke to.
Apparently, he had to call the store several times and pressure them to cancel the order, after speaking with several employees who claimed that they could not.
SPRINT could not cancel the order.
Only they could.
The SPRINT customer service representative then had to call them several times to get them to reverse the upgrade use (which they claimed they could not do) and cancel the credit card charges (same).
He apparently pressured them to do so by informing them that they could indeed reverse the upgrade use and cancel the credit card charges.
SPRINT could not help with any of this because the store is a third party service provider and SPRINT does not have access to or control over its system.
The only way to cancel the order and receive a refund is to beg the store to do so.
This store is full of employees who are either liars and/or incompetent, and certainly not apologetic for possessing either of these traits.
DO NOT USE THIS STORE.
Because they are a "third party" sprint provider, THEY ACCOUNT TO NO ONE.
No one at SPRINT could help me fix the giant mess they made of my phone and my account (they said that they did not have access to a third-party store's system), but the store kept telling me they could not do anything and that SPRINT was to blame.
I WAS ONLY ABLE TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE BY PRESSURING A REAL SPRINT EMPLOYEE TO CONTINUALLY CALL THE STORE AND PRESSURE IT TO DO WHAT IT WAS REQUIRED TO DO.
There was NOTHING Sprint could do other than harass the store itself (since my phone calls were not doing the trick).
If you still choose to go to a third-party service provider, DO NOT GO TO THIS ONE.
Here are two other examples of the way they conduct their business: (1) my phone ended up being shut off for a brief period because the new phone was "accidentally" activated (despite the fact that I had not yet received it); and (2) immediately after the sale, the store made several charges to my sprint account for "overnight shipping" and "activation" fees, despite the fact that nothing was shipped "overnight" or "activated.
"  I suspect that this was an attempt to improperly collect moneys from either Sprint or myself.
