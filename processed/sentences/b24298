Just visited this location this afternoon and it is fantastic!
The place is located in the same parking lot as the Las Vegas Athletic Club on Eastern and Pebble, and it is super clean and it seems a lot larger than the town square store.
Also, it has several tables inside and dispenser with ice water in the corner.
The flavors are the same as other locations and has even more toppings than other places.
The tart and eggnog flavors were sooo good (although not when they mixed in the middle :P).
Also, the mochi was super fresh and chewy, and the strawberries and blueberries were really sweet.
I'll be going back soon...maybe tomorrow!

This place is awesome!
Just like the one @ Town Square this place is super clean and fun.
Seems larger than the TS location and is inside the same shopping center as the LVAC and starbucks off the 215 and eastern exit.
The yogurt tastes like fresh ice cream and the store is super convenient.

Must try.
Only thing I find wrong with it is that sometimes they rotate flavors out, so your favorite flavor may be gone one day and there the next.
I've asked and I think they said its a weekly thing(?).
Next to Saigon 8 and LVAC

LOVE the red velvet cake flavor, taste better than the real thing!
I was a devoted goldenspoon girl, and now I'm addicted to yogurtland.
It's like crack, sooo good, and not as expensive.

This place rocks!
I love bringing my kids to this frozen yogurt establishment.
It's inexpensive and the kids get to decide what they want.
I love the taste of the yogurt.
I like the outdoor seating, which is perfect for hanging out there a little bit longer in the evenings.

It was good!
Better than U-Swirl and as good, if not a bit better than Golden Spoon.
It was really clean, which I am picky about b/c well, self serve makes me cringe a bit to be honest..but all the toppings looked fresh and they were super neat, not all mixed together by people with unsteady spoons!
My son and I went, and while he is still a munchkin for both my Chocolate yogurt with mini PB cups combination and his Vanilla with "M's" as he calls M and M's it was $3.37..and I felt like I had a very full cup.
Pretty busy on a Tuesday night but not overally slammed...Yogurt was creamy..we will be back!
There spoons are really awesome too..not all flimsy, like really cool green spoons!
Yes..Im weird..deal;)

You gotta love when trends come back in.
I remember the 90's frozen yogurt craze.
Hell they even devoted a Seinfeld episode to it!
I see tons of froyo and cupcake places popping up.
Most of them are just trying to catch the streak du jour.
Yogurtland seems to have it down to a science.
You need four things to be the froyo king.
Location.
(215 & Eastern) not gonna be much more convenient than that.
Cost (.30 cents an ounce) might as well be free!
Variety (between the dozens of flavors they rotate and the hundreds of toppings, you can't get bored)  4.
Volume (you don't want any of number 3 above to sit for long)   This location has them all covered.
Great outside seating for a bonus!
We have had some challenges among friends to see who can get and eat the largest concoction.
($8 and change is the current leader)   Happy yogurting to you!

Ice cream move over, the yogurt is here to stay!
What I love about this place is variety of flavors and toppings.
I still don't get why you have to have candy, and processed cookies to go with the beautiful yogurt.
But then again, to ea.
its own.
I prefer my yogurt with simple mochis and that is all.

I like this location.
The employees are really nice, the equipment and counters are always clean, and I only ever get my froyo one way (tart froyo, strawberries, fruity pebbles, yogurt chips, & condense milk) and it's still pretty cheap.
No complaints!
I try and visit at least once a week with my little sister.

This was our 1st visit to Yogurtland in LV.
We've been to Yogurtland in Hawaii & Cali...I would like to say that the location on 215/Eastern is the best one!
only because its finally in our side of town LOL  It was fairly crowded with such a diverse crowd.
Yogurt back in the day was pretty much reserved for the health nuts, but these days it looks as if everyone is a health nut.
But for good reason...this yogurt is ONO and better for you than ice cream-unless you douse your yogurt with M&M's.
For as crowded as it was, it was clean.
The yogurt and toppings area were both very clean.
One employee would man the register and the other one would clean the yogurt and topping areas.
After clearing out the line of customers the cashier would replenish the toppings area and the cups.
Those two employees had mad teamwork skills...and they were also friendly.
They have a wide variety of flavors and toppings.
A lot of people were going for the taro flavor but I went for the plain with strawberries and almonds.
My wife had the pistachio w mochi & Our kids picked the cookies & cream w m&m;s.They were all good.
If you are overwhelmed by the amount of flavors just ask for a sample they'll gladly give you a bunch of tiny cups to try out their  many flavors.
The yogurt is also cheap, not like that P*nk B*rry place.
Although it's cheap, the store isn't cheap looking.
Its bright and colorful.
The walls are colored with green and white tiles throughout the store.They also had about 6 tables, 3-4 chairs each on the inside and a few tables on the outside.
There is also a water machine that they flavor with fresh fruits, last night it was strawberry.
So skip that 30 something flavors ice cream joint and eat something much better for your health but just as tasty.
Why are you still reading this?
Get in your car and head down there...PRONTO!!
Mahalo very much!

I love Yogurtland.
I love everything about Yogurtland- from the extensive choices of toppings and yogurt flavors to the fun d√©cor.
I especially love the DIY factor, so I can decide how much yogurt I want to eat on that particular visit.
Yogurtland satisfies my sweet tooth while being healthier and cheaper than other dessert options.
Whenever I go to Yogurtland, I fill my cup with the tart yogurt flavors as I find non-tart flavors to be too sweet for me.
My favorite yogurt flavor is Plain Tart.
After filling my cup with yogurt, I move to the toppings station.
I have to have three toppings on my yogurt to be happy: 1) Brownie Bites- chewy morsels of chocolately goodness; 2) Cheesecake Bites- absolutely perfect; and 3) Mochi.
Surprisingly, these toppings match well with the tart yogurt.
Sometimes I like to add strawberries and other fruit to my yogurt if they look fresh.
Usually, the cost of my cup of yogurt is under two dollars.
I like the location of this Yogurtland because the workers are friendly.
Also, there is ample indoor seating along with outdoor seating; however, this location can get crowded (usually at night after dinner) so be prepared to be on the lookout for an empty table.
I've been to all of the Yogurtlands in Las Vegas, and this location is my favorite.

YUMMMY!
I love this place.
Ok, I usually go here right after the gym (its in the gyms parking lot)  Sneaky buggers.
Taking advantage of our glucose deprived bodies!
Still....its a small frozen yogurt place with about 10-12 different frozen yogurts to choose from.
Some are always there and some flavors rotate out.
It is also a serve yourself kind of place.
Take a bowl and go wild my friends!
Once you have filled up with your favorite yogurts then head over to the topping section.
Here is where you can kick it up a knotch.
BAM!
Blueberries.
BAM!
Cheesecake peices.
BAM....anything you want.
Dreams are coming true!
But, with dreams comes a price.
Depending on your yogurt consumability you could set yourself back a couple bucks for sure.
But usually for two of us we get out for under $8.
Not to bad when we are talking about building dreams here my friends....not too bad.

Big fan of Yogurtland...they are definitely better than Golden Spoon!
They always have great flavors that they keep in rotation which is nice because I like to always change it up...like my women!!!
haha j/k :)  I luv the holiday flavors...especially the pumpkin pie yogurt!
Give this place a try and I promise, you will be hooked!
Cheers!

Amazing...So happy they brought back the red velvet cake batter!
All of their flavors are so close to the real thing!
Good texture...better than other yogurt places like USwirl and Golden Spoon.
I really like that you get to put on your own toppings.
And try as many flavors as you want.
It's really a guilt free way to satisfy your sweet tooth.
Great idea!
Wish I could afford a franchise!
LOL!

There seems to be a bleach odor that resides at this location.
Yogurtland is Yogurtland - delicious regardless of location :)

YOGURTLAND!
My friend and I have been in search of yogurtland this whole month of March.
From SF to LA, and from SF to LV we finally came to this stop.
I LOVE the selection of flavors (although, they don't have any non-dairy... sorry vegans) and toppings!
This is the cheapest froyo per oz I've seen so far.
I want to go back so badly.
I love you yogurtland!

Nothing different from the one at home.
I like that they had the Nilla Wafer flavor the time that we came.
That's almost as standard and as perfect as vanilla, to me.
I love mixing in all kind of fruit and things.
It reminds me of a strawberry shortcake almost.
I love that I can get as much or as little as I want.
The drive over here from the Encore was a tad long but it was worth it.
The flavors and things are the same back home but the nilla wafer sundae that I made for myself made it that much better.

It's a yogurtland.
And it had my favorites, tarts!
Which I can hardly ever find in San Diego anymore.
To top it off, they have a honeycomb tart that will rock your world!
I wanted to bring the location home in my pocket!
I might go back to Vegas just for yogurtland.
Ok, maybe for more than that, but you get my meaning.

I have a friend who would live off of yogurtland if she could.
However, I am not as impressed.
It's good yogurt, but it's nothing spectacular.
That being said, there is excellent service here and a fun, friendly environment.
I can't eat a lot of frozen yogurt, so I love the fact that you can choose how much yogurt you want, and pay by the ounce.
The cheesecake bites and brownie bites are quite yummy, and the yogurt is as good as any of the other frozen yogurt places around town, no better, no worse, just good yogurt.

Parking was a pain but the best selection I have found so far

Yummy!
I think I have been to every single Yogurtland location in town and this one is just as fab as the others.
It was semi-packed on a Thursday afternoon.
I'm assuming it was because of the Spring Break holiday.
I mixed pistachio, toasted coconut, and taro (absolutely delish), and it was a breathtaking mixture.
They had lots of toppings, although the fruit toppings looked a tad limp and not so fresh.
They have outside seating as well was inside seating, which is going to be really nice when we get our Vegas sun back.
I love Yogurtland!

I like the fact it tastes more natural than artificial with the flavors.

I think I may have inhaled too many brownie bites from Yogurtland at the time of my first review.
I don't know why I gave my favorite frozen yogurt place only 4 stars when it clearly deserves 5.
I tried the Key Lime Tart flavor recently- it's really yummy.
Try it.
It's perfect for summer!

What goes good with hot weather, yogurt & fresh fruit!
My family and I frequently visit yogurt land at least once a week.
Its a good dessert, I love the fresh fruits.
I think I get more fruits than yogurt.

My favorite thing to eat for dinner!
Fresh strawberries, blueberries Vanilla bean yogurt and strawberry yogurt is delicious.
I'm not into the tart flavors, but my wife loves them.
They had kona coffee for a little while and it was delicious, I hope they bring it back soon.

I stopped by here before my chiropractor appointment today because it felt like we were living on the surface of the sun.
SO GLAD I DID.
Its one of those serve yourself and they charge by the ounce places...which can really add up quickly.
I knew from experience to take it easy otherwise I would have a $12 frozen yogurt.
Their flavors were so yummy and they give out lots of sample cups.
I finally opted for the pecan praline, madagascar vanilla bean and caramel nut bar blend.
It was so creamy, so tasty and pretty much guilt free....how could you not like that?!?
My yogurt came to $3.24, which is very reasonable for those types of places.
The girl behind the counter was really sweet too.
Will be back every other week before my adjustment....there is something so soothing about the yogurt while your muscles are being loosened up by electric shock.

Good texture and flavor, didn't seem too pricey, but I'd probably rate my experience at the Red Mango location in the Miracle Mile Shops higher even though that one definitely cost more.

YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY in my tummy!!!!
I used to think that i only had chocolate loving taste buds but now adays i crave tart flavored anything!
So where do ya go when your craving tart flavored yogurt?!
YOGURTLAND!!
They usually have at least 3 tart flavors to choose from that are super delicious and will make your mouth pucker in delight.
Today i chose plain tart, guava papaya, dragon passion and taro (not a tart flavor but super good).
I didn't put any toppings on this time because I had homemade flax seed granola from whole food waiting at home that goes perfectly with this yogurt however, Yogurtland had tons of fresh fruit toppings and every candy topping you could ask for.
It's a sin this place is in the same parking lot at LVAC, what a waste of a workout when you find yourself sneaking in here after sweating your butt off right?

Red Velvet Cake Batter and you don't have to feel guilty...

I'm originally from California and I'm definitely happy that Vegas has multiple Yogurtland locations here.
This location is pretty much the same as all other locations.
I just wish this location had Mango.
One thing I've noticed is Vegas Yogurtland locations do not have popping boba, which almost all locations in California have.

"What kind of candy store serves up froyo?
"  That quote from my daughter is an indication of how often we release her into the wild.
It also shows how often she goes to candy stores (thanks, grandma).
Every time she comes here, she gets two bowls.
One for the yogurt, the other for the, wait for it...candy.
Yup.
And I'll give you one guess which bowl weighs more.
A small dollop of cookies and cream or mint chocolate and a heaping amount of brownie bites, mochi, gummy bears, M&Ms, chocolate chip cookies, oreo pieces, chocolate chips, nerds and whatever else tickles her tastebuds.
I think her bowls usually end up costing me $5 (or more if mom and grandma do the portioning).
Comparatively, my bowls usually have zero toppings and come out to just over $2.
Froyo joint or candy bar?
Your choice, but this place has a little of everything to please everyone.

My first time at this branch of Yogurtland.
It was the perfect end to a nice Lebanese dinner with a half-Lebanese friend in Henderson, her neck of the woods.
Like all the other Yogurtlands I've been to, this has the same delicious froyo, and the same wonderful toppings that I never try (!).
This branch has a decent amount of outdoor seating.
Too bad it was way too hot to take advantage of it.
I like the cute Hello Kitty spoons that have bumped up my collection to use at home.
A long-ago boyfriend taught me to never eat ice cream with metal spoons; they're just too cold and destroy the sensuality of the experience.
That's one lesson I've never forgotten, and Yogurtland is keeping me supplied!

Easily my fave froyo spot in town.
They do tart flavors right!
And the toppings are always stocked and fresh.
The employees are really friendly and offer all the samples you want.
I almost always get the same mix of strawberry, vanilla, and plain tart, never disappoints!
But the seasonal pumpkin pie I tried today was deelish!
I will definitely be back for more before its gone.
The only thing I dread is parking/driving in their crazy packed lot.
It never seems to matter what time I go.
Sometimes I end up parking all the way near the gym, but I can't complain.
The extra steps from the car to their door make me feel better about all the yummy goodness that I pack into their giant cups.
p.s.
i LOVE those Hello Kitty spoons!

So I quit smoking two weeks ago and I've been fixing on yogurtland ever since.
I love it.
Tart with white chocolate is my favorite.
I absolutely love this place, the people that work there, and the giant pleather green couch is lovable too.
I tried to make a heart but yelp doesn't allow characters in reviews.
(And there is a frown face next to that.
Really?

Our family loves frozen treats.
Yogurtland is now our go to place.
We end up here at least once a week and much more often in the hot summer months.
They have a wonderful selection of flavors and new featured flavors are offered regularly.
My favorite is red velvet.
It is terrific.
The topping selection is great too.
As a bonus, the spoons are colorful and cute.
The kids also like to get the complimentary strawberry flavored water thats available.
Nice since its free and its the only option available to drink.
Pricing is very reasonable per ounce, since its self serve its fantastic for the kids as you only pay for what you are going to eat.
Plus, you can always go back for seconds, right?
Yogurtland is very clean and bright with a hip feel.
I just wish that they had more seating available, there's 5 or 6 small round tables max inside and 5 or 6 outside.

the red velvet yogurt is stellar!

My favorite frozen yogurt place around.
There's a large selection of self serve flavors and condiments.
My favorite is Taro yogurt with Red Bean topping, maybe add a few Cap'n Crunch pieces for crisp texture.
Red Beans are almost like candy in Asia... it's so nice to have a healthy but sweet topping available.
No other frozen yogurt place offers it.
You pay by the ounce, not by the item.
My only caveat is that the staff should know when it's OK to kick someone out.
About a year ago there was an obviously stoned/drunk person sitting there in a daze with drool dripping out of his mouth... then a few minutes later he barfed all over the place.
Not a pleasant sight to see when you're eating yogurt, and that incident turned me off from yogurt for the good part of a year.

I just love this shop!
It's my first choice for some fro yo love.
With a creative and indecisive mind like mind, I just have to have a place that stretch the assortment boundaries!
Mounts of fro yo flavor assortments here!
Right now, I'm on this crazy Guava Pineapple Tart and Mango Mixer obsession.
The tropical flavors have me feeling exotic!
As if I'm supposed to inherit some sort of Caribbean accent after eating a cup of these delectable delights.
Usually, I'm craving the red velvet which is my yogurt of choice when I stop by, but lately I just had to take a break and give myself some variety.
You know, expand my horizons.
Topping selection here is endless!
Candy!
M&Ms, Reeces Pieces, fruits, syrup, gall-or!
They also charge by the ounce which I am completely thankful for because I don't feel so pressured to choose just one or two.
I can combine however many I want.
It makes for agcreat opportunity to test my creative culinary skills.
;)  My culinary skills stop here after the topping picks though.

Pros: Good fro yo, lots of fresh fruit (among other things), always have tart as a flavor.
Cons: Some flavors are pretty average, not as creamy as golden spoon (but clearly a different business model).

All Aboard on the Love Train.
Contrary to my usual grumpiness, I gotta admit, I like this place.
It is simple, clean, and I decide how much and what I spoon into my bowl, WITHOUT always doing a visual price check and fast computation that I do at other places.
The format is be a glutton or be cautious but you just don't know the final tally until you weigh in.
Great concept.
The KISS method, Keep It Simple, Stupid.
And it works.
P.S.
And you get little sample mini cups to sample a flavor you might be wondering about or didn't even know you were hankering for.
And if you keep going back in line you can fill up BEFORE you fill your OWN cup.
I mean, at least that's what I've heard people do.

I love to get some frozen treats at this location after having Pho next door.
It cools me down and satisfy my craving for sweets after delicious pho .
My favorite condiments are pecan and taro.
I like the concept that you can put as many as different flavors of yogurts in your cup with different varieties of toppings.
So you can try all the flavors in small amount.
It's healthier to have yogurt than ice cream.
That's my excuse to have some yogurts after a meal!

Great tasting.
As many do, I chose to mix at least two flavors.
If you fill the cup and top with many goodies do expect the price to be much more than you would have guessed.
Overall, goodness can be had for a more modest amount of yogurt and a sprinkled topping which means your savings can be used for a return visit or two !

Its a DIY frozen yogurt place with loads of innovative flavors and great toppings.
I always opt for the not so exciting original tart (which is so so good with fresh strawberries and chocolate).
The reason Yogurtland deserves a 5 is that they totally don't rip you off for yogurt.
Its frozen yogurt for goodness sake- no reason to charge some ridiculous amount.. Plus if I want one strawberry on my yogurt (or something equally as crazy) I can put whatever I want on my yogurt.
What's not to love?

What can I say ?
Delicious ~ Creative ~ Fresh Toppings ~ A one of a kind treat every time !

Alright, so here's the deal...if you need something cool and sweet to beat the heat, then check out Yogurtland!
(Whoa, I'm a poet and didn't even know it!
ha ha) OK, but seriously, walk in, get sample cups from the person at the register, and try as many flavors as you want!
Some are tart, some are sweet, some are fruity, and some are, well, different (Taro anyone?!).
I like that you get to sample, pick your flavors, and fill your own cup with as much or as little as you want.
Once your cup is full, then comes the fun part...toppings!
They have lots of fresh fruit, all kinds of candies and nuts, some crushed up cookies, and those little fruit balls that look like fish eggs...if you've never had them, you should try them...they're kinda interesting!
My go to flavors are French Vanilla, Cheesecake, and Strawberry.
Not super exciting, but always good!
For toppings, I get brownie squares, cookie dough balls, Reese's peanut butter cups, and/or miniature M&Ms.
Oh, and sometimes I get crushed up Oreo's or some kind of fresh fruit.
They charge by weight and usually if I fill it half way with yogurt and throw some toppings on there, it comes out to around $5.00...not too bad a deal.
If you're a member of LVAC, show your card and you'll get 10% off!
Check 'em out next time you're near Eastern and craving a cool treat...you can thank me later!

Freakin' Love this Place!
Be cautions though-absolutely addictive!
I use to be a fan of Red Mango, but the change flavors often and when I find something I like it's not available when I go back in.
Not to mention it's not self serve and it really depends on whose working behind the counter on how generous they are with helpings.
Yogurtland eliminates those problems with the self serve and it's cheaper than Red Mango even when I top off my cup!
Not to mention the yogurt is better tasting, even the tart flavor.
Speaking of flavors...they always have my favorites.
The only problem is that i can't fit all of them in a cup on one visit-I guess I'll have to come back tomorrow to get what I missed out on...and I know it'll be there!!!
-Ryan  PS also much better than U-Swirl and Josie's...way better tasting than either one.

Tons of yummy flavors.
I chose to mix fresh strawberry, dutch chocolate(yummy) and french vanilla with some fresh strawberries, brownie bits and slivered almonds and had a yummy desert.
Love the hello kitty spoons used to eat the yogurt.
They have several toppings available including crumbled oreo cookies, all kinds of chocolate chips ad other yummy treats as well as some fresh fruit.
You can ask for sample cups to taste the flavors before deciding.
The staff is friendly and the place was quite busy even at closing time.
I used a coupon for 3 oz free and just paid $1.50 for the yogurt that day.
Will go and check other flavors as well.
Good choice if you like sweet stuff but not overly sweet and heavy deserts.

One of the top yogurt places I know, better than Pinkberry, Red Mango, 16 handles, etc.
Wins in price, number of flavors, decor, and quality.
Rather than review the yogurt, I'll share with you what I do with my friends:  Before checkout, we guess the prices of the yogurts.
The one closest to the actual price wins and the loser pays for both yogurt.
You win some, you lose some, but it's worth it.

I love yogurt and this Yogurtland has never let me down.
First off, it's self serve so I can put on as many toppings as I want.
YUMMMY!!!!
The employees keep the topping bar well stocked and clean and the fruits are always fresh.
I don't find the prices to be unreasonable it's based on how many ounces you get so it's really up to you on how much you are going to pay.
I am a topping lover and therefore tend to go pretty heavy on toppings but I usually end up paying around 6 dollars for a pretty descent portion.
I also always get the regular tart flavor as I like how the tartness counteracts the sweetness from the toppings.
The only downsides are that for some reason the yogurt comes out REALLY SLOW and takes a little time to fill my container and the parking is awful, but neither one stops me from going.

Wooo how can you go wrong with fro-yo at 35 cents an announce?
This place is delicious.
There is a big variety of yogurts you can pick from.
My faves are the pistachio and red velvet (yeah its everyone's favorite) but for real they are good.
They of course have the standard vanilla, chocolate, along with several tart flavors which I can never get into.
They switch the flavors up constantly so there is plenty of variety.
But what really makes the place is the fact they have a ton of toppings to choose from.
Fresh fruit, candy, sprinkles, EVERYTHING.
Pile on cookie dough, gummy worms, or cheesecake if you have a sweet tooth, or you can keep it healthy with strawberries, lychee, or whatever fruit you want.
One of these days I am gonna go in just for the toppings.
The best thing about the place is of course the price.
You can come out spending less than 4 bucks with a ton of fro-yo.
Its a much better deal than the $8-9 bucks you would spend at cold stone.

They are currently serving flavors of the world at Yogurtland - with unique and special tastes!
For a quick cold yummy treat, Yogurtland is our favorite place!!
I'm always a sucker for the Cheesecake yogurt with strawberry toppings.
But on this visit I tried the new Toffee Pudding (I was a bit disappointed in this flavor) and the Triple Chocolate.
Topped with butterfinger candy bits and mini M&M's, a chocolate lover can go nuts here with the topping selections!
From my visits to other FroYo/Custard places in town, we prefer Yogurtland for their wider variety of selections and toppings.
Always a good time here!

We are addicted to this yogurt.
I'm pretty sure we are putting the owners children through college.

Self serve frozen yogurt is one of those guilty pleasures of mine.
It's almost up there with the music by Milli Vanilli.
Naw, joke only.
Or, is it?
I admit, I have avoided a Yogurtland for quite some time.
My little girl and my nephew both had complaints about one in California.
Their complaints...their froyo tasted like crap.
You know what I'm thinking.
If kids don't love it, then why wouldn't eitherI.
Then I started seeing all these check in's, comments, and reviews about Yogurtland.
Okay, I think it's time to give them a shot.
As a post-workout treat, I came here with our normal crew Chad S, Shirley B, and of course Terri R.  This place was busy.
But since it's self serve, the line is only as long as you're going to take.
My choice was simple..their Oreo Cookies and Cream, NY Cheesecake, and Black Sesame Vanilla.
I topped it off with some granola and peanut butter chips.
After my first, second, and last bites, I totally forgot about my daughter's complaints about this place.
In my opinion, this was some of the best frozen yogurt I've ever had.
I got three flavors just in case I was disappointed in one of them.
I wasn't and ended up eating the whole thing.
I know I can't be doing this daily or even once a week if I want to cut some pounds.
But when I'm in the mood or must have me some froyo, Yogurtland is where you'll find me.

Not often get me some dessert but after night with asian persuasion crew plus workout in early.
Hot summer vegas days beckoning on us.
Hell yay could use some dessert too end the night.
It was the first time at this location but been too other ones.
The thing love about is that all self service, they tend too mix up the flavors often enough keep it new, and like the topping that they offer (especially fan of the mochi balls; truth not the read deal ones like back home in Hawaii but will do).
The only danger would say is keep in mind the more stuff put the more you pay.
It all goes by weight.
The flavors not much too add too.
One thing that must say is this is perfect spot too people watch!
It located right next too LVAC and not just Yogurtland talk about diversity of restaurants all packed in same shopping plaza.
They have outdoor patio tables so not only relaxing on not so hot vegas day but get too see random people walking around too.
I notice people were hanging out with their pets outside too.

I love frozen yogurt!
There was a great variety of flavors to choose from as well as lots of fresh toppings.
I had Polynesian vanilla with fresh mango and mochi.... YUMMY!
Perfect on a warm day!
Well really anytime!

Froyo cravings are no joke.
After having lunch me and a few coworkers decided to head to Yogurtland to get some dessert.
I had had a serious tart yogurt craving for the last few days so I was definitely up for it.
They didn't have my favorite tart raspberry pomegranate flavor, but they did have some other tart options so I filled up on those.
I also tried the black sesame, which I wasn't really feeling.
I guess I'm just fanatical about tart.
They have tons of variety of toppings and the line is kept pretty clean, so I'm a fan.
Definitely a good Yogurtland in the area.

This place is great.
I loveeeee frozen yogurt.
It's really cheap too.
Since I like it plain I just full my cup and don't really like toppings so I skip those.
It's just like 3 dollars.
I'm obsessed with the original plain flavor.
It's SO good.
The other flavors are okay.
I've like some but none come close to the original flavor.
I'm sticking to that one.

Have been back many times.
Most of the employees are good natured.
For a small "hits-the-spot"  treat, filling up the cup too the rim will give plenty of yogurt to enjoy until next time.
Great place.

As if I didnt already love yogurtland enough (what's not to love?
Fresh ingredients,  unique flavors and a great price!
)  this last time we stopped by to cool off from the 110 degree heat the owner herself hooked ALL 3 of my kids up with Hello kitty-inspired summer bags,  collector hello kitty buttons and kid sized frisbees!
How awesome is that?

This place is awesome!
The employees are friendly, the place is always clean and well stocked.
Even if there's a line out the door, you'll be in and out pretty quickly.
Oh, and their flavors and toppings are pretty delicious too.

I am so disappointed with the flavors of yogurt here.
I have gone a few times and each time they do the same thing.
They have multiple variations of the same flavors.
This time there were two types of orange and I think two types of chocolate.
Plus, at least one of the sections had no flavors at all.
What a waste.
The toppings were ok, but they variety of sauces was also disappointing.
Two types of chocolate and a caramel.
I really love U-Swirl's selection, there are about 8 different flavors of sauces.

I don't know about anyone else... but man...this place gets better and better!

Great place for a post workout meal!
Everything is fresh.
Usually have everything but did not have blueberries this particular day!
Friendly staff.

Stopped by my local Yogurtland this evening and was helped by little miss Elena.
Her smile and cheerfulness was contagious and I told myself she needed some recognition.
It was a busy night there tonight, she had to deal with a lot of people, and she was so darn smiley.
She knows how to brighten a person's day!
When the line was finally over, she continued working hard cleaning.
Anyone would be lucky to have this girl work for them!
You go Elena!
(I hope I spelled your name correctly)  Also, Yogurtland is delicious.
I wish they'd have the mango flavor more often though!

This was a great Yogurtland!
Perhaps beating out the locations in Summerlin and Pacific Beach, California (both of which I frequent).
They had flavors I've never seen at either location, including Taro, Root Beer float, Apricot Tart, and an interesting flavor called Fruit Kaboom sorbet.
The coconut was less runny than both locations, but the flavor was weak.
PROS: -best kiwi I've ever had!
ripe, sweet, fresh.
some places don't even offer kiwi at all -strawberries were also good.
the fruit seemed fresh in general -very clean and good atmosphere (minus the music) -the flavors they offer are great, with good pairings for the swirls (apricot and tart, yum)  CONS: -music is horrible!
maybe they had bad luck with pandora, but either way I sat outside to get away from it -did not offer peanut butter :( -Runnin' Rebels Red Velvet, NSA strawberry cheesecake

LOVED IT!!!
The flavors are awesome.
With my favorite mix being: Coconut+Strawberry+Apricot Tart+Fresh Strawberries+Nila Waffers= Deliciousness.
Pricing is great as well, staff is friendly and place is clean.

Before Snowflake emerged as everyone's favorite dessert place, there was frozen yogurt.
Easy concept with different flavors of froyo and your choice of toppings.
You could pile your dessert with as much stuff as you want, and you pay by the ounce.
Depending on how elaborate your dessert is, you're looking at about $4-$6.
Not bad at all for a delicious and custom built dessert.
I have the hugest sweet tooth ever!!!
I'm surprised I don't weigh 150 lbs or have diabetes with all the sugar I eat.
So having a boyfriend who doesn't like desserts altogether was a bummer.
I guess it's a good thing when it comes to living a healthier lifestyle, but still.
We came here one night because I was once again craving a sweet treat after dinner, but didn't want the guilt of ice cream.
I always go for vanilla topped with popping pearls, blueberries when in season, and fruity pebbles.
John tried the pistachio with almonds and coconut flakes, and surprisingly, he liked it.
He said  it wasn't overly sweet like ice cream and liked that he could control the portions and toppings.
Guess I found our dessert spot.

We absolutely loved this place while we were in Vegas for vacation.
We came here probably 3-4 times.
Their flavors were pretty good.
At the time they had 'Looney Tunes' flavors, which was kind of a weird mix of flavors (you'll have to just go and check it out) but I went with standard flavors like strawberry, vanilla, or cheesecake (I know, not super standard but I've seen it at other frozen yogurt places).
Their toppings were pretty standard too, my favorite being cheesecake pieces, graham cracker crumbs and granola.
We're from New England and every yogurt place can get pricey.
A conservative serving would still run you about $7-8 but Yogurtland is about half the price which was why we ate there after dinner often.

This yogurtland is a always a must after my family and I grab pho next door.
The place is always clean, well stocked with condiments, and the service is always quick to smile and friendly.
(I'd be happy too if I worked in a yogurt shop).
Not much else to say but this place always delivers consistent quality service and goods.
Service: ***** (5) Cleanliness: ***** (5) Selection: **** (4) Consistency: ***** (5)  Overall: ***** (5)  I'm a fan and will continue to give them my business.

One of the few locations with tables INSIDE (unlike the Town Square location).
Located right next to the 215 and Eastern.
Across from the LV Athletic Club (what a tease)   Clean.
Friendly Staff.
Currently priced at $0.39/oz.
My bias is toward tarts.
So i love plain tart, as well as the other tarts.
Good alternative place to go after dinner for dessert, down the street from the many restaurants, making you more stuffed than you already are.

I had never heard or seen a place that was like Yogurtland until I moved to Las Vegas.
I'm pretty sure it has changed my life.
While this is the closest location to me, it is also by far my favorite.
I have always had a great experience here with the staff and it is always very, very clean and well-stocked in the toppings bar.
It's also a very easy location to get in and out of (I usually leave out the back of this business complex as there is a driveway that goes onto Pebble instead of the oft-busy Eastern).
All the delicious flavors and toppings as well as being so very clean and efficient make this place an overall win for me.
When I have out-of-town friends, I try to take them here to show them the deliciousness - then they gripe at me once they go home and find themselves wanting more.
My favorite flavors so far are peanut butter, pistachio, taro and maple syrup - all super-delicious.
Cookies & cream is a great place to start if the other flavors sound a little too exotic for you.
Their vanilla and vanilla bean are also good.
For toppings, they have a little bit of everything - cereals, graham cracker crumbs, chocolate syrup, granola, gummy worms, nuts, cheesecake bites... You can go as healthy (or as unhealthy) as you want.
One of my favorite combos is peanut butter yogurt + Reese's bites + walnuts + peanut butter.
Yes, I may have an obsession with peanut butter.
Now that they have a Loyalty Card, it's great to go with friends who don't have one - double the points in one visit!
Haha.
There was a point in time where I'd visit at least once a week, sometimes more.
Thankfully, I've weaned myself away from it enough to only go perhaps once a month.
But Yogurtland will forever and always has a special place in my sweet tooth.

Best frozen Yogurt I've ever had!
They always have a good variety of flavors that have never been runny and a lot of toppings, it's always clean, and the workers are friendly.

It smells in here.
Like mop water.
All the time.
The yogurt is good but the smell is so unappetizing.
It makes me feel like it's not clean or sanitary here.
I feel like having your establishment not smell, especially when it's so small, is basic.

This little place is just the perfect place to chat with your girlfriends and catch up.
They offer such a wide variety of unique flavors and toppings.
The place itself is very quaint and adorable.
It gets very crowded at times though, especially at nights.
I mean, who doesn't crave frozen yogurt at night?
No one's judging.
Also, they have seats outside the store- which is great especially when the weather outside is just perfect.
The place is quite clean.
Now onto the idea of customizing your own frozen yogurt.
I just love the idea- its simple and fun.
This place is very kid friendly and family friendly.
Service is not bad and not good either, but everything else makes up for it.
The price I believe is $0.32/oz.
My ultimate favorite by far is the pistachio topped with mochi, condensed milk, and strawberries- definitely obsessed with that combo!
Enjoy.

My favorite place to get frozen yogurt for these simple reasons:  clean ambiance, great selection of yogurt flavors, all flavors are delicious, and very affordable (if you don't go crazy with the toppings which I sometimes do haha)

Taro yogurt on point!!!!
Also my go to is the tart yogurt.
Toppings ate yummy, clean place, great service.

I don't love this place as much as my hubby does.
I'm not a fan of the self service and I genuinely miss my old yogurt spot that is now closed.
The flavors don't taste as natural to me.
However every time we go in I sample a flavor or two hoping today will be the day I decide to buy one for myself.
On A recent visit I tried the Dubai flavor which was a vanilla date shake.
It was good but I would have preferred a stronger date flavor.
I'm not thrilled with the customer service, cleanliness or decor, sometimes it's nice inside other times it's pretty gross.
I dislike  eating inside here.

Triple love it.
So thrilled they are putting one in Green Valley can't wait!
I hope they offer my favorites I love the tarts.
The eastern location always has a least one tart flavor.
Yum.

Make sure they handed you the plastic spoons & not shoved its in your weighing bowl, because its literally can cause you extra $1

Gotta love good Froyo!!
The flavors are always rotating in here.
Enough to allow you to try some of all the flavors that pique your interest on their website, but not often enough to make you scramble and cry because your favorite it gone and gone forever.
This location is very clean.
And the toppings are usually full to the top.
Outside seating that is offered as well as their indoor seating bought this joint an extra star.
Only 4:5 because of the staff.
Generally ALWAYS rude and blow you off.
Had a crew cleaning half hour before close, stood in our way so we couldn't get to the bowls and machines because they were in the middle of cleaning....
Uh ok?
Then waited for them at the register and when they did come over they didn't say two words.
Just swiped our card, handed us spoons and that was that.
The second time, the girl as the register was standing there chatting up her friend who was at the register for so long that the line backed up about ten people long and my 2 year olds ice cream was half melted by the time I was able to pay.
Product and cleanliness and price: A+ Staff: D-

Clean and gReat service!
The fruit is fresh and there are a lot of flavors to choose from!

Coconut yogurt topped with strawberries,  banana and cheesecake bites is my favorite!
Great customer service and always clean
