My Vespa was in storage for a couple years and needed some minor tune-ups to drive again.
So I called AAA and requested a tow, to bring my scooter to a repair location.
Joe from Western Towing, showed up as expected and right on time.
He was extremely friendly!
He was very considerate and careful to load my bike onto the flatbed without causing any harm.
I was very, very pleased with the service!
I think most of my previous towing experiences involve waiting long, excessive amounts of time.
Not with Western Towing -- they were fast, friendly, and professional!

Used their service for an emergency, was referred by Nissan.
They were quick and polite!
I was impressed by the service !

This is by far the worst towing company in arizona.
In the process of towing my car onto their flatbed they twisted my chassis and completely shattered my back window.
The fat a** kid who towed my car apparently didn't know what he was doing and didnt notice what he had done.
I've submitted a claim the day they towed my vehicle and was told someone would get back to me within 7-10 business days.
Two weeks passed and no call.
i tried calling their corporate office, left several messages and still no response!
Ive tried talking to their hr department and all they told me was i have to talk to claims.
This company is so shady and so unprofessional with no respect for personal property.
