I've been here coupla times in the past week or so.
It's a nice clean store, nothing special, pretty helpful clerks, good selection, average prices.
There is a nice big parking lot so you can always park close.

Eh, it's in Mesa.
Overall pretty clean, helpful employees.
I can't speak for the pharmacy though.

I come to this pharmacy often, not by choice.
The prescription for my son can only be filled here if I want my insurance to pay for it.
So every other week I'm forced to reserve time I don't really have available to go stand in a long line to deal with stupid employees that can never seem to get anything right and to top it off they all have attitudes.
Their prices are high and the employees are rude.
The only good thing about this place is the cleanliness... its always clean and organized.

I've always had good service at the pharmacy and the staff has always been so nice overall; my concern is that the outdated decor and lack of clean floors near pharmacy is going to drag down the much needed improvements in the newly appointed Fiest a District.
The nearby businesses seem to be joining in by updating their facades or cleaning up surrounding landscapes.
Every time I go to this store I feel like i'm in a time warp.
I hope they join this modern time and spruce up the place!
