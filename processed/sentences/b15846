I love their chicken soft tacos!!
The best ever.
They are good for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
Yum.

Once upon a time, this was the only Del Taco that was near my house.
I would drive 10+ minutes out of my way to stop here....ahh the college years were always good times.
Now, I only stop here when I'm in the area and need to find a quick bite to satisfy my growling stomach.
It can get pretty crowded during the lunch rush, so I try to avoid it if possible.
Their speed, accuracy, and quality is about par with other Del Taco restaurants.
I enjoy the Big Fat Chicken Tacos and Veggie Works Burritos.
Will I return?
Sure.

Great drunken food.

Great management at this location.
Orders are fast and accurate.
Its the little things that make the difference.

Leckere mexikanische Küche als Fast food.
Bestellung ging schnell und essen War in Ordnung.
Würde ich würde hin.

One of the best managers around.
Keep up the good work!

I like Del Taco in general, but I won't be going back to this location.
I ordered a bean and cheese burrito with no sauce, but they gave me one with sauce.
The tortilla was hard and it looked like it had been sitting for awhile.
I also had to wait for them to come back to the window for part of my order that they forgot.

Wanted to start off day with a good meal, dropped by del taco never at breakfast here before.
The food was fresh the service amazing.
Thanks del taco for making me full and happy and ready to start day.
