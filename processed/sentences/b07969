Office max has officially lost my business.
They advertised "WE HAVE YOUR INK" well when I go in to get my ink guess what ?
They don't have my ink.
They don't carry Dell ink !
Office Max brand ink that would have been comparable and usable guess what ?
They don't carry my series number ( 21 ) only up to 11.
I went to Staples and not only did they have a great selection of Dell ink but they had my ink !
I was in and out of the store in less than two minutes !

I ordered a Serta office chair at the store, was told the chair would be delivered in 1 to 3 business days.
I am now on day seven, and no one can tell me where the chair is or when it will be delivered.
In this day and  age of instant access to incredible amounts of information a company that is in the business of selling information related items, affiliates themselves with an organization that cant track their item, does not deserve your business.
Go somewhere else, for your office needs, or make sure you leave the store with your items.

Standard Office Max store in terms of products, but the staff is great and the store usually doesn't have many customers.
When I had to wait behind people in line they opened up a new register.
Parking is a breeze.
Very friendly and convenient overall.

I had good experiences with the employees, but this store is expensive.
This is about the only store open in the entire Metro Power Center facing Dunlap and its kind of strange.
Overall, you cant beat their prices on printing.
The local library nearby was closing and was not helpful so I had to walk all the way down here and they actually looked up my document on my flash drive and printed it out for 10 cents per-page instead of the libraries' 20 cent price.
