We stop in this QT every time we pass by, which varies from a few times a month to months in between.
It's on our way to play baseball some 60 miles from home.
The people here are friendlier than average, even moreso than most QTs.

This QT is best in my book!
Well ran, very friendly and extremely efficient staff.
I can truly appreciate the way that this store is ran.
Well done!

I only wish they sold 8-10lb bags of their crushed ice.
Convenient spot for lottery tickets.

People here are way more intelligent then circle k damn.
