Active Lifestyle?
Ck it out!
I always find deals on shoes for hiking, running, walking.
Sales are great.
When I ck similar products at other sport stores, Big 5 always seems to have better sales & discounts.
Staff always available to help & assist.
Returns and exchanges have been painless.
I'll be back as soon as I wear out my next runners :-)

Big 5 gets five stars....because it is the only place in the valley that I have consistently found Fila shoes for a great price....enough said.

I am a fan of this place because of its prices.
We had one sales associate who was worthless when it came time to help us, however we came across another guy who made up for it.
My one complaint was how cramped this store is.
Its packed with stuff and hard to manuver around.
Again, the prices made up for any mis-haps along the shopping way and was pleased when my son's soccer kleets were only 17$, originally 32$.

Customer service is less that steller.
Had to chase someone down to get assistance with a pair of shoes.
The floor associate made it clear via his facial expressions, that he didn't want to be there, and he didn't really care if he helped anyone or not.
