The customer service was great.
The problem is that I paid $400 for mink eyelash extensions.
I repeatedly stated that I was going for fullness and that I did not want long lashes.
When she was finished she started explaining why "she" selected the length that she did (which was longer than I wanted) and she also explained why she selected a certain diameter lash and a lash that stretched out rather than curled.
Now, I did not know that all of these options were available and for $400 you would think she would have included me in making these decisions rather than risk me leaving dissatisfied.
Basically she went with what she liked rather than ask what I wanted.
I wasted $400 because I am embarrassed by the long outstretched lashes.
If she had listened to me it would have been a shorter lash and if she would have asked me I would have opted for a curl rather than outstretched lashes.
They do good work, so if you go insist on being part of the decision making right upfront.
That should be a given.

I got mink eyelash extensions from here in January.
I have gotten two fills and I just love them.
Everyone tells me how natural they look.
I think I'm addicted!
My fair eyelashes now look black and thick 24 hours a day and I can't even feel them they're so light.
I wish they were my real eyelashes, but then again, no one would ever know they weren't!!
The technician is very experienced, she treats it like an art, and she only uses the best products.
I'm very happy and my husband who was skeptical at first is happy too, especially because it now takes me half as long to do my makeup and to wash my face.
