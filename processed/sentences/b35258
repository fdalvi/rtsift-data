I was looking for cupcakes and found those.. good but the cannolies took the cake (no pun intended).. t/y Palma!

This is not Rachel's bake shop anymore.
She as moved.
Read my review under Palma Riccobono's.

Rachel's moved to 22209 S. Ellsworth Road in Queen Creek.
I am glad I found her new shop because her bakery items are wonderful!
BTW, phone number is 480-703-9641
