I couldn't help but go into this shop when I was walking by.
As all cooking enthusiasts should know, Aga is the royalty of cookers, stoves and fridges.
However, as I ventured inside, lone be hold Aga actually sell more than this!
Indeed, inside the shop I was surrounded by gleaming Kitchen accessories!
From toasters to pots and pans, this Aga Shop had it all!
And once in a while in a shop you do imagine what that product would be like in my flat!?
And whilst I was in the Aga shop I couldn't help but think of my ideal kitchen and how it would be full of Aga products.
However, as a student, my bubble was soon burst when I started to look at the prices.
Aga products are expensive!!!!
But what a vision to have, that someday, you will be able to afford at least one Aga product!
If you want to dream of that future kitchen then Aga will be a source of inspiration!
