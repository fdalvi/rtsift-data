I've been using this cleaners for several years and spent quite a lot of money here.
Recently I noticed that all my shirts have staple like pin holes in the bottom of the back of the shirts.
First I called the owner to tell him and he yelled at me then hung up on me.
I then brought 12 shirts back to show him the holes.
He claims that's the way they tag the shirts and no one has complained in 20 years of him being in business.
I said that I understand that's his process but I still have holes in all of my shirts that his cleaners created.
He would not compensate me in any way and didn't care that he would lose my business.
