I have been going here for over two years.
I moved 30 minutes north, and I still make the trip to go to him because he is the best!
He is certified in pediatric and pregnancy.
I started coming here when I was pregnant with my second daughter.
I know he is also a certified sports chiropractor.
Kathy, in the front office, is one of my most favorite people ever!
She always has a friendly smile and is so helpful!
I also love Heidi, the massage therapist, who is there on Fridays!
I have recommended him to friends.
He is the best!
Update:  I left here when the main doctor left years ago.
Dr. Patrick Chivaroli was amazing!
I don't know where he went, but I definitely recommend him!
When he left, there was a girl chiropractor, and she was fine, but I didn't like her enough to keep making the 30 minute drive.
I now have a new chiro right near me in Tramonto who I love!

I went to Dr Kendra with a stiff neck and lower back pain.
I was totally surprised when I left after the first visit and could look "over my shoulder" to back out of my parking spot!
I haven't been able to do this in months!
She is a very caring doctor who called me after the visit to check on how I felt.
I can't wait to get back and continue treatment.

At my first visit I remember being very impressed with Dr. Marcus.
He really took his time with me, and as a result I felt completely safe and very confident in his ability to help me.
I was so thankful to him for taking the time to really explain what chiropractic adjustments do and what he would be testing me for specifically.
I had been experiencing back pain with certain movements, and after just one adjustment, I felt significant improvement.
His adjustments continue to keep me pain-free.
Also, Dr. Marcus is very personable and friendly, which is important to me when I look for practitioners.
I couldn't recommend him more!
