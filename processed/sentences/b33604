Was hoping to see Dr Lara Weiner at this location, but after I was told by the service rep that there were no appointmenst until mid-July!
I was shocked.
Forget it!
Geez, the cold I had would be gone by then.
I ended up going to the UMC quick care right next door and received great care!

My regular doctor was unable to see me last minute, so I was told to go UMC quick care.
No appointment necessary, they accept walk-ins.
I guess I just got lucky.
Upon arriving, I was the only one in the waiting room and was called to come in within a few minutes.
The nurse was friendly and informative and answered any and every questions I had, and I had Dr. Sepulveda.
He was an all-smiles guy, great sense of humor and quick.
I was in and out within 10-15 minutes.
After spending a few minutes with a happy person, you just cant help but turn into a happy person yourself... so, needless to say, I was in a better mood leaving than i was when I first came in.
Turns out i had an ear infection and sinus infection, so got my prescriptions and I was good to go!
If you want to be in and out quickly, I'd suggest going in around 9am or before 9:30... As I was on my way out, the lobby was half full.
Just my luck that I had gotten there just in time before it got crowded... yay me :)

My daughter spraigned her knee in a soccer match!!
YIKES.
Went here becuase it was the closest qucik care.
We got her in to the doc quickly and got an x-ray quickly.
they handled insurance paper work fast.
The reception area was small and cramped.
The service at the counter was professional and not friendly.
The medical staff was more friendly and very professional.
It was better than going to an emergency room - that is for sure.
