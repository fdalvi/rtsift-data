OMG, the ribs are the best!!!
Don't get them if you are way hungry though cuz there are about 5 finger size ribs but they are so tender and i heart them.

Love Burger King, though this particular location is far from my favorite.
Still, I find myself frequenting this one since it is the closest one to my girlfriend's house.
This location usually takes your order and gives it to you promptly and accurately, but there have been a few times when the staff have been a bit absent-minded.
On at least one occasion, I asked for onion rings in my meal instead of fries, and just ended up getting fries.
Another big complaint is that if you pay with a debit/credit card, they make you sign the receipt.
This is the ONLY Burger King I know of that does this; I have been to at least a dozen other locations in the valley and none of them do this.
If you're in the neighborhood this place will probably take care of you well, just be sure to double-check your order.

Always had good and fast service at this location.

I usually get friendly service here.
There is often at least one error in my orders, however.
This is ok as long as i eat in, which i often do since theres a HUGE, really nice indoor kids play area (which gets them an extra star!
) However , when going thru the drivethru, expect a wait, and CHECK YOUR ORDER!
Preferably before leaving the drivethru!

Just got out of this place after a 25 minute wait for two whoppers and a large fry...by far the worst BK I've been too...!!
