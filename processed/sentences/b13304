This was the worst experience that I've ever had with a refi...run away as fast as you can!
We opted to not go with the VA 4.25 they offered us and wanted a conventional refi....they tacked on fees that were in access of 16,000 dollars at a 4.5 rate...and that is with excellent credit.
AND they won't even give you true quotes unless you give them $400 via credit card to start the process.
We ended up using DLJ financial in California....they were up front, professional and DID NOT require crazy fees.
Our interest rate is way lower than what quicken quoted us and they responded to every email and phone call quickly.
I have no idea how they got rated #1 by JDPowers....RUN AWAY...and use a different company.

Spoke to them today about a HARP refinance and the experience was terrible.
Sounds like a bait and switch like the other reviewer suggested.
Spoke to someone names Byron (or was it Bryan).
He tried to bully/shame me into leaping into a loan without looking.
I told him they were the first company I'd talk to and it would be crazy for me not to check around a bit.
After telling me how he couldn't understand why I wasn't running for my checkbook to take advantage of his screaming deal (which subsequent research proved wasn't that great) he nearly hung up on me when I still resisted.
Ridiculous.

I have been trying to work with Quicken Loans for a while now and have very little to show for it.
I have to agree with fellow Yelpers Cindy A and E.J.
Their rates seem to be off and you don't always get someone who knows what they are talking about.
I really don't understand their JD Powers #1 rating given the level of misinformation.
Sorry!

I don't trust these folks at all.
I was contacted by Quicken when I signed up for Lending Tree (a big mistake, don't use Lending Tree).
When the agent called I told him I was looking for a 10 year re-finance, at a fixed rate.
I specifically told him I needed to know what the best rate and the costs would be.
It took several calls from the agent before he finally told me their rate and cost.
The rate was .1% higher than a competing lender and their costs were twice as much.
I told him I would go with the other, less expensive lender and then he got real aggressive, telling me that Quicken was the best lender in the business (yeah right).
Once I finally got him to understand that cost was the deciding factor he then recommended I let him review the loan docs.
from the other lender.
I didn't even know this guy, why would anyone let a stranger look over your loan docs?
After finally getting off the call, I started receiving repeated calls from another Quicken agent.
I finally took one of the calls to tell her to stop contacting me.
Since then the emails have been coming fast and furious, even when I replied asking them not to contact me at all.
One of the emails my request came from the original lending agent, saying something to the effect of, "call me and let's set up an appt.
to discuss your loan.
"  If you want to avoid being pestered indefinately, NEVER contact Quicken Loans.

I was contacted by my mortgage company (Seterus) to start the process of refinancing with Quicken Loans.
They told me that my loan is in outstanding wonderful standing I could refinance with zero down.
So I started the application process, but decided to do some checking around on the web regarding consumer reports.
Glad I did!!!
They have SO many complaints, 10000's and 1000's of them!!!
Scared me to stop the process right there on the spot.
But now I get phone calls, emails non-stop.
They are relentless.
I don't know much about re-finance but when ALL of the complaints are EXACTLY the same, then there is something very fishy going on!!
Do your due diligence and look around online before you possibly get hurt by this company.

This place is completely worthless if you don't have substantial equity in your property.
I called yesterday for a quote but realized this was a waste of time and hung up after 10minutes.
QL will not do a jumbo loan ($625k) of more than 75% LTV.
They also ask for a lot of personal info including a credit check up front in order to quote you a rate, which is ridiculous (everybody else will provide rates based upon the info you provide).
It does not appear that this company has any relation to Intuit (the software company behind Quicken) but rather simply just purchased naming rights.
I am not sure how JD Power does its survey but it really calls into question the methodology.

My credit score is from 655-708 and quicken couldn't get me a loan.
They also said good luck getting any lender to do a FHA 203k home improvement loan.
So I contacted cobalt mortgage and after reviewing my situation I'm approved within 2 days and house hunting with confidence..
They also said I have one of the lowest debt to income ratios they've seen.
Do yourself a favor and stay away from the mountain of misinformation at quicken and find yourself a local mortgage broker.
Night and day difference from call center attitude to true professionalism.

Save yourself some time and frustration.
The left hand has no idea what the right hand is doing.
Horrible experience.
Use a local Mortgage Company.
I will never apply with this company again.

Well I have read the other reviews about this Quicken Loan location but will need to disagree based on my personal experience with this office.
I first contacted the main QL website and placed an inquiry as we were 'looking' for a home at that time.
I was contacted by a team member from the corporate office (Detroit), Ray Y.
We started with a pre-approval on 8/22/13, went looking for property, signed contract on 9/1/13 and started the real application on 9/3/13.
We were prepared with all of our documents, responded to their email and 'myql.com' requests within 24 hours by uploading the requested items.
The loan request was passed from Ray Y. our original Purchase Banker to Gloria R. who was assigned to us as our Client Care Specialist as we had an actual property at that point.
She has been responsive, open and followed up on any inquiries we made in a very professional manner.
As of today we have been cleared for documents/funding and have been passed to Seth S. who will be our Purchase Closing Specialist.
We are scheduled for documents and funding next week.
Of course we are not finished yet but i am confident we will end strong and on time.
I will jump back in and provide a final update when that happens.
QL - accomplished the task.
It was easy and convenient to provide the documents through their website and both the website email updates and the regular personal calls we received from Gloria R. gave us the confidence and faith needed in the scary world of home buying.
Thank you Quicken Loans, Ray Y., Gloria R. and Seth S.

They were good before several years ago!
But had a really bad experience with quicken loans this year while I tried to purchase house this year.
I ended up spent $1000+ for  nothing.
It's unfair and they had no consideration for others.
Please stay away from this loan company !

Should refinancing take many months, a 500.00 good faith payment, constant emails and calls and just plain hounding us ???
I have never had this experience before with my first mortgage.
I am very disappointed with quicken loans and the way they conduct business.

Quicken Loans somehow got ahold of my work number and is inundating me with mortgage refinance offer calls and voicemails.
They are jeopardizing my ability to make an income to pay my existing mortgage.
Good rates or not, their hounding tactics may me want to stay far away from them.
They treat sales like hard core collections.
TERRIBLE

Loan is funded - keys are ours and they came through with all that was promised!
Very Very Happy Customer who would not hesitate to recommend them.
Note that these results only work if you are prepared to provide documents when requested at the terms/conditions you as the consumer said they would be...  We were and we are very happy we used Quicken Loans!

Two words to describe this company - HIGH PRESSURE.
I found them to be very hostile to deal with, and their rates were NOT competative in comparison to other loan agencies.
Beware!
