The Fiesta Bowl in Tempe got sooo popular that they sponsored another one in Glendale AZ this year.
It got my creative juices flowing and now I'm trial ballooning an idea to you Yelpers  ****  Football needs an Asian themed bowl!!
**** If it were Vietnamese, it'd be a Pho-Nam-Enal Bowl If it were Japanese (or Hawaiian), it'd be a Pearl Harbor / Snack Attack Bowl.
if it were Cantonese, it'd be an Endless Rice bowl If it were Korean, it'd be a Spicy Christian Bowl  OR I'd have it right here in Palo Alto (the Stanford Stadium-Go Jim Harbaugh!
) and invite the two highest academic all-American teams.
I'd use a complicated formula that's similar to the BCS poll and input characteristics like avg time to graduate, pctng of self financed tuition, weighted difficulty of courses, avg salary offerings upon graduation, and standardized testings.
This Oriental Bowl would be sponsored by Princeton Review, McGraw Hill, Miller Lite and Apple Computer.
Chino Bandito and Beard Papas could cater it.
We'd fly in 1,500 mainlander students and have the first marching Orchestra half-time show.
Maybe when the Oriental Bowl gets popular enough, we can host the a sister bowl at Cal Berkeley OR SJ State.
Any ideas on the name of this Bowl?

OU LOST!
OU LOST!
OU LOST!
This makes me very giddy!
Just for the Sooners losing, I give the Fiesta Bowl 5 stars.
Ok, so maybe Glendale and the actual bowl had nothing to do with West Virginia's victory.
I understand that.
It's logical to point that out.
I get it.
I just don't care.
OU LOST!
OU LOST!
OU LOST!
I enjoy the fact that so many Sooners turned up at the Insight Bowl to prance their team colors around.
I love it that they wore those same colors to the Fiesta Bowl only to lose!
Yes, it fills me with glee.
Pure, unadulterated happiness, I tell ya!
For both the Insight Bowl and the Fiesta Bowl, I give Arizona props.
It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience - to go watch my alum win their bowl and soon watch the annoying crimson-and-cream snobs lose theirs!
In case you hadn't heard yet... OU LOST!
OU LOST!
OU LOST!

The Fiesta Bowl ticket office staff is truly outstanding!
They have always worked very with season ticket holders on accounts and season ticket upgrades.
I have had calls with several staff members and all of them are have provided great customers service.
I have been a season ticket holder for the Cardinals, Dbacks, and Suns, and the Fiesta Bowl staff is by far the best to work with in the past.
Keep up the great work!

The Fiesta Bowl is one of the greatest college football events I've ever been to.
Everything from the organization of the pre-game tailgate parties, to the execution of the parking before/after the game is well done.
Not to mention that the football is great too.
There are 2 large tailgate party areas that are part of the event.
The "College Football's Largest Tailgate" is the area most people go to and costs $30 to get in.
Food and Beverage is not included with the ticket price.
You have to purchase that with cash at bars and food stations once you get in.
It's on a concrete lot and there's plenty of tables and seating areas.
There are several areas where corporate sponsors host games and interactive booths.
There's also a band the plays on a small stage.

Tickets are $100 to get in to this party.
With your ticket, you get up to 7 alcoholic beverages and a meal.
It's on a grass area and there are also plenty of seats and tables.
There's a band here as well and a few games.

The game speaks for itself.
Over the past 2 years I've seen 2 great games with Oklahoma State beating Stanford in OT in 2012 and Kansas State getting embarrassed by Oregon in 2013.
Both were awesome to watch.
We watched both from a suite on the 200 level, which were perfect for viewing.
In this year's Fiesta Bowl, there were plenty of empty suites, so I suggest inquiring about getting one if you ever plan to come out and watch your favorite team.
It's a very comfortable way to watch the game.
