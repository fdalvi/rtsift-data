I come here unfortunately about 2 times a week.
My son has autism and has to have McDonald fries and apple juice.
The staff is usually over the top nice or the complete opposite, I prefer the staff that have all their teeth .. really gotta wean my child off fries haha because I seriously hate Mcdonalds

Everybody knows whats what when it comes to McDonalds, i would've thought it worthless to write a review for a fast food chain but i particularly had to do this one for a reason.
This McDonalds in particular had a customer appreciation thing going on that was great, i can positively say that i hadn't seen it in any other McDonalds.
They had daily specials and some of them were pretty good, like 2 Big Macs for five dollars.
Unfortunately they aren't having these anymore but i thought it was ver worthy of mentioning.
Also, the drive thru for this location is kinda wierd.

Bad attitudes and rude behavior from both employees, one was the manager.
I'll be avoiding this McD's from here on out.

The managers and cashiers at this mcdonalds have really bad attitudes and the service here is usually unorganized especially the line but other then that each time I come here the food is always fresh so that's a plus but other then that nothing really to write home about.

Always messing something up!
No cheese..comes with cheese!
Order fries..get no fries!
Sugar cookies?
Don't even ask after 8pm!
Get it together!
