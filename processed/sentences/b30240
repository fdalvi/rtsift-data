Oh no....I have a new addiction in Downtown Chandler.
This store is absolutely beautiful.
It is Christian themed, but it will appeal to anyone.
I bought an amazing bracelet and some great gifts.
The prices are very fair.
They have jewelry, clothing for all ages, home decor and so much more.
I spent an hour looking at everything.
They just opened on 12/3/10.
Check it out!

My husband and I were out on a date the other night and we decided to walk around the little square in downtown Chandler because it was all lit up for Christmas.
That's when I discovered this new shop, it was love at first site for me.
The clothes, the hats the jewelry..
I wish I could have bought the whole store.
I told my husband "if you shop here for my Christmas present you can't go wrong".
Beautiful shop, it will be my new addiction too.

Pretty much in agreement with other comments - you can find some pretty unique garments, jewelry and home decor in this gem of a boutique in downtown Chandler.
DEFINITELY worth the wait [on your dinner tables] to check it out.

Another great little shop that has cool jewelery and accessories that are cheap but not too cheap (if you know what I mean).
