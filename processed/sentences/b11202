This dump recently closed.... hooray!
What a stinkhole!
Dirty, yucky kind of customers, and crappy food.
Illlkkk!!!
My boyfriend liked it because it was cheap.... well, you get what you pay for!
Bleeech!!!
I'd rather die than be caught in this joint - of course, I don't have to worry about that now because.... they closed down!....
HA-HA-HA!!

Oh Klondike how I miss you.
In an era of glitz and glamor the Klondike stood alone on the outskirts of Vegas Proper.
To put it mildly the Klondike was a complete shit hole.
It attracted the "regulars", and when I say regulars, I mean the $5 crack whores, pimps, addicts, drunks and misfits.
10 cent roulette?
$1 Blackjack?
I saw Stevie Wonder here once, he obviously didn't see me.
He was there with a lady friend and a big ass bodyguard.
He wouldn't admit to being Stevie Wonder though which is cool, but I know it was.
At the roulette table the dealer got pissed at my wife when she won big.
She won like $14.70 or something and he was pissed he had to cash out all of her 10 cent chips.
At the dollar table I did well sitting next to a dude that was so wasted he would pass out between hands.
We didn't get comped anything at all because we just weren't high roller enough like the one legged prostitute at the Black Jack table.
We did grab a late night "everything omelet" though at 4 in the morning to cap off the night.
It quite possibly was the most disgusting thing I ever ate in my life.
I honestly had fun here because it was like gambling in a David Lynch film.
Was it a dump?
Was it full of trashy people?
Was it down right filthy and disgusting?
Hell yeah it was, but sometimes you need that.
