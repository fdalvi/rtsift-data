This place is great!
The prices are really reasonable and the quality is fantastic.
It costs a little extra to sit in, but I am generally on the go when I go there and get it to take away any how.
There is always a good special on, the last time I went there the special was a spicy chicken wrap with salsa and cheese and it was delicious and only cost £2.80!
They also have a good range of fillings on other baguettes and sandwiches and all the ingredients that they use are fresh.
Furthermore they have a good range of coffees including lattes, espressos and cappuccinos as well as tea and cold drinks.
There are also salad boxes on sale which cost around £3.50 and there are a variety of home-made soupls on sale here as well.
Will definitely be coming back soon!

Yes, totally agree with Terry W.'s review.
In addition they also have a great selection of Cobb loaves, rolls, breads etc that although not baked on the premises, are brought in fresh daily.
A really convenient thing given Roseburn doesn't have a specialist bakery.

This small deli with a few seats to sit in with your coffee & salad roll is always clean and well presented.
The fillings for your choice of roll etc are extensive and nothing is too much bother for the friendly staff.
The quality of the coffee is high and many local business people call in for their takeaway breakfast or lunch.
