This is a pretty typical CVS location.
Conveniently located for me to pick up the random prescription or health & beauty item.
Those are typically the only things I come here for.
The staff is usually pretty friendly and their pharmacy is efficient.
They have a drive thru drop off and pick up for prescriptions, but I have never utilized that service.
I've never had to wait long for help and the lines at the register are never too long.
It's a nice place to shop for after holiday discounted candy and treats as well.
Overall, a good CVS location.
