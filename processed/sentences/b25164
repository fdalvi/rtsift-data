Great prices on items.
Great place to add some decor to your home.
Its the little nick nacks that help... We got a great deal on 3 large mirrors here, large almost 6 ft tall and 3 ft wide with nice wood frames.
They are elegant pieces that cost half the price of some furniture stores I shopped at.
If you need some decor for your house or apartment/condo try Kirklands.....

I was shopping at Kirklands today, and the cashier made my day!
He was funny, witty, and very personable.
Not only that, but he saw the coupon I had and knew that the store was offering a better one, and let me use it!
He made it a great experience and I got some cute things to decorate for fall!
I can't wait!
I love the unique things you can buy, and how cheap they are compared to other home good stores!

Great place for decorative stuff for your home, but I had to review this place because I found the CHEAPEST huge sofa picture that will cover a huge wall that I have been pushing off since the least expensive large pic was going to run me $300-$400 but I found one here for $130 (yeah, I know...so cheap but it was on sale).
The frame was plastic but it looks just as good as a $800 wood frame that would have made the pic over $1000.
So if you are looking for cool stuff to decorate your home with but do not want to spend fort knox to do so...come here.

I really enjoy shopping for unique items for the home here.
It is also a great place to shop for gifts!
