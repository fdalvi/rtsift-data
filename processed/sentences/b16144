Fine I'll claim the FTR, even after waiting for someone else to claim it.
I've been to Dula Gym about 10 times.
It's right there in Downtown Las Vegas.
Honestly, they aren't that bad of a place to go to it's not upscale and is small but has the amenities that really matter.
Its a 3.5 star rating.
They have smaller fitness room with a few heavy duty weight and cardio machines, and free weights.
They have showers and lockers and is air conditioned.
If you're looking to just play hoops or volleyball they have special hours for that.
Last I heard it's only $2 to use the basketball courts during open gym for a year.
You can also request the courts if you need them for a team practice, example for Corporate Challenge.
I'm sure there's more amenities as it a senior/community center.
The staff here are nice, friendly, and very helpful.
The facilities are well maintained.

Great small gym located Downtown.
Weightroom is small but has a combination of Free Weights and Machines as well as cardio machines.
$7.00 a month with no contract is hard to beat.
The facility is well maintained and the staff is helpfull, If your looking for a low cost alternative to the big gyms this is it.
Basketball and Volleyball leagues as well, at reasonable prices.
Glad I found this place.

I like going to Dula for pickleball, which is offered on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
They have some mighty fine players there too!
One of the staff members, Norm, is especially nice.
He is always helping people with the game and is just an all-around nice kind of guy.
Norm is one of my favorite people!
Dula is right next door to the Las Vegas Senior Center - near the freeway on-ramp and near Downtown.
It may not be in the best of neighborhoods, but it's all okay inside.
