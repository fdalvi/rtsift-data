I absolutely love this Armani Exchange!
The location is great also.
I am a regular at this store - where I usually purchase my clothes because Armani has clothes that fit me perfect where I do not have to get them tailored.
The store usually changes what they have in stock frequently, to keep a variety of clothing for both men and women.
The guys that work there are just wonderful - they are very polite and friendly.
They always grab my clothes and take them to the dressing room, because they already know that I will be purchasing some stuff!
I recommended this Armani Exchange to my friends who love fashion and trendy clothing.

LOVE this store!
I shop there for myself, my husband, for gifts - everything.
The staff is always friendly and helpful, whether I'm there with my kids in tow/flip flops/t-shirt or whether I am a bit more dressed up.
It's nice to be treated well as a customer regardless of what you're wearing and the same can't be said about most shops in Scottsdale.
On my last visit, Everett helped me find a work wardrobe for my husband.
He was so patient, knowledgeable, and friendly.
Every single item I purchased fit my husband perfectly and looked amazing.
I don't visit the Quarter without stopping in, especially when they have a sale ;)

I am so sad they closed this store.
This was so much better than the one in Fashion Square mall.
Please, bring it back.
I'll buy more dresses!
