TRUST, KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE.
Eric and his staff at APR are the perfect blend of knowledge, honesty and experience.
I always try to do business with local, family run shops.
APR fits the bill.
Eric is a business owner you can trust and will always look out for your best interest.
My wifes car was looked at and fixed promptly and honsetly.
The problem was explained in plain english so I could understand.
Eric and the Mechanic took time to help me understand and educated me on the issue.
Support small local business and one of the Good guys.
Go see Eric at APR.
Thanks Eric and APR.

These guys were fast, very reasonably priced, and did excellent work.
I will recommend them to everyone I know.

1st visit and they did a great...
The guy who serviced my car did an extra service at no charge.
Will return, especially because my barber is up the street.
