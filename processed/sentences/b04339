Place is pretty good its a gas station... 4 pumps next to a busy intersection... and also it has a small parking lot... other then that its a circle k

Stupidest layout of 4 measly broken down pumps.

I like the fancy walking beer cooler.

This circle k sucks.
They always have some bullshit reason to be closed late night posted on the locked front door.
And it so conveniently happens to be when I get off work at 2am.
Clerks are slow and will chat with the person in front of you when there's a huge line behind them.
Avoid circle k and go to QT
