Usually one of the cheapest priced gas stations in the Vegas area south of the strip.
The cash price is even a few cents less!
=)  Excellent value for a 76 gas station.

store is always in some sort of disarray but I overlook since it has the cheapest gas besides Circle K down the street.

Usually my last stop going home if I drive to Vegas.
Cheapest gas in the area

I guess since they have the cheapest cash price for gas here in Las Vegas, you don't need to have a nice personality.
The guys here are just plain dicks, one of them smelled of alcohol too.

Best gas station on the strip.
With burger brothers in the location and plenty of options to choose from at the store.
It's a must stop for coming or going from Las Vegas.
Friendly staff and very clean.

This place sucks there's 3 different prices?
Car wash 10 cents cheaper cat wash with a bag of ice 20 cents cheaper.
So tiny of a car wash in the back.
