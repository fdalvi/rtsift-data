Nice atmosphere, many nice stores.

Ok they have the normal stores, Nike, Coach, Reebox, U.A., Levis, they have very few out of the norm stores.
They have a Rawlings store but it's not open yet.
That seemed to be a sad theme here, half the stores weren't open yet.
Guess those companies don't need a Grand Opening?
It's a little of a drive for me so I don't see myself going back soon, or not until the whole place is open.
The food court was dismal, don't go hungry or thirsty cause there were three places open, Subway, a Deli out of boxes, and I believe a Asian food place.
They have these really cool looking torches burning in the 90 degree weather, & the misters seem to be keep them cool, not me.
It is nice that there are misting fans throughout the main walkways, there seemed to be the complete Chandler & Gila River police force there in case you had an emergency?
I think if you have nothing to do you can have fun there & spend some money.

The Phoenix Premium Outlets are nice, big and brand new, but not anything that the valley desperately needed.
There are already two big outlet malls in the area, and it feels like they are all filled with the same exact shops.
The only thing this one really offers is a shorter drive for east valley residents.
The mall looks huge from the outside, but it only takes a few minutes to walk from one end to the other.
There are also still quite a few stores that have not moved into their spaces, yet.
You'll find plenty of deals, but it t feels like it's more because of a 30% to 60% sale at the stores, not because you're getting something from an "outlet" or "factory" store.
I'm also not a fan of the layout of the exit.
In order to get back to Wild Horse Pass, you either to go around the Casino, or make a u-turn.
Why couldn't it be built as a straight shot?

I love the lounging options scattered throughout the mall, the live music was a nice touch, and the mister fans are dreamy, but the store selections were less than impressive.
I enjoyed my time there, but I think it had more to do with the fact that it was opening weekend and I had gift cards and other goodies handed to me more than anything else.
That said, I'm not a big time brand junkie and upscale shops don't tend to wow me.
I'm sure there are many who will really appreciate this place.
Like the countless people who waited in a humongous line for who knows how long just to get into the Coach store.
I bet they loved it.
Me?
I might go back for Wetzels Pretzels and a nice misty outdoor stroll, but that's about it.

Parking is horrendous.
Here they are sitting on countless acres of empty desert scrub land and some genius has devised a parking lot so needlessly complex it is a maze of one-way streets.
Ridiculous considering there is nothing but the casino for miles in any direction.
WTF?

This isn't really far from where I frequent so I guess for all the other reviewers who say "it's not really worth the drive", I'd say for me it kinda was.
Yes, a lot of stores not yet open, but when I did go to find things I was looking for a deal on (baby clothes and a new watch), I found them - so I can't say I didn't see any 'deals'.
Didn't make it to all the stores, but I really enjoyed my Fossil shopping experience (good prices and lots of BOGO offers and 20 and 25% off deals on beautiful leather goods that were in my price range)... also walked in to Heartstrings and found adorable sports wear for newborns for Ross prices but a way better selection and very friendly owner and staff.
Like I said, I found deals for what I was looking for so I was happy.
Since this is close to me, I'd come again...
I enjoyed the outdoor walk, liked the store options, and feel like I would be able to find deals here again in the future.
Note that their food-court area is very minimally set up so far...

There is no "Premium" in the Phoenix Premium Outlets.
Those of you expecting to find the same premium outlets that you find in Palm Springs, Orlando and Las Vegas are in a for a rude awakening.
Unless you consider Banana Republic high end, you can forget it.
There are no Gucci, Prada, Diesel, Burberry and the likes.
In fact, there is really no reason to come here at all.
You can go to any other mall or shopping area in the Valley and get better selection and service.
In fact, just go to Casa Paloma down the street on Ray and I-10 and there Banana Republic over there is much nicer.
I don't really know who they are catering to with this mall but don't be surprised to see this mall die in 5-10 years much like the Casa Grande outlets.
After all, why go here when you can shop at the same stores in the Chandler Mall which is indoor and offers a better selection and isn't much more expensive.
The parking is limited.
The design to enter and exit is cumbersome at best.
There is no appeal to coming here.
The owners of this mall better find some quality stores in a hurry or this thing is toast.

Can't really say there was anything special about this place.
Just another outlet mall.
I like the open-air motif.
Feels sort of European (most shops there are on the street, not in a large mall).
It would be hellish in August, but the past weekend it was very pleasant.
The stores I went into seemed to have a mix of "new" (i.e.
full-price) stuff and "outlet" (i.e.
discontinued and/or "less than perfect") merchandise.
I wouldn't make a point of coming here, but if I'm in the area it is fine.
It would be better if they had a few nice restaurants around.
The food court seemed to be just ordinary food court eateries (though I didn't spend a lot of time looking).

I like that this outlet mall had a live band- even though they were playing Country!
Haha.
Fascinating that they had Nike, Puma, Adidas, and many other shoe stores!
More than one selection was fun!
Don't forget to bring your fitbit because you will be walking...
Nothing major different from other so called premium outlets, but I definitely will visit again soon!
Happy Shopping

The Phoenix Premium Outlets are new and have much improving to do.
The store selection is still quite limited with many shoe stores but not much else.
The food court is extremely sad with only one Chinese place, a Subway and recently a Greenworks salad shop and also a Villa pizza.
The parking as others have stated is horrible, not many places to park and the entrance to the outlets is confusing.
There are many shops that have yet to open and hopefully they will continue to expand.
I think that the deals at some of the outlets are pretty good in comparison to Chandler Fashion Center and I would give Phoenix Premium a shot especially if you are looking for sports apparel or athletic shoes.
Overall it's still new and could stand to make a few improvements but it is a nice new place to shop in Chandler.

Really impressed with this place, lots of food stores, good prices and the people who are shopping here keep it calm and relaxed!
They are still working on a few stores and amenities but its still great!

It's exactly what you would expect from an outdoor outlet mall.
We arrived right at opening around 10am on a Saturday and it was already getting crowded...the Coach store had a queue and the line wrapped around the side of the building.
The road to access the actual outlets did indeed wrap around the casino and seemed very out of the way, but any moron could figure it out.
Clearly they are saving room for expansion or other retail space in the future.
Better than dealing with AZ Mills or driving to Anthem for those who live in the East Valley.

I am huge fan of this outlet mall.
This is the best mall to hit the East side since Chandler Mall.
Man, this is jumping and full of great stores.
However, if you are wanting to go to Coach be prepared for a LONG line.
The worst about this mall is it is OUTSIDE.
I am not sure how much I will be going as the temperatures rise.

beautiful new premium outlets located near wild horse pass.
the outlets just opened and boasts 90 stores.
not all of the shops are open just yet, but many of them are open for business and have great deals on name brand merchandise.
this outlet mall is conveniently located right off of the i-10 on the outskirts of chandler.
can't wait to visit again while in the area!

Best Outlet Mall in Phoenix  Stopped by for some shopping festivities with my wife and daughters.
A little odd in terms of traffic engineering for an entrance, but it's not bad.
And when you're in, it's full of nice stores with good deals and product.
I'm generally not a fan of outlet malls-- few have anything I really would want to buy, some stores have a cheap line they only sell at outlets, and the mall designs are meh.
However, this place is fun to hang out at and show your consumerism side.
Only real knock is the food court only has four restaraunts with one more on the way.
Clean and the options are good, though.

We drove all the way southeast to get here from the west side.
And it is ok.
It took forever to get to the park lot to the outlet.
You drove around in almost a circle to get there.
I think it is make you drive around the casino so you have to think about hum?
So I try to double my money?
Many store were still under construction and have not opened yet.
The stores that were open, the sales were not that great.
Not sure why we have so many outside malls in AZ.
It is FREAKing HOT here 6 months out of the year.

This Outlet is very similar to Tangers located near Arrowhead.
For the most part, they have all the same stores with a few exceptions.
Two that come to mind is Ralph Lauren Polo and Tommy Bahamas.
RLP is massive in size and at least two to three times larger than any other of their outlets.
The selection is outstanding.
From what I can deduce, they are taking their department store inventory and just cutting them out entirely.
The merchandise is marked down across the board by 30%, see photos.
Tommy Bahamas Outelt is new to me, though I have shopped at their stores in Kierland and Scottsdale Fashion.
The quality of their merchandise is outstanding.
Another plus to this location is the Saks Fifth Avenue, Off 5th outlet store.

This outlet mall has a good selection of stores ranging from the high-end Armani to basic inexpensive wares from Old Navy.
They also have children's clothing, toys and games, and a book store.
We went over the 4th of July weekend and most stores were having massive sales, with some exceptional sales such as Banana Republic with their 50% off the entire store sale.
The way to get here is a bit roundabout, as you will have to drive away from the mall before you start to head towards it again.
Although there seems to be a lot of parking spaces, there's just one small section that has covered canopy parking.
Options for food are a bit limited.
So far, there's Chinese, Italian, salads/sandwiches, and Subway.
Across from the food court there's also a pretzel shop.
There will be a Charley's grilled cheesesteaks/subs that will open up soon, as well as a Dairy Queen (The DQ will be outside of the food court though).
We browsed through a few of the stores, and found a good selection of items for a great deal since there were so many sales going on.
Our arms were full with bags after a few hours of shopping!

Gotta say this is a really nice place.
A little difficult to get to but the stores are new and clean and a very beautiful.
Once the weather is nice it wil be a lovely spot to hang.
It has little living room type areas to sit and relax and wait for your peeps to finish in their stores.
Love that there is a Perry Ellis there and no other place has it except Arizona Mills.
Also has a nice food court with a variety of places to munch for lunch, dinner or snack.

I wasn't very impressed.
I don't think Phoenix has a lot to choose from when it comes to malls and outlet deals.
So if you're on vacation or visiting from out of state, do your shopping at home.
I spent way more than I intended which means I did find some things to buy but they were all more than I expected from an outlet.

This mall has a nice selection of stores.
With that being said I didn't think that the prices were killer.
It seemed to me that I can find similar deals online.
(I'm a great gonga finder on the web) I went to buy a purse.
I tried the Michael Kors, Coach, Kate Spade, and even Saks 5th Ave. the styles that I did like were in odd colors or they had a large quantity of purses that I was not interested in.
Kinda frustrating cuz I drovr all the way from Tucson.
I did pick up some clothes that I was buying as a gift and they were decently priced but far from a steal.
I would shop here again if I'm in the area but will never go out of my way to come here again.

This place needs more stores in it.
From what I've read it's pretty new so perhaps when I return to visit AZ, they will have better and more stores.
I picked up a few items at an ok price but for being an outlet their prices weren't impressive.
The food court also really needs some massive help.
I wouldn't eat at any of the places here.
It wasn't crowded and parking wasn't horrible but I'm from overpopulated, crowded California so anything beats that.
Not a bad place but I've been to better outlets with much better prices.

I really like this outlet mall, nice to get away from the Ray Rd fiasco.
The only downer is this mall is only open until 9pm.. on a Friday and Saturday they should stay open until 10 and have the food (or a coffee/snack cart) open until 11.
A splash pad like the one at Tempe Marketplace  would be great too.
Also, I only noticed one play area for kids ages 5-12, where's the toddler area?
It would be great if they added the play area on the maps.
They have seating areas and water features, very relaxing.

I got lucky because Mr. M had a weekday off so we decided to check this place out, and I needed to do a return or exchange at the Under Armour store as well.
The reason I say I got lucky is I have a thing about shopping on the weekends.
Particularly Saturdays.
I don't do it.
I don't need or want that stress in my life.
To visit the outlets on a Friday morning was heavenly.
Almost no people around to annoy me, although we narrowly avoided some crazy broad in a hurry using her double stroller to carve her route.
They need driving tests for those things.
Anyway, we visited the UA store and took care of business.
The young man working there was all over it and had our exchange started for us so that when we got to the register after doing a little browsing, he only had to add one more item I grabbed, swipe my card and we were outta there.
We decided to wander around and noticed a good assortment of stores.
I look forward to going back to check out Columbia, Merrill, Kitchen Connection, Book Warehouse, etc, but we didn't feel like doing much more shopping.
Just strolling.
I did make one more stop.
If you've read some of my reviews you may know I'm also a road warrior and am in many different hotels.
Embassy Suites tend to use bath products from Crabtree & Evelyn with the Citron scent.
I like it, but whenever I've gone into a regular C & E store, the prices make me sound like Ryan Reynolds' character from Waiting, "WHAT THE F**K EVER!!
"  I'm not paying that for soap.
However, the C & E outlet has most of these products for half off, so I was able to get a gift basket with 3 Citron full-sized products: lotion, hand treatment, and shower gel for $25 instead of $50.
Now I can treat myself and smell real pretty too, without breaking the bank.
I look forward to a return visit to this outlet mall.
On a weekday.

This mall was recently constructed so it is still pretty clean.
It seemed that only 1 out of every 10 stores were actually outlet stores, so not a lot of good deals here.
There is no signage directing you to the outlet, just the main sign you see from the highway.
Once I got off the highway, it was a little confusing getting there.

Great place to shop and a lot of variety.
I prefer this outlet over the newer Glendale one because it actually has some shade and better stores.
Something the developers should have been more mindful of considering we are in Arizona.

Great sales at Calvin Klein and Perry Ellis this week!
And I'm surprised to find more of my sizes.
All the employees I met at every store were friendly and helpful.
Shoutout to perfumania, gap and banana republic who also showed really great customer service.

Large range of stores from the higher end of the spectrum to the less expensive.
We headed here for shoes and they did not disappoint in the selection of shoe stores.
Everything is obviously outdoors like Tempe Marketplace which I don't really understand, we live in the desert!
It's hot outside, I don't want to be walking in the sweltering heat or the cold in the winter.
Overall, I would not return again.

Merry Christmas to me at the Calphalon store!
Buy two get two free offers on utensils, baking pans, and knives.
I only went in there for a steamer/pasta pot and came out with all kinds of goodies for a great price!
Mr. M left me unattended while he went in the Under Armour store.
I started to feel guilty about the pile I was accumulating, so when he found me, I gave him my best, "Honey, you're the knife expert....what do you think?
"  Big wink here.
Then some of the $$$ spent was all him!
Yeah.
I'm wily like that.
Next, he'll be a Dutch oven expert.
;-)    The two ladies that helped us were THE BEST!
One gal is truly a knife expert and answered all my questions.
We cruised through the Nike store because Mr. M likes the Nike free running shoes, but the colors are just God awful anymore.
Are you telling me dudes wear neon pink and blue shoes?
Teal and gold shoes?
Wtf ever!!
Their shoes look so cheaply made anymore.
We'll wait on that one and go to a real running store.
Overall, I love this outlet mall, but you'll never catch me here on a weekend.

I love nike items.
I bought bball tank top.
Love it and hella cheap!
I got it for $7 and tax.
Not bad for a sale item.
Def goin back again next time.
Customer service was good also.
Cashier was helpful and asked if everything is ok.
Happy man righhh here lol

We went, we shopped, we eat, we left.
I will be back soon...I have that suspect feeling.
moreover, there was all that I was looking for.
I like this place, however, am going to need to compare this place with other outlets.
I'll update my review when I visit next.

My roommate and I decided to drive down to the outlets to see if we could get any shopping done.
The first result on Yelp gave me wrong directions, but luckily we saw the outlets and figured out how to get there.
Apparently you have to go through the wild horse pass entrance.
We quickly found parking and then browsed.
I am not a fan of this layout of outlets (no directory, two main corridors, similar to the Glendale outlets).
There was one store in particular I wanted to visit but we hadn't passed it and I wasn't interested in walking around until we found it so oh well.
The few stores we did stop in had good deals and we ended up grabbing a couple of things.
If there is a store you want to check out here, I would recommend it, but I wouldn't race back.

Came here after a thrilling visit to The Rawhide and was sad to find out they don't have a coffee shop.
I think you can get some coffee at the Wetzle Pretzle and Starbucks is scheduled to open in 2014, but currently it is lacking.
The bf and I made a round here and ended up with no purchases (that's unheard of from us!

I like this place - nice assortment of stores/brands that will satisfy everyone on your shopping list.

Best shopping ever!!!
Great sales this weekend.
Polo and Michael Kors did it's thing.

Tons of selections and clean.
Great prices too!
Got a cardigan from J.Crew for dirt cheap.
Definitely would come back when I'm in the area again.

First off I'm not a fan of outlet shopping centers and have grown tired of the over satiated marked here in Phoenix.
But I was talked to go to this location to take family that was visiting from out of town.
When I got here and started to walk around I actually started to like it.
Clean and spacious and good stores.
A little weak on food choices if you are hungry, and no Starbucks as of yet (they are building one) but besides that good choices of stores.
I like it way better than the Tanger outlets in Glendale, or the Anthem ones.
I'll probably stop here on my way to or from Tucson next time.

This place is fantastic!!
I love the selection of stores they have here.
Old Navy has great deals on clothing, as does Guess.
As for designer bags, go to the Coach store!
I loveeee Michael Kors, and they do have great deals at the outlet store, but nothing tops the Coach store.
Every time I have been there they are having a huge sale AND handing out 50-70% off coupons at the door.
I always walk out with a huge bag and spend less than $100!

This place is awesome!
So many good stores that I'd actually go into!
Great deals and sales too!!!!
Going in a holiday (like Presidents' Day) is great too bc you get even BETTER DEALS!
I can tell you I will so be back!
Live the NIKE outlet!

By far the best outlet Ive been too.
Aldo, Nine West, Saks, Banana, Polo, Michael Kors, Tommy Bahama, Armani, and much much more.
Its all outdoors shopping, so the best time to go is in the Winter or Spring.
Easily spent 4 hours here today.
LOTS of parking, so that is a plus.
The location is kind of far from me, but I am certainly going to be a return customer.
Love this place for sure.

My husband and I had a blast shopping through the great deals at this newish premium outlet...not too crowded...up to par with some of the best (could give Palm Springs a run for their money).
Found great deals in Banana, Jones NY, Coach, Mikey K's, Sacks....all of em!

Very clean and spacious, this outlet mall offers a great variety of stores.
I can't wait till the Starbucks opens!
Unfortunatly, some of the stores have obviously raised their retail prices to offset their sale prices.
Aother stores have some fantastic deals.
#Jewelery!!
Never pay retail again =)

I really enjoy the Premium Outlets.
It offers a large variety of stores, most are "premium" or a bit more upscale.
Every store I went into seemed to have a good selection of off price items, and also the regular price items.
We hit this on a great day this last visit, the weather was not too hot so we just strolled and shopped and then ate in the food court.
If you have something specific on your mind that you want to find for an occasion, you should have not trouble finding it here.

I usually come to the Phoenix area during spring training and was surprised to see these outlets when I most recently visited because they didn't exist when I was in the area the previous year.
Stopped by on a weekday evening and it wasn't very busy.
Had fun shopping and bought things from a few stores.
I liked the variety of stores as they had not just clothing stores but places that sold things like kitchenware, books, and candy.

Update:  Starbucks has opened its stand and is packed with happy customers.
Best new improvement - Mister fans!
All major walkways have fan-blown misters that cool the outdoor areas making it quite comfortable.
Its actually enjoyable to walk around outdoors and browse the shops.
Tip- Pick up the shopping guide (on stands in restroom hallways) for a free map and coupons inside!
Tip- Park in the North lot (near DressBarn, Old Navy) for shaded parking!
These guys really understand what Phoenix shoppers want =)

Ok all the bags have discount 20-30% and then + 50%!
Is that awesome?

I love the Premium Outlets!
So many awesome stores and lots of deals to be found.
Plus, it's not that far from home for me and I enjoy going to different places to shop.
My favourite store there is the Nike Factory store and I've bought 2 pairs of shoes there so far!
Every place I've been in there, the staff has been friendly and very helpful.
Not your snob store mentality at all!

The stores are nice but the people around here are stuck up.
Even the employees aren't courteous.
First and last time shopping there.

Phoenix premium outlets at wild horse pass is absolutely amazing!
So much to do for both women and men!
and everything is at an amazing discount!
Spent just about an entire day here and never once got bored.
And even though it's an outdoor mall, it's nice and cool with fans and misters everywhere.
Which is essential in this Arizona heat!
Love the diversity of stores as well.
Clothing stores for people of every size, designer clothing and accessories for half the price.
Cookware and even discount cosmetics from high end brands!
Also.
The casino next door where you can try and double your money and come back and purchase even more :)   The food court has lots of different choices as well.
Including some healthy eats.
Although I would not reccomend the "villa Italian kitchen" but that's another review.
All in all, it's a great place to spend your day with friends and family.
If you don't live close it's well worth the trip!

It's all outside in the 108 degree heat, with the only thing to refresh you are mist fans that only manage to mess up your hair and nothing else.
It's really spread out with no store that is worth going to that isn't at an other indoor outlet.
One of the main bathrooms only has one stall and one urinal with a long line out the door.
Ugh

This outlet mall is brand new so everything is clean and shiny.
The common areas are outdoors so it is not a pleasant shopping experience in the summer.
They do have an indoor food court so that is a plus.
Like other outlet malls, some stores are pretty good prices and some may not be.
It does seem like they all have a great selection and are well organized and not crowded.
I don't think a lot of people have heard of this place yet.
I'll write an update around the holidays... we'll see how good of a shopping venue they are at that time!

Customer service level is high.
There is a large selection of quality brands, and the prices are incredible.
I got average 50% everything.
Some items are in regular stores now.
This is my new favorite spot to shop!
