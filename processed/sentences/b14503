We walk our dog here pretty regularly on the weekends, the smoothies are good, the coffee is OK, and Staff is friendly.
Bu that is not why we go, it's all about about our dog!
They have homemade treats for her, muffins, yappy yogurt, and all kinds of other things.
They also have a great selection of natural and organic dog foods and supplies.
If they don't have an item they will order it for you within a week.
Their location is nice, it is at the south end of Morrison Ranch with a view of the man-made lake, we will often take our dog for walk around the lake and then stop and sit outside.
You cannot bring dogs into the store because of County health code, but there is plenty of outside patio space.
Check it out!

In the Raw is just a great place to take my Golden Retriever on a nice, sunny Sunday afternoon.
We stopped by today after a long walk around the lake across the street.
They have a nice little courtyard/patio with a fountain...it's very relaxing.
Chloe enjoyed a bowl of ice water along with some carob/peanut butter Yappy Yogurt and six Mutt Muffins :)  She was in doggie heaven!
They have a variety of beverages and smoothies, sandwiches, bagels, muffins etc.
Right next store is a Subway, so my boyfriend and I enjoyed our lunch while our dog enjoyed her treats.
Overall, it's a nice place to just hang out.

Awesome!
Awesome!
Awesome!
This place has got it going on when it comes to healthy juices and food.
We visited for the first time last Sunday and went again on Monday and brought our dog.
We got him the doggie yogurt which he loved and we had the six on the beach and raw body shake.
We took a veggie sandwich to go for lunch.
If you are RAW or into juices this is the place to go!
