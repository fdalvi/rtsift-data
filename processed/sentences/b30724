I called Stan to help me with a punch-list of items for my vacation condo.
I needed a latch put on, toilet seat installed, grout in bathroom, etc.
He called me back in a timely manner and showed up when he said he would.
Not only did he fix all the things on my list but saved me $$ by using some existing hinges that I thought wouldn't work.
The next day I called him for advice after 2 failed attempts at getting keys made (that didn't work) for the front door.
He came and worked on the keys and recomended a new lock.
He bought and installed the lock (after I left town) and mailed me my copy.
Stan is now my go-to guy for anything (large or small) in terms of home repair.
He's as honest as the day is long and I feel very fortunate that he was available to assist me with my condo fixits.
I can only offer my heartfelt recommendation and hope that he's not too busy the next time I call upon him!

My dad was in assisted living for a temporary stay and I needed a rail installed in the shower quickly.
Stan and I set the entire thing up by texting (which I loved).
He came out the next day and was puntual, professional and efficient.
He charges a reasonable rate as well... would definately call him (or text) again.

We are renting out a home in Scottsdale AZ.
I found Stan on Yelp and read all the comments on him.
Well we gave him a try.
Not only did he do the job, I had to pay him with a check while I was out of town.
He is a very trusting person as well.
So when we move into the home we are renting out, I know who I will call when I need a trustworthy man to do the job!
Stan....Stan is the man!
Thanks Stan,  Dennis and Karin Trovato

Stan is truly incredible.
Best handyman we have found in any city we have lived in.
Stan is very professional, trustworthy, and does quality work at a reasonable price.
Stan fixed our landscaping lighting when others told us we had to replace them, saving us a ton of money.
Then he stopped by the next day just to make sure they were still working.
We are lucky to have found him!
