So my mother and I went to Enterprise Rent-A-Car for our stay in Arizona for Spring Training.
I forgot about their slogan, about how they would pick you up, so we took a taxi to the Enterprise located on Country Club Road (since it was pretty close to the Cubs stadium).
Anyway, the manager who helped us out was amazing and we got an amazing deal.
My mom told them to give her a small car, however, they didn't have any small cars left so we got a Dodge Journey, the perfect little SUV for me to drive us around!
I have to say that this SUV had excellent gas mileage and ran perfectly.
We didn't even realize we were going 75 down the freeway!
The Enterprise Rent-A-Car was great and told us that we could drop it off at the airport when we left; which we did.
All in all we had a great experience and would recommend this Enterprise!

We reserved a small truck so we could go out of town, up into the mountains, but since every college student in the state of Arizona was moving home for the summer, there were none available.
They upgraded us to a SUV for the same price.
I would definitely use this location again.

There seem to be so many Enterprise rental locations near where I was staying that I got curious and decided to drive around one day when I had nothing else to do and just check them out I found that two of the four locations near me we're actually closed with empty storefronts.
This was one of them.
I went ahead and took a photo to show it is not in business.
