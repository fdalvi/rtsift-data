I absolutely adore Misty!
Only stylist I know I can trust to make decisions about how to change my hair, and simply leave it to her.
I know it will look good.

Misty is the best!
I usually just let her decide what to do with my hair, and it always looks great.
With other stylists, I always find that I need to go home and redo my hair.
But with Misty it's always soft and shiny and perfect.
She is a great conversationalist too, which is super important to me.
I don't even live in Las Vegas anymore, but when I come to town twice a year, seeing Misty for a new do is always on the top of my to/do list.

Misty is a great stylist!
She makes you feel welcome and comfortable as soon as you walk through the door of her super cute and private work area in Sola Salons.
I decided to cut off ten inches of hair to donate.
Misty new exactly what needed to be done and made the process super easy!
I am very low maintenance when it comes to my hair (wash and let air dry) but I wanted a cut that looked stylish and had some body.
Misty gave me exactly what I was looking for and I could not be happier.
I have been getting compliments left and right about the new haircut.

Misty has been my hairstylist for 2 years.
She is wonderful and very talented.
Recently I got a Enjoy Keratin smoothing treatment from her.
It ways everything my frizzy hair needed.
If you need one, I highly recommend her.
Thanks Misty!
