I have to be honest, I only came here because I was working my way through the various list of deals in my Snapfax, and this place was offering 40% off your first visit (normally they charge up to Â£34 for a cut & blow dry, which isn't too bad but every little helps!).
I thought their full price was just right - reassuringly expensive enough to know it's going to be good, but not so expensive that you feel like you're doing them a favour by being there.
I haven't been back since my first visit, although that's not necessarily a reflection on them - I now live much further away and am too lazy to trek all the way over to Tollcross.
I think if I lived closer I'd go back.
The staff were friendly enough, and the stylist genuinely listend to what I asked for (nothing annoys me more than when you ask for "just a little bit off the ends" and next thing you know half your hair's lying on the floor beside you!).
There are a ridiculous number of salons and hairdressers in this part of Edinburgh, but I'd recommend this one.
