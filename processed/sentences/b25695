Worst Pharmacy Experience in 30 years!
Paul, the pharmacist hates his job and was very unprofessional.
At one point he had a customer banging on the drive thru window because of their frustration.
I will never set foot in this Walgreens again.
Horrible experience.

great store.
always clean, so are the bathrooms.
employees can be rude but thats on a rare occasion.
always go here for little last minute errans.
close by my house so thats also awesome.

Terrible prices at this Pharmacy.
They quoted me a price 5x higher than I pay at a large, national, well-known superstore chain.
And this on a drug that is generic and old as the hills.
AWFUL!
