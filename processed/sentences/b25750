I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised by Consign 'n Design.
Tucked among a small strip mall of other consignment stores, this store was the only one that had nice looking items for purchase at reasonable prices.
The customer service was very nice.
All in all a great experience.
If you are looking for a consignment store that isn't charging insane prices, stop by Consign' N Design.

I came across this nice shop this afternoon.
Bought a table and chairs.
Great customer service!
I recommend this shop to those who are looking for that unique item at a reasonable price.
Check it out!

Ive heard this store is under new management and I've never met a more rude owner.
I brought my well behaved granddaughter in the store with me.
My granddaughter tried on a hat very carefully and looked adorable in it.
I was considering purchasing it for photos and the owner walked up to her and took the hat off of her then watched us throughout the store.
It was unbelievable.
I spoke with another person about her and they said she admits that she "hates children" and "doesn't want them in her store".
In no way was my child misbehaving.
I will never step foot into this store again!
