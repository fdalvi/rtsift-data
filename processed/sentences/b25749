Smug bozos.
Just what I'd expect from most realtors, but these guys really fit the bill.
Difficult to try and work with, irresponsible, unresponsive, and just too laid back for my taste.
It's like surf-bum laziness collided with Wall Street money-grubbing.

I moved down here from Prescott looking for a house to rent.
Found this place by word of mouth and they were great.
I was in a different city and went out of their way to help me out.
They took my deposit to the management company and when we were looking for a house they drove around all day and never complained.
I was picky and they never seemed frustrated!!
Thank you!

I have worked with this company for 5 plus years.
Mr. Love is very helpful and knows his business.
If I send him someone he will always go above and beyond ro make sure they find an apartment that fits their needs.
He is the one that I refer everyone to.
If you need an apartment they are the people to call.
