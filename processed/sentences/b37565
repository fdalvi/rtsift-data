It's lowes, the build and grows and great....

Bought a kitchen 5 days ago and now I'm back at the store returning it.
The person at plumbing said I was the first to return it, but after explaining everything and what I did and didn't do, he stated it probably was just a defect.
It still is a pain in the butt.
Since I installed and then worse had an issue uninstalling it.
I picked out another brand since I didn't want the same hassle I had when I purchased the giagni and picked up an American standard instead.
On top of it all, the standard is more expensive then the Giagni, so the plumbing guy said when I get back to customer return just tell them if u can swap it out for the same price.
This is where Asst Mgr John came into play.
He said "of course".
And this is what put the cherry on top.
No arguing with anyone, just come in pick up and go.
And without any hassles or headaches.
