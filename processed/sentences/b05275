When it comes to food, I'm easy to please.
It's almost as if a place has to go out of their way for me to be disappointed.
This particular Subway had it in for me.
I came in with one thing on my mind: Broccoli cheese soup.
They didn't have it (it's seasonal, so that's fine), but they did have Chicken Noodle.
Unfortunately, the lady helping me said her co-worker forgot to make the soup.
Queue Price is Right failure trumpet.
I ended up getting a turkey sub on wheat.
Not only were they stingy with the toppings and condiments, the meat didn't taste fresh.
However, the customer service there is great.
They were friendly and apologized sincerely for the soup ommision.
I think great customer service can cover up a plethora of mistakes.
2 stars instead of 1.

Deciding what to eat today, we came across the street from work and decided on Subway.
It's always a great choice for a healthier lunch.
No surprise to anyone, when you walk into a Subway, your nose is overwhelmed with the smell of baked breads.
It's too much sometimes.
Your clothes smells and lingers throughout the day with that bread smell!
Not a big deal but I would prefer it not smell that bad.
Every time I go there, I always get the same thing:  Turkey foot long sandwich on 9-Grain Oat wheat bread.
I add American cheese and toast the sandwich.
For toppings, I got the mayo, spinach, lettuce, onions, olives, bell peppers, cucumbers and tomatoes.
Such a great sandwich with not a lot of calories.
My food came to about $7.
No really problems with this place.
The location is clean, lots of seating.
Long lines told me it was popular.
I will for sure be back!
