We went here today looking for some authentic Scotish cuisine and I was very impressed.
The location is very good for those exploring Edinburghs old town and famous royal mile.
The decor was a bit old skool with some tacky pictures on the wall but when the food arrived you will no longer notice them because our meal was delicious.

The Wee Windaes is great if you're looking for an alternative to the uber cool food establishments in Edinburgh.
By that I don't mean that it is the dork of Edinburgh's restaurants or anything - far from it.
It's got a great, solid menu that will rival many of Edinburgh's finest dining places, and is a firm favourite with the locals.
It's got a really impressive seafood menu which includes the classic cullen skink but I am a sucker for Bangers and Mash, so I opted for that last time I was here.
It was absolutely delicious and done to perfection.
It's simple but one of their strongest and most popular options.
The decor is staid and arguably a little dated but I quite like its charm.
The way it looks reminds me of hotel dining rooms I used to visit in British seaside resorts when I was a kid.
It looks like it's not changed in years but there's something comforting about that.
My only complaint would be a small one - its opening hours.
They serve food from 6-10 but sometimes I'm really craving a bangers and mash if I'm through for a gig and have done a shift of mad dancing.
But that's a selfish demand and it's nice to pop in for a quiet, calming meal at dinnertime.
Good old fashioned grub with a couple of fancy options.
I like it.
