Love this CF gym.
The coaches are really involved and there's a big emphasis on form, mobility and avoiding injury so you can train for the long term.
The facility is very basic - but all the essentials are there.
I like it that way, the foo foo gym with the latest ellipticals etc is not my cup of tea.
There is also a good community here, that is a welcome change from other gyms.
I am pretty new to CF - so I may not be the best reviewer, but I really like the feel of Crossfit 602.
Keep up the good work 602'ers!

I have been going to 602 for about 6 months and cant say enough about this gym.
The Coaches are great, they work with you, and they help you.
They put together great classes and are always challenging us.
The members of 602 are great people.
We all check our Ego at the door and encourage each other throughout the process.
Keep up the good work 602 staff!

Walking into a CrossFit box for the first time can make a fairly-in-shape-but-not-really person feel intimidated or nervous.
Some people see the CrossFit Games on TV and gain the perception that they need to look like those ridiculously fit athletes and be able to squat 300lbs to be a CrossFitter.
Truth is, that's not really the case, and CrossFit 602 will help you realize that.
First of all, the overall atmosphere here is so ridiculously welcoming.
The first time I came here everyone working out took the time to give me a heartfelt hello and introduce themselves.
I was immediately greeted by Ken, who is one of the owners, and though he was clearly on his way out for the night he happily stuck around to give me a tour, a basic rundown of how they operate, and answer any questions I had.
The fact is, CrossFit is for everyone because the workouts are scaled to your ability, no matter what kind of shape you are in or how old you are.
And there's no better place to start getting in shape than here.
Like most CrossFit locations, this place is not decked out in the newest shiny equipment but that's because you don't need fancy ellipticals and weight machines to get a butt kicking workout.
Instead you have barbells, pull up bars, medicine balls, tractor tires, kettlebells, etc...all the basics for the no-frills approach to fitness.
You have plenty of support between the helpful and knowledgeable coaches and the encouraging people working out next to you.
Consider me the newest dedicated member of CrossFit 602.

Best CrossFit box ever!
After receiving a kidney transplant in 2010 I was looking for a way to get in shape.
I ended up at CrossFit 602 and couldn't be more happy about my choice.
In my first 3 months at 602 I lost over 30lbs.
Coaches Ken Miller, Roman and Armando Cruz are awesome!
They really care about the success of each member.
They take the time to teach proper form to help prevent injuries, at the same time they constantly push you to get better.
