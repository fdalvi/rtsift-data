this post office has been a favorite of mine for many a year.
but since they started routing my undeliverable packages to the fucking Van Buren Post Office i have been pissed off.
i do not know why i need to go so god damn far just to find out i got a new chotchkey from Camel that was too big to fit in my mail box.
waste my time.
i want a refund..maybe even a complimentary roll of stamps.
probably one of the cooler post offices to get a PO Box at..except you will have no access to your mail after 6pm.
i have to rate it 2 stars simply on the fact it USED to be better.
now it's only Meh!

I have a box here....When I have been able to catch the window open, the employees have always been friendly and helpful.
The hours here still bewilder me.
I have had a package waiting for almost 2 weeks and either I get there too early or I am late and last night I got here about 10 till 6 and the doors were locked.
The perceived convenience of this location between work and home is what will keep me renting a box here but I wish I knew the hours.
Now I will have to take some time off work just to get my mail.

I recently had a terrible experience with the USPS, so I was pleasantly surprised when the staff was polite, kind, and incredibly helpful.
I didn't feel rushed or silly asking lots of questions about all my postage options.
This post office is very conveniently located adjacent to downtown and it seems like there is always parking within a block's walk.
