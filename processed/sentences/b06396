Great Service!!

Smog Inspections in Nevada especially for those of us who have seen a Colorado inspection are laughable annoyances that you just want to get over and done with.
There's a lot of places in Vegas that can do smog checks...Jiffy Smog sent me a coupon in the mail though and that's what got me to their door.
This particular Jiffy Smog location wasn't much to look at from the outside, but the staff working here understood what Jiffy means.
I was in and out in under 10 minutes and I liked that alot.
I don't know if all of the other Jiffy Smog locations have it but this location has the option to let you pay the DMV registration on the spot for an additional fee.
This can be helpful if you're severely time challenged or you don't want to find a kiosk or endure an actual DMV office visit.
Overall...when I need a smog check this Jiffy Smog location will be on my short list of places I'll go back to.
