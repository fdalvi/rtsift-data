I was recently introduced to Alkaline water and I heard this Water & Ice has a process that is better than most, so I gave it a try.
I guess water stores are all pretty similar but what I found at this location, whereby prompting me to give it 5 stars is this: the service was awesome.
I was expecting the place to be pretty much self serve, no assistance, figure it out on my own, but I was wrong.
Thanks David (owner) for making my first experience with Alkaline water exceptional.
I will be back.

Very friendly service : customer first.
Stopped for couple bags of ice.
There wasn't even a pitch that I could call a soft sell, just really a mention of the expensive, special, magic water, then he offered a brochure and just let it be.
My bill was cheaper than I thought but I only had a debit card, no cash.
Instead of suffering the transaction charges from visa for such a small bill, he insisted I just take the ice bags and "get him back next time".
Now, your mileage may vary, so dont go in expecting the same and don't take advantage of their hospitality...like I did.
Still owe them a buck seventy five.
OOPS, I'm coming dont worry
