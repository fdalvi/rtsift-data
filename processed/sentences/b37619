Great selection of glass .
I had an issue with a piece and paul went out of his way to make the situation right .
He was very knowledgeable and helped me make a good choice .
Honest, trust worthy and great selection - lower priced items as well as higher priced items such as rehab.

Sold me a knock off name brand water pipe as the real thing.
I trusted Planet Zong due to word of mouth from friends.
Sadly, I was taken.
When I got home I realized the down stem didn't fit right so I e-mailed the company of my water pipe hoping they could tell me the right size and help guide me to purchasing one that fit right so they had me send pictures of piece.
Upon an e-mail I received back from one of the staff I was informed that the piece I had bought was a knock off and that they don't even sell their water pipes in the U.S. (Canadian Brand).
So please don't get taken like me and spend lots of your hard earned money on cheap knock off brands thinking your buying the real thing.
Had they had told me it was a knock off and then sold it to me would have been a different story.
But if your like me, you know good glass is not cheap so I when I spent my money on the real thing I expect to get the real thing.
**UPDATE** I called and talked to the store manager.
Upon explaining my story to him he told me there was nothing he could do.
He apologized and said that he remembers the piece and that he wasn't sure where they had gotten it (even though he's the manager).
He wasn't able to do a refund or exchange or at least offer a resolution to my problem.
Oh but he did mention that he can guarantee all the pieces in the shop today are genuine.
LOL!
Why bother and take the chance when the trust has already been broken.
Next time I'll take my business to Traders or Blaze.
Where I know for sure every piece in their shop is real and not a knock off.
**UPDATE** The manager of the store called me back and left a message saying that they had found my piece on a few websites and had some info and to call back.
I called back and the manager proceeded to tell me that he had went online and found my piece and that they did actually order the piece from GEAR.
I had told GEAR about the smoke shop I gotten mine from but they didn't say anything about them being a previous retailer.
I then told the manager how I also did my research and the ones I looked up look nothing compared to the ones on the internet.
I then said but if you can show me some kind of  proof that you guys purchased this piece from gear then that would be great.
He then got defensive and said hey look man I don't know what else we can do for you its just a matter of speculation at this point.
I then replied okay well I'll talk to your manager tomorrow and proceeded to swear at me and say that his manager will tell me the same sh*t. I then ended the call.
So if they really wanted to protect their name and rep they would have just made things right.
Instead they decided to be greedy and money hungry and start using profanity to me a customer who had spent over $100 in their shop.
Just take it from me GO TO TRADERS OR BLAZE OR TRAILS OR ANY REPUTABLE SMOKE SHOP BUT HERE.

This is in response to the previous review but I felt as if my last experience deserved a review of its own.
Upon my previous experience with this smoke shop I had given up hope.
As soon as I thought there was nothing left to do but accept what had happened the owner of the smoke shop contacted me.
He told me to come in and he would make things right and that's exactly what he did.
The owner was a very nice man not only did he meet me at the store in person to talk to me about what had happened and why I might have had my problem in the first place but he also exchanged the piece for a REAL AUTHENTIC HIGH QUALITY GLASS PIECE.
He did everything in his power to make sure I left happy and with a smile on my face and that's exactly what happened when I left.
I can vouch for Planet Zong and say that everything they have in the shop now is real and authentic high quality glass.
I was very upset about my previous experience but by the time I left this last time the owner made me  completely forget all about it.
I would recommend Planet Zong to anyone looking for a real and authentic glass piece whether its on the low end or the high end.
THANK YOU SO MUCH PLANET ZONG!!
I will definetly be back.

This place looks really nice when you get in, nice selection even though it's not in the best of areas.
But as the way with most head shops in Phoenix now a days, this one cares very little for it's individual customer.
In fact, if you were to take the dude that's generally behind the counter and replace him with a used car salesman I'd say it would be very hard to tell the difference.
They will rip you off, with a smile on his stupid face he will bend you over.
Now, I don't want you to think this review is based on malice, so I should inform the reader that I have been to this place multiple times, and given it multiple chances, as I was a student up the road at GCC for a bit and for the sake of convenience I bought more than a few things.
I got ripped off, every time.
Every.
Time.
Massively over-priced thin glass, pre-busted vaporizer pen with no return policy, novelty rigs with fake names on them, shirts with huge holes and multiple other cases from my friends who gave this place the same chance.
Paraphernalia boutique is real close, trust me from one head to another, skip this place, you will get ripped off.
