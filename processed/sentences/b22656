second-hand charity shop with many locations throughout the UK.
some things in here are incredible bargains, others not so.
i saw ted baker shirts that would retail new for over $100 for $10-$20.
great selection of used books (a current edition lonely planet poland guide that's $20 or more new for just $5) and bric-a-brac that obviously would vary from shop to shop but all in all this place is worth a browse-- and it's all for a good cause.

When I returned from travelling I had to attend a job interview, but the only clothes I had in Edinburgh were khaki trousers, black vests and Birkenstock sandals.
Skint and at my wits end, I decided to have a look in here.
I have to admit that I am not really the type of person who enjoys rooting through rails of musty clothing that someone may have died in, but if you ignore the handwritten price tags and mish mash of items, this could almost be a commercial shop.
After a mini-browse, I ended up finding a brilliant smart gray dress (formally of Miss Selfridge) and a silk scarf; my bounty only set me back Â£5 and I got the job, result.
Although this shop is not located in a particularly wealthy area, whoever is donating stock is very generous.
It's definitely worth having a look around.

This branch of Shelter is always well stocked when I visit.
It's small, but absolutely rammed with good quality donations.
The filtering process for what ends up on the shop floor much be good, and it's sorted into clear sections according to colour and style.
You can occasionally find a vintage rarity amongst the rails, and there are some lovely hankies and scarves to get you through the winter months.
They have a decent selection of books and ornaments but their forte is their clothing range.
It seems to hit the jackpot with  last season's high street fashion donations and like Emma said, you can find good interview smarts in here as well as a good selection of casual clothing.
Worth a browse.
You'll be fighting over the small changing room!

I agree with the other reviewers - this small sized charity shop is definitely worth a browse.
Despite it's small size it's full to bursting with all manner of wares and you can sift through all of the clothing on offer and who knows, you might come across a great find.
In addition to this, the prices are all very reasonable, unlike some charity shops where you end up paying more for an item than it cost to buy brand new.
I also like popping in  here as I feel guilty when I dodge the Shelter people in the street and continuously ignore the e-mails that they send about sponsored charity work.
Sorry Shelter.
