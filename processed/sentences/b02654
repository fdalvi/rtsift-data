Attached to a Shell station and a convenience store of all things.
And it's a drive through.
What more do you need?
And the wi-fi worked great while we filled up the car!
East of Phoenix/Mesa on Route 60, this is truly the last stop / first stop from the nothing that lives between Phoenix and the Superstition Mountains.

Slowest McDonald's I have ever been too.
Nice staff but slow.
Literally sat in line in drive through 10-15 mins at the window on three separate occasions.
If you go inside it's worse.

Packaged food and gas?
Great!
Hot food and restrooms?
Not very good.

A bit slow..

Slow as fudgesicles.

Only because you can't give it a half star.
Terrible employees,  dirtiest McDonald's I have ever seen.
Lousy service.
