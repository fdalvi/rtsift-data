Oh Taco Bell, what can I say about you?
- Fast Service - Accurate Order - Decent tasting food - Smiling employees  What more can I ask for when all I want to do is not be hungry anymore?

I love Taco Bell.
It's my fast food of choice.
This location is like most other locations.
It's the closest to my house, so I go here quite often.
The service is always fast and friendly.
The food is consistent.
As much as I like Taco Bell, it's still Taco Bell so can't bring myself to give more than 3 stars.

Got the Doritos supreme tacos and a grilled wrap with a cherry limeade.
The tacos were soggy and flavorless because of the sour cream.
Next time, no sour cream.
Grilled thing was so-so.
Cherry limeade was tha bomb.

From the 9 years of living here, never have they ever screwed up my order.
Until recently.
I order regular tacos - they give me taco supremes.
I order no potatoes in my double potato burrito - they give me potatoes.
I get the double cantina CHICKEN quesadilla - they give me steak.
I think the employees need to be less self centered & focus on their customer service.
