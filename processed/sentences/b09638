Play place under renovation.
Bad wi-fi mojo.
Service should be a little better to keep the place worth coming to.

I've hit more McyD's in the past week than in my entire life combined!
While on a road trip from San Diego to Flagstaff I found McDonald's $.99 Diet Coke to be my best companion!
The curb-appeal was impressive and the dual drive through was appreciated.
I placed my order, "Diet Coke please" and when the kind drive-through attendance asked if I wanted to add an egg white McMuffin I gladly obliged.
The drive through was quick and friendly.
I was pleasantly surprised the egg white McMuffin was only $2 whereas in San Diego it's over $4!
I've been impressed with the service, cost and speed I've received with McDonald's while on this trip.

I am absolutely disgusted in the manager Erica at this location.
I took my mom to go get her senior coffee that she likes to order.
When we placed her order I was going to get my usual iced mocha coffee but then Erica started interrogating us about who was with me and she asked if I had two seniors with me.
She then asked me if I had ID.
Seriously lady you are carding me for freaking 69 cent coffee???
I will not be returning to McDonalds after this.
( THIS IS AN OLD POST BUT FOR SOME REASON IT WAS NEVER POSTED)

This is a great McDonalds.
It has video games that the kids love.
My grandkids always ask to come to this McDonald's
