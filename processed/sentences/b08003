Unexpectedly well stocked Korean market.
Ignore the boarded up look on the outside and you'll walk in to an oasis of hard to find Korean ingredients.
There was an entire cold case worth of various Naeng Myon (cold buckwheat noodles) -- refrigerated or frozen straight from Korea - perfect for the hot Phoenix weather.
Condiments are taken very seriously here.
Wide range of sesame and chili oil.
Also, I didn't know know that vinegar comes in flavors like persimmons, black vinegar honey, etc.
The household aisle was full of fun goodies for foodies.
Stone pots, steamers and best of all made-in-Japan Benriner (Japanese mandoline) for just $20.
Note that the emphasis here is on imported stuff from Korea so there is only a tiny selection of fresh vegs, and no eggs or dairy product that I can see.
