Wanted to get a custom built gaming PC.
These guys helped me to choose correct parts and assemble it for me.
Very happy with my new PC and their service.
If I get any problems, for sure will call them again.

Well I was caught up in a pickle.
Lol, I don't know what I was thinking.
So I bought a computer from the pawn shop which was at my own risk, now have in mind that normally I would've handle the situation on my own.....
However this case was different the computer I purchased was a all in one HP windows 8.
(I really dislike windows 8)   It was password protected so I tried to do the hard restore on this computer but after many failed attempts I was getting now where but frustrated.
I was very sad and in a rush to get the computer working because I only had a 24 hour window for the warranty.
I tried to get my friend who is a total computer nerd to help but ended up not contacting me back.
Thus Google and Craigslist were my best friends.
I searched many companies and called many places what I really liked about ITU, is the convenience of not having to actually talk to someone if you don't want to, not that I didn't to talk to them but I was at work and cannot accept or receive phone calls.
All of our initial contact was made via email within a 3 hour period I was scheduled to have a tech, or the TECH come to my house and fix my computer.
The reason why I chose them!
Super convenient they come to you, Plus way cheaper then me taking my computer to a shop.

I used this guys for my bakery computers several times.
Fast service, very professional techs.
and they charged me really less what I was expecting.
Definitely I am referring them if you have any problems with your computers and network.
5 star for sure!!!!
