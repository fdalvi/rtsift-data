Dr. Sosinsky is THEE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I like the actual doctors visits.
The doctors however, prescribe the latest prescriptions that require prior authorizations.
This practice does not like completing the insurance paperwork.
I really have a low opinion of them because of this.

Dr Sosinsky the best!
Has helped me soooo much with my MS.
Thank You!

BEST DOCTORS, BEST STAFF.
I have been going to FPN for 5 years now I will never switch my neurologist.
My MS has been helped so much.
I recommend FPN to anyone.
Thee is a wait though but it is worth every single minute.
It is safe to say that you will receive the same amount of attention that you want and need.

Dr.Moshanas is by far one of the best doctors i have ever been to see..he is well worth the wait and the staff is terrific...
