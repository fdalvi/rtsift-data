I have been here twice.
With no complaints.
Always get what I ask for.
Friendly staff.
They offer a wide variety of services, even ear candling.
All services are clearly marked as you walk in.
They also offer a repeat customer punch card.
Tuesdays are set aside for senior citizen discount day.
It is also for $10 haircuts, where normally it's $13.99.
Fireman and people in the military service get a discount everyday.

My wife has been going here for a long time and recommend this place.
I took my son with me to get a hair cut.
Helen was our stylists.
She was very friendly.
Helen did outstanding job on both me and my son.
This place also offers a good variety of other services.
The price of both hair cuts was $ 20 and that included my beard trim.
I can't beat that.
I soon will be coming back here for my haircuts.
