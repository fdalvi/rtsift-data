I haven't been to the dentist in years and keep putting it off.
I am so glad that I found this office, it was extremely professional, yet laid back an made me actually enjoy the visit.
The guy at the front desk was great and helped me qualify for a plan on the my limited budget.
The gals in the back were all good too.
They made the experience fun instead of quiet and boring.
Definitely recommend this place!

I never ever yelp before but I was so impressed I opened an account!
I took the entire family there and was totally not disappointed.
The staff surprisingly were extremely helpful and friendly (unlike some offices I've been to ).
They recommended things for my girls I didn't even know was covered by my insurance!
Sealant what a great coverage I neve knew I had.
Totally worth it!
Everything they did was with care.
All new technology!
Even my 7th ear old mom loved them.
Totally would return

It's been years since I have been to the dentist.
The last time I saw a dentist, my experience was horrible.
Glendale Modern Dentistry has restored my faith in dentists.
Scheduling my appointment was easy and quick.
They didn't make me wait, and their entire staff was so incredibly nice.
My visit was so pain free.
For the first time ever, I don't dread my next visit.
