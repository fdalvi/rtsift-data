I order it for my employees occasionally.
The pizza is what you expect, nothing better than OK.
They throw on an extra $1.50 for delivery charge and the drivers tell us that most goes directly to the managers pockets.
That Sucks.

Gross!
I generally love Papa Johns, but this one is lacking in all areas.
I ordered PJs for lunch and once it finally arrived (1 hour later), it was luke warm and soggy.
Apart from that, the staff lacks any work ethic or customer service.
The three people I dealt with were all rude and careless.
Initially, they ended up giving me a $5 credit.
Ha!
As if I would order again anyway.
