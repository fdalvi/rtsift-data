Went to this Firestone today because my check engine light was on.
The gentleman in the office stated that it could be thousands of different things and that it might take hours to figure out the code.
He told me that it would be a $100 diagnostic fee.
I told him thanks but no thanks.
Went to Autozone and they read the code for free in about five minutes.
I will take the car elsewhere to get it repaired.

I got a quote for my front brakes from Brake Master for $275 bucks.
Walked out of Firstone for only $107.
Quick and easy as well.
Walked in at 830 with no appointment and walked out at 12.
It was a bit of a wait but they had three or four cars in there before me.
It's also close enough to walk to a store if you get bored.
They were very helpful.
I definitely recommend this Firestone.
I've heard that they are a rip off but I didn't see that at all.
I got a great deal and they have coupons online!

I'm not one to review an auto shop but these guys were awesome:) I went in to get my brakes checked and I really felt like I was taken care of and didn't feel like I was getting gyped not knowing anything about cars and all.... LOL.
The mechanic guy that was helping me really explained everything to me and gave me a couple of options that would work for me , I mean i guess it's a little higher than local auto shops but I know that the quality of their work is guaranteed  plus they had a nice waiting area and a fridge full of water!!!
Whaaaat???!
hi.
Hello.
I'll be back :)
