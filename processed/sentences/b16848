Guys, (and some girls - *wink)*,  trust me on this one...keep this review in your wallet until you REALLY need it  This is a real life "Get out of Jail Free" card if you are ever in deep with the wife or girlfriend or BOTH  Just order a bouquet of assorted fruits, assorted fruits dipped in chocolate or Strawberries dipped in chocolates and send it to her work or home or anywhere with high visibility so that she can show it off to her friends/coworkers.
ALso a great idea for Valentine's day, Anniversaries OR, for best effect ... "Just Because it's Tuesday and you're Beautiful"   I don't care how deep in trouble you are, but you are going to be getting some loving tonight, brother.
You can thank me later.

I've never visited their store but they were at the BITE of Las Vegas and I couldnt stop buying their chocolate covered strawberries & apples.
They sell them in bouquets like an arrangement of flowers hence the name.
Brilliant idea and tasty chocolate.

Cool fruit arrangements..but the prices are a little to high

Yummy!
I was able to use my Groupon at this location during our visit in December even though the deal expired in November.
The gals were helpful and accommodating.
I've always given these chocolate covered strawberries as gifts but this one was mine!
They were delicious!
Ample parking in a private lot.
Store is located  in the corner of a shopping plaza... almost missed it so look carefully :)

I got a birthday arrangement delivered to me from this location and not only did it look gorgeous but it was so fresh and tasty!
Their delivery guy was also nice and polite too.
