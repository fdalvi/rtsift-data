Aweful.
You never get a call back.
You never know where issues are when you've brought it to their attention.
And some are not very helpful.
I would not recommend them.

This is the worst Management Company I have seen.
They play favorites especially to people who own multiple properties, They ignore emails and as the other review says they don't call people back.
STAY AWAY
