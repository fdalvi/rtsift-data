This one replaced the location on Howard Hughes (inside FedEx).
It is very bright from the floor to ceiling windows.
The lobby is spacious and there are plenty of tables.
This location has a drive thru and features the new Clover coffee brew machine.
The Clover is a specialty machine that brews Starbucks reserve and exotic coffees by the cup.
The price of the Clover brewed coffee is a little higher but the coffee is of a higher quality.
Although I'll miss the old location on Howard Hughes from YEARS of being a customer, this one is much nicer.

Great location.
Modern free-standing location with great service, friendly people, comfy seating & good parking.

Not sure what other reviewers mean by comfortable seating.
Compared to older Starbucks, the seating in here stinks.
There are plenty of army type metal chairs and stools, and only three armless, stiff upholstered chairs clustered around a teeny tiny table.
Very ultra industrial, with a very, very high ceiling so noise echoes like crazy.
Also, the new "boulangerie" pastries are pathetic.
Everything is tiny and sad looking.
But the good news is, for old timer Starbucks customers like me, I can still get a decent cappuccino.

They have the nicest and most friendly staff at this location.
I'll go out of my way just to go there.
