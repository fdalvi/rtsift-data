Gregor is the best!
If you want a deep massage or have any muscular problem or injury, you won't find anyone better or more knowledgeable to fix you.
I had a bad hamstring pull which no one was able to fix.
Gregor not only repaired the it my body has never felt better.
The other great thing about this place is the customer service.
He is always on Te and the place is clean I will never be able to go any where else.

I was diagnosed several years ago with scoliosis.
Surgery was not an option and physical therapy sessions eased the pain but only for a very short time.
The deep muscle therapy techniques used by Grigor provide much longer relief.
I have been on a maintenance program with Prevent & Fix and am highly pleased.
Grigor is very accommodating, his facilities are spotless and he takes great personal interest in his clients' individual needs.
I would not hesitate to recommend Prevent & Fix to anyone experiencing pain.

I was in such terrible sciatic nerve and lower back pain that walking and standing became a serious problem.
Grigor was recommended to me by one of his clients and I am very thankful that I made the appointment.
The sessions of deep muscle work have helped me to walk and exercise pain free.
I'm even golfing again.
Grigor is accomplished and very knowledgeable about his craft.
With a clean facility and a great personality, I would highly recommend Grigor to anyone looking to get out of pain.
