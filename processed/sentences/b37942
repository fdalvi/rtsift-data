Not the most exciting park ever.
Sure, it's got playgrounds, a basketball court, a volleyball court, plenty of grass space for picnics or soccer games, etc.
But the real reason I come to this park is the OUTDOOR EXERCISE COURSE.
I love it!!
Dips, pullups, chinups, pushups, situps, vaulting and sprinting.. all the equipment is here for anyone to get in a hardcore workout!!
I would have given it a 5-star rating just because the outdoor gym is what really matters to me here, but the lack of a bathroom facility I think is why the park doesn't attract more people than it does, so 4-star rating it is.

There is a play area for little kids right next to the play structure for the bigger kids.
They have swings for both as well.
Neither are covered though and there isn't really any shade.
There is an elementary school next door that has covers over their outdoor toys.
There is a big soccer field, basketball court, volleyball court, and horseshoe pits.
There is a sidewalk that goes around...I haven't followed it around but I have seen kids riding backs and others walking with their dogs.
There is ample seating throughout the park as well as three covered seating areas, two right next to the playgrounds.
No bathrooms.

This is a great park for it's two separate jungle gyms; one for the older kids and one for toddlers.
There are rock walls, horseshoe ring, basketball court, volleyball area all surrounded by beautiful mature trees and lots of green grass .
We love it here!
