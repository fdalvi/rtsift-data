I have the good pleasure of becoming friends with an Iraqi guy named Omar.
I am representing Omar as his real estate agent and we have become chummy as we are scouting for his new home.
Yesterday I asked Omar where we could get some Iraqi homecookin here in Phoenix.
He smiled and we were off to Semiramis.
My top 5 reasons to try Semiramis:  ~ Authenticity:      This is the real deal for Middle Eastern Cusine ~ Hospitality:       Andy is the owner, and it feels like you are eating in his home ~ Environment:   Simple, not pretentious.
~ Friendly:            More than a place to eat.
People gather here for dominoes,   socializing, and food.
~ Convenience:  Located on the SW corner of Bell & 24th street

Come for the food and stay for the people!
Semiramis provides a glimpse into middle eastern culture while filling you up with an amazing array of fresh, delicious homemade food.
While visiting family in Desert Ridge, and reading about Semiramis on Yelp, we decided to give it a try.
We arrived at 7 to a largely empty dining room but were warmly greeted by the new owner.
He retreated to the kitchen to make us some fresh hummus which was absolutely fantastic.
Rather than order off the menu he offered to create a "mixed grill" type of family style plate.
After a short wait, during which we polished off the hummus, we were presented with an amazing platter of grilled meats including chicken (prepared two different ways), steak (again, two different ways), veggies (tomatoes, pickles [totally unlike what you're probably imagining], sliced onion, and green olives [again, totally unlike what most Americans are used to...not at all like the pimento stuffed olives from a can]).
Fresh pita bread accompanied both the hummus and the entree.
Even my sister, who was admittedly a little skeptical when we first arrived, loved the food!
While we ate, some of the "regulars" began to drift in to share tea, coffee, play gin rummy, and socialize with one another.
It's was just as one would expect to see while traveling in the middle east.
Everyone was incredibly friendly, staff and fellow diners alike.
I would encourage everyone to stop by Semiramis.
Is it a little rough around the edges?
Yes but all the more charming IMO.
I think you'll be more than pleasantly surprised at both their hospitality and the food.
If I lived in the area (rather than Wisconsin), I would be a regular at Semiramis!

New rest and owner at this site.
