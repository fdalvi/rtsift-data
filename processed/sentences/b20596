The Kilt Hire Co has been established for almost twenty years, and has stretched its branches out across Edinburgh as a result of its expansion.
It strikes me as being a rather flashy gimmick of a kilt maker, but that's not all bad.
There are some tasteful modern kilts for special occasions available from as little as 40 pounds to hire.
They have a few slightly more expensive traditional offerings, which would be nice for wedding attire.
Although The Kilt Hire Co's forte isn't exactly clan tartan sourcing, their garments are all very well made and look smart.
The ladies kilts are sassy and look classier than the cheap crap you'd find in somewhere like Quiz.
I can imagine the ladies kilts would look great for girls doing gigs.
I can see the kilt hire coming in useful for wedding bands, which I might as well mention since I seem to be connecting this shop to wedding attire with every opportunity.
They have inexpensive kilt pins, modern souvenirs and what I can only describe as zany cufflinks, some of which have the Batman logo branded on them.
For fun loving people who like modern offerings with a twist, and great if you're looking for affordable, smart clothing at the last minute.
