Loved this place, especially the all-you-can-eat Taco Tuesday.
Unfortunately this location closed down, apparently.
The location in Silverado Ranch is still up and running, I believe.
But if you're in the North part of town and need something tasty, I recommend Alfonsos which is right up the street.

This is now a Roberto's Taco and no longer Los Burritos.
The food is still good though!
The entire place has been remodeled and its pretty much brand new.
I always get the same thing.
Carne Asada Fries, Carne Asada Burrito, and Menudo!

Dirty... Floors, tables, waste cans.
Salsa bar was watered down and tasteless.
Cashier was handling the food with her bare hands--patting the burrito shells on the grill and transferring the cooked food to the trays...seriously, this is a health violation.
The food was good, but could have been better.
I am not overly sensitive, but this was too much.
