"Amazing dental work and wonderful customer service from patient care to billing.

I've been a patient here for over 10 years and bring my son here as well.
Wonderful staff from the front office (Tara is very accommodating and helpful when making appointments) to the hygienists (Dan is great with both me and my son and helps to keep our teeth in tip-top shape).
Fortunately our teeth are pretty healthy so we only see Dr. Habashi once a year for exam purposes.
This is also their new location, they were previously located on Maryland Parkway and Silverado Ranch before moving.
If you are in need of expert dental care I highly recommend Perfect Smile!

AMAZING!
I'v been going to them for a really long time and they are always good to me :)

I have been going here for 10 years, mainly for Tara and Denny.
The staff here is amazing and you feel like family until Dr.  DOOM comes into the room.
He told me I had 4 cavities I need fixed right away and what life style change have I had in the last year.
I told him I have been taking better care of my teeth than I ever had before and he told me to stop.
I didn't feel right about all the procedures he wanted to do so I went for a second opinion.
The new dentist said I had tooth decay on one tooth and we would keep an eye on it, no cavity.
I never felt comfortable with him and was treated like an idiot at times.
Wish I would have changed sooner maybe I never had a tooth problem.
He needs to spend more time with his patients and explain procedures in detail.
