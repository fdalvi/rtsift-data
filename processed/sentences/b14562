Went to meat/fish counter & asked employee when he gets his orders of fish in.
He looked @ me like I had 2 heads'  he said Tue (it is now Saturday).
I said ewww, no thank u.
He said but it comes frozen.
I said yes, but Freshly Frozen on Tue, Not Saturday.
I said it smells too.
He said fish does smell, i said Im from a fishing town, fish should smell like Salt Water!!
