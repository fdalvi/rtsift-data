First off I would say that David and Hector were very accommodating with framing my book for my wife which in itself deserved 3 stars from the quality of the framing to the very accommodating demeanor they presented.
I would have given them 5 stars but there were a few reasons why I didn't.
1st off the length of time to get the frame back was about a month and a half BUT I was lenient cause they were in the middle of moving into a new location.
Also I was displeased at the way they never gave me a courtesy call on the progress of my frame.
Some people may think that it's minor but I feel like a professional business should give courtesy calls if their time frame for completion has been extended, not me having to call the particular business constantly.

My first time at Elite Art and Framing and I am more then satisfied.
I needed a piece of artwork framed with a less then 48 hour turn around time and they went above and beyond for me.
First off, my piece of artwork was 3ft tall by 4ft wide.....No place in town was willing to do a rush order for me and no place had the amount of material that was needed.
When I called Elite Art and Framing I talked to David and he immediately told me that he could help me.
David was very professional and in less then 48 hours, David called with my finished product and it came out great!
With the deal that David gave me for the HUGE project I gave him, I couldn't be any happier.
I will be returning to Elite Art and Framing when I need something framed again.
