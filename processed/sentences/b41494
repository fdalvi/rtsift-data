worth the drive to get here.
tons of history in this building.
the guy named Dan knows his stuff when it comes to carrol Shelby.
had a great time and learned a lot.
cant wait to go again.

Who wouldn't want to own a Shelby Cobra?
It's a silly question right?
If you think you don't, after taking the tour you will.
You can spot their new facility from I-15 running parallel to the strip.
There is plenty of parking.
They offer free tours at 10:30 and 1:30.
The tour guide is funny and very informative.
It takes about an hour.
You walk into their gift shop area that includes a huge variety of items.
Around the corner is a drooling display of souped-up vehicles.
Can I afford just one?
Probably not.
But I can dream.
They also have Carroll Shelby's original cobra on display.
The tour takes you into the 'garage' area where the modifications are being made.
I grew up in the Motorcity so it's a little taste of home.
It's a great place to see!

This is a free tour, I highly recommend it.
It is very informative about the history of Carroll Shelby.
Our tour lasted for about 1 1/2 hours.
Our guide talked to about the the history of Carroll Shelby and about a lot of the model cars ($, design, name, etc).
After our tour in the show room, we were able to walk through the garage and see some cars that were being worked on.
We also had a chance to write our names on the garage wall.
The kids especially liked that part.
The gift shop prices are reasonable; we purchased several items.
If you have children with you that are younger than 10 years old; they may get bored.

Loved it!
It's free for the ppl who are wondering!!
Basically a tuner shop for fords with a extremely nice collection of cobras gt's ext.
With a gift shop and sells center for those looking for some performance upgrades !
