This is a place that really helps a lot of women across the valley find direction and help during transitions in life.
Whether you are new to the valley as I am or a long time resident they openly receive you and assist you.
They offer short term programs to assist with finding resources for counseling, education, car repairs & transportation, interviewing, networking, resume writing, self esteem & empowerment, divorce workshops, housing, entering & returning to the workplace, the list goes on.
They provide a clean, quiet & safe environment with some free daycare while using the resources at the location for all women, so as to minimize their worries and assist with getting them stabilized in the communities.
It is the best such program, I have seen in any city and a beautiful environment as well.

What an amazing organization for empowering women.
They have a really amazing mentor program.
The program starts in some coursework and sociology to sort of prepare us.
The classes were a blast and quite useful.
The Mentor I met was incredibly helpful warm and kind and had great insight.
I really miss our visits since I moved away because she was a wise lady with clear perspective.
I really think that the Fresh Start staff went an extra mile and a half by placing me with a mentor who really was perfect for the path that I am on.
Fresh Start also brought in some business training associates and gave out scholarships for them.
I might have participated had I not been working at the time and had conflicting hours.
I was offered a scholarship at the time and I think that any woman who applied herself would qualify.
Fresh start has an impressive job database.
They always had so many wonderful energetic staff who really transmitted a lot of information and light.
Really wonderful organization.
A+++

This place rocks!!
It's all about empowering women...non-profit service all about women..check it out!
