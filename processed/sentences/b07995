This Kmart is huge "old school" huge.
I normally shop at the Kmart on Greenway in Phoenix but due to circumstances we stopped at this one.
This location was clean enough for a Kmart and the employees were nice but they were very low on stock.
It was fairly busy which is nice to see as I remember my mom taking us kids to Kmart back in the day for clothing needs etc.

By far one of the worst shopping experiences I've ever had.
It's ghetto and the service is incredibly horrible.
I'm never going there again.
I was there for 45 minutes just to walk out with nothing due to lack of lines being open and the horrible staff.
I highly recommend that you never go here unless you want to get frustrated.

I have alot of nostalgia for this Kmart.
I remember Saturdays when I was a little kid shopping here and eating at the Little Ceasers.
Today, this store is in decline.
It looks like there hasnt been a makeover here since the 1980's.
The problem is the area it's in, sitting next to seedy motels filled with druggies makes people not want to come here.
Kmart in general is dying.
This chain was once the kings of retail before my time.
If you brush up on your history you will know Walmart and Target came along to overtake them.
Kmart, if it wants to survive from its 20 plus years of decline, needs to take a look in the mirror and fix the issues with customer service and marketing.
When it comes to prices, Kmart is reasonable, but ask yourself why people would drive an extra distance to go to Walmart or Target?

This store was great.
Very clean, well stocked and helpful friendly employees.
I would recommend going to this store for nice merchandise at good prices.
