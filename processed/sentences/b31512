First visit is a bit pricey, but if you keep a regular monthly appointment it's quite reasonable.
I didn't have to wait forever to get my 18 year old Jack Russell seen and Mike did an excellent job.
JRTs shed pretty badly but Mike made my puppy shine and amazingly got all the extra hair out.
As a result, my dog is much more comfortable (as the heat comes to Phoenix) and he (Mike) easily accommodated a few creaks and groans my ancient puppy suffers.
I have no info on the other groomers, but Mike I would recommend highly.

My Mother In Law got her puppy back after spending most of day getting groom and they cut her eye so bad I had to take her to the vet.
This place should be shut down.

Cut my dog's eye BAD.
Had to go to vet.
They took pictures to show liability was all Puppy Land.
Puppy Land kept our dog for 8 hours because they cut her eye so bad & actually tried to glue the eye back together.
This place needs to be shut down before they kill someone's dog.
Very unsafe!
