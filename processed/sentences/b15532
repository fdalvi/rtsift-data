Now known as Zen Cleaners.
They offer the best dry cleaning service in the area.
A little higher in price but well worth it imo.

Friendly service and fairly priced!
I had a bridesmaid dress altered and was very happy with the quality of work and speed of service!

Had an emergency qipaow dress situation and needed it made smaller in a hurry.
Went on the rec of my bridesmaid and I'm v happ that I did.
Good pricing and fast service, my dress was ready faster than I expected it could be!
