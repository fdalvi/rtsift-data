As a recommendation from one of my friends, I met with Connie to consult about purchasing my new home.
Immediately, I was able to set up a meeting and she listened to my requirements and concerns.
She understood what I wanted in my new home and calmed me down with her confidence.
Connie clearly knows the Las Vegas market, trends, and how to negotiate.
She was very hands on and always available.
It was a pleasure working with you.

Connie has a very solid approach to selling your home.
The techniques with social media and marketing my home was second to none and produced results.
I had numerous inquiries that led to offers.
She was very friendly and personable and everything I looked for in an agent.

Connie is very good at what she does.
She went above and beyond on service and puts her clients interest first.
The entire selling process for me was extremely smooth and she was was there to communicate with me day or night whenever I had any questions.
All in all, I cannot imagine how a real estate agent can be more helpful than Connie was to us.

I was looking to sell my home but did not know any Real estate agents and that is when I started searching online.
I had sent many emails contacting different agents but Connie was the first person to get back to me.
She is full of enthusiasm and makes things fun.
Her attention to detail is highly commended and is one of the best real estate agents in Las Vegas.
