My best friend came to town and we snuck away from hubby and the kids one night to try Carino's.
I was honestly wanting Greek food at the time but wasn't  in the mood to drive and Carino's is in the neighborhood.
We went to dinner rather early because we wanted to be home in time to catch a program on television.
So, maybe our experience had a lot to do with the time we were there.
It was OUTSTANDING!
The place was not busy at all.
Only two other tables were occupied.
Our waiter was awesome.
He was friendly, funny and took time to explain some of the dishes to us.
My friend had a rather specific request for her order and they were able to accomodate her with no problem.
The food was delicious!!
I couldn't finish mine but had them pack it to go so I could have the rest later.
It was soooo good!
The atmosphere is very cozy and comfortable.
I'm looking forward to going back with my husband at some point.
