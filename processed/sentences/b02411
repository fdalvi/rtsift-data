I came here for my routine cleanings and to have a mouth guard made.
My student dentist is sweet, easy to talk to, and explains what she's going to do.
Yes, you will get probed here and they'll do a lot of other things that normal dentists probably won't do to you, but its sorta neat to learn about it.
The facility is brand new and the first dental school in Arizona, so support your future dentist!
=) Prices here are lower than your regular DDS because they're in training and it will probably take a bit longer to have the procedure done.

Gadz, now there's THIS place!
I went over here last time (before today) to have my teeth cleaned by a student at a reduced rate, since I don't have dental insurance.
The cost was $35 plus $9 for the fluoride treatment that they pushed on me, for a total of $44.
This represents about a $21 savings over the cost at a regular dentist.
Passable so far.
*  Well, it was 26 miles each way from my house, but hey, I'm saving a little money.
The trouble was, girl took TWENTY X-Rays on my first appointment, taking most of 2 hours, & that's all she did!
:-O  *  I made another appointment to go back for the scaling & polishing, & drove over there again.
This time, girl took most of two hours to clean my TOP TEETH ONLY, & that was it!
:-O  *  On my THIRD visit, she took most of two hours, & cleaned my bottom teeth.
=============================  Ok, so here's where it all ended up:  *  NINE hours spent, including driving time!
*156 miles driven!
*  No, no, no!
Even if you live closer, SIX HOURS in the chair to have your teeth cleaned is not ok!
I recommend that everyone avoid this place at all costs!

Student dentists are caring and compassionate and eager to do their best.
They are also humble and smart enough to ask for help when they need it.
NOTE: I'm biased because I'm a student dentist here.
The faculty here is amazing.
If you have lots of time and not as much money, this is a good option for you.
Upsides of being a patient here: you have multiple eyes looking so you know you're getting the best of care and it's less expensive than going to a private office.
Downsides of being a patient here: appointments can take up to 3.5 hours long each time and there is a long process to things because it is a teaching clinic.
