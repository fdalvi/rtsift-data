It's actually quite a good sign for a shop when I either a) avoid it completely or b) walk in very quickly and then run out wringing my hands in despair.
a) and b) are indicative of a very poor sense of self-control when confronted with pretty things.
The Owl and Lion does this to me.
You see, I like owls.
I also like paper and paper related things, such as books and notebooks and postcards.
They have owls on paper.
You know what, they have owls on bags!
And owls on t-shirts.
You know what I'm getting at.
It really is just a bit too much for an addict like me.
This shop, though, isn't just a shop, but also a gallery.
And not only is it a shop and a gallery, but it also runs workshops in book binding and print-making.
The place is uniquely alive.
Alive and kicking in that it's keeping book-binding going and it's doing it well.
If you're on the Grassmarket, don't miss it.
If you're not on the Grassmarket, find the Grassmarket and don't miss it.

The Owl and Lion is absolutely my thing - I live for finding shops like this!
It's a gallery on the Grassmarket that is more like a shop selling prints, pocket notebooks, t shirts and cards designed by two art graduates.
The talented duo have come together to print off many a whimsical doodle of owls, lions and cats, the latter of which has got me excited.
Not only have they started producing notebooks depicting historic people as noble cats, but they have prints of these brilliant, quirky drawings, too!
I also liked their collection of t shirts, but can't divulge too much information into that since I am buying a special person a present from here in the near future.
They come at a price but as Brucey Forsyth said the price is always right - they are definitely worth it.
If someone wants to buy me the Rabbie Burns cat print I'll love them forever!
Any takers?
No?

The "Bear with accordion" T-Shirt went down a treat - Stuart loves it!
My work is done.
