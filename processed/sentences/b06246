New owners took over.
The pizza sucks now!

Let's be straight- you only get Little Caesars because you are broke, desperate for something fast to eat, throwing a party, or you're fond of mediocre pizza.
I fall into the broke/desperate to eat categories.
Little Caesars isn't terrible....
I've certainly paid more for crappier pizza (by accident, of course- not because I enjoy torturing my wallet and taste buds).
But I don't think there's really anyone out there that says, "Man, I sure could go for some Little Caesars right now!
"  Basically, it's tasty enough to make you think your $6 was not wasted.
Nothing more than that.
For this particular location, we've never had to wait for a hot-n-ready and we are usually in and out pretty quickly.
The employees are your typical fast food employees- not the most professional service in the world but fine enough to make a cheap pizza and swipe your credit card.

hot and ready took 30 min and then they gave it to another customer!
Has a "C" from the health dept!!
The frame is hidden behind the dipping sauces!
So much for fast cheap pizza!!
REFUND!

What can I say?
Five bucks for a pizza?
You can't beat it.
Granted, it's not Chicago Style or something you'd expect to find in Italy, but for the money and convenience, it's hard to beat.
Add some crazy bread and wings and you've got a pretty darn good meal for next to nothing.
If you want to spend a little extra and get their deep dish, you won't be dissappointed.
All in all, a good meal at a great price.
They have also taken phone orders from me in the past, which even adds to the convenience.
In a pinch and can't decide what's for dinner?
Pizza!
Pizza!
