New location!

Anytime Fitness is a great gym!
They have great rates and the staff is super friendly.
Unlike any other gym I've been to Anytime Fitness gives you a key pass to enter the gym whenever you like.
This is great because it means that whenever I have the itch to work my hammies I can pop over.
Unlike like other gyms however they do not have group classes.
Instead in some locations they have a room where you can pop in an instructional video that works like a group class.
Though I generally do not take advantage of group classes, I would like the option.
With that said however, I have no major complaints with Anytime Fitness.
The gym is generally empty which means that there is no waiting for other members to get off the equipment.
All in all I would recommend Anytime Fitness!

For the price per month and selection of machines and free weights....a solid 4 stars!
Like every gym, this place can get crazy busy between 3 and 6pm.
But if you can avoid that you might have the place to yourself.
I go in and work out some Saturday and Sunday mornings and I am the only person.
It is great!
I mostly use the free weights and treadmill, and their equipment is always clean.
Plenty of TVs on with the remotes easy accessible to change a channel.
Friendly staff willing to help you out with any need.
I would recommend this location to anyone just looking for the basics.

I went here with my girlfriend a few times.
Seems fine.
I don't have a membership at any gym so I can't compare but I can't say anything bad about it.
