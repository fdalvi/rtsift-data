Really friendly owners.
Empanadas are made right after you order them so you are not getting something that has been sitting around all day or something microwaved.
I have only had their mozzarella empanadas but they are good.
If you buy two empanadas you can also get a mate tea.
Usually parked in front of Memorial Library, rain/snow or shine.
