I have my mail sent to this location and I enjoy the convenience of a mail store and the options you have that keep me away from the US Post Office.
The staff here is always friendly and they remember me all the time since I am in there daily (usually at 5am before they open to get my mail)  It is cool to have a key to the front door to access my mail box at any time.
I wish these were still mailbox ext because they would at least take my pre-paid FedEx shipments but now they are in a battle since they no longer offer FedEx for obvious reasons.
I think as a consumer we get the short stick on that deal but I still like having my own location where they know me and I can get in and out for any postage needs.

I have my business mail box here.
The price for a mailbox is average, but the service and willingness for the employees to help are WAY above average.
The mail part of the store has 24 hour access (They give you a key).
Making it really convenient to pick up the mail on my time.
They accept mail and packages from ALL carriers (make sure you fill out the right paperwork so they can sign for your packages).
You can only pick up your packages during business hours, but they can send you a text or email if you get a package -- so you always know when you have one.
Lastly, you call call and have them check if you do even have mail before making the trip.... saving you time.
A little tip - I even have a few of my personal (non-business) packages delivered here.
Living in Phoenix during the summer months, it gets HOT.
Having my packages (esp if food, wine, etc) delivered here allows them to be a little more  temperature controlled...rather than sitting on my hot porch all day!
