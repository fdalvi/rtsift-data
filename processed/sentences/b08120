What a RIPOFF!
My husband has psoariasis and we came here to get his cream.
They had to order it and it cost us $30.
Way overpriced.
We have since realized that we can get the same cream at our local Fry's Pharmacy for only $4 AND they always have it in stock.

Customer service here is good  and i think automatic refill for medication is so convienent since i am forgetfull sometimes.

The people who work at the pharmacy are nice and do their best.
As usual there is a line sometimes to get medication.

These are horrible pharmacy people they would not fill a pain prescription for my dog who has cancer and needs his meds every 72 hours.
Manager even got involved and still would not fill it even though I have been to other CVS pharmacy's in Tempe near my work.
Would not call other pharmacy nor my vet to do her "research".
Ended up having to drive 60 miles round trip to Tempe to get it filled and spent over 3 hours.
My dog suffered horribly that day and night because it takes 8 hours to kick in which I told the pharmacist and almost had to make the decision to put him down.
Luckily this morning because of the great Tempe location he is feeling better.
But all could have been avoided if the lady pharmacist at this location filled my dog's prescription and did her "research"!
