A very large clean store with a great select of meats and produce.

Great store I love the service;  everyone knows my name & is extraordinarily helpful..  .Barb, Sharon, Tammy all help me each week & Tammy made me laugh the whole weekend w/her adorable cap in the Seasonal Isle.
I would love to share the pix but no capability here;  however I posted it to my Facebook site.
One of the prettiest stores in the valley.....love to shop there!!

I was tired, late and in a hurry when I left my purse in a shopping cart in the parking lot.
I didn't notice until the next morning and I panicked because I had a large sum of cash from selling furniture.
A young man turned in my purse and not a penny was taken our of it.
This kind of honesty made me so incredibly grateful.
Kudos to this young gentleman and the staff at Fry's for being honest, kind people!
Yes, the actual store is lovely as well and the beauty is greatly enhanced by the staff.

Horrible customer service skills.
Linda that helped us need a attitude adjustment.
Won't go back to this location.

We love Frys!
Moving in from Key West, where you learn not to expect a lot from.
.well, anything.
Frys is a great store.
Always clean.
Friendly staff.
Good prices.
Lots of selections.
After living in Key West, where there are only a couple of grocery stores to choose from (and very little selection on the shelves) this store is almost perfect.
There are other stores in the area, but we're 100 pct happy with Frys so why switch?
