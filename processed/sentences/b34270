Eislea cut, highlighted and styled my hair today and I have not been happier with my hair in years.
She listened to what I explained I wanted and gave me one of the best highlights and cut.

If you wanna get FTD (Fresh To Death), hit up my girl Eisela.
She will hook it up!

Came to Chandler to Visit friends.
I was recommended by friends to get my haircut by Eisela.
After spending about an hour with her and getting my hair cut and adding color I couldn't be more happy.
Everyone should take a moment and have her cut your hair.
You will never go to anyone else again.

It has been one year since I found Eisela and she has been the ONLY one that has done my hair since then.
She really listens and has given me perfect cut, color, and style that is professional, easy to maintain, and I just plan LOVE.
If you haven't tried her yet, don't wait any longer!
