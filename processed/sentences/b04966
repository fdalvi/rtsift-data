I like American Eagle's jeans.
I, however, do NOT like this AE location.
I always feel like I'm inconveniencing the sales associates by asking to try something on.
When I ask for a fitting room, I'm greeted with eye-rolling and huffing.
I'm sorry you're busy.
That's what having a job entails - actually doing work.
And the reason you have a job is because I shop at AE.
So you can get me a fitting room when I ask nicely.
Once, I actually had a female salesperson tell me that, no, she's too busy to get me a fitting room.
Really?!
If that's someone else's job, direct me to that person.
Don't just say no and turn your back to me.
That's so rude.

Visited this place yesterday with a good friend.
Man, why haven't I shopped here before?!?!
Oh yeah, that's right, because I used to be big and didn't want to spend money on clothes that didn't suit me.
LOL  I came here and immediately zoned into a cute outfit.
Red pants and a striped oxford shirt which made a really great combination.
The only problem was that it was $100!
OMG, I can think of so many other things I could buy with that amount of money.
Still the combination was amazing and the best part was, I could fit into a 32 pant size and a medium shirt!
Man that's awesome!!!
The store is FILLED with clothes.
You must take your time and go through the finds.
The array of jeans are great and overall the store is super clean.
This may just be my new favorite store!
If I can afford it...

Worst customer service ever.
Love seeing employees wandering around, doing nothing while many people stand in line.
I also love seeing employees on their cell phones on company time.
Must be nice to have a job where you can do nothing and get paid for it.
As a manager of a retail store, I was pretty disappointed in what I saw.
Never going back.
