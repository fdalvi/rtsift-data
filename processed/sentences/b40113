I have to say this Colombian spot located on the southwestern corner of Sahara/Torrey Pines Dr, carries one of the most unique flavors in Colombian appetizers.
I would strongly recommend #6 Patacon de Carne desmechada!
You can't go wrong with it, and comes along with a very humble friendly staff!
Enjoy!

Arepa Xpress is the only place in Vegas to get your fix of so many great Colombian treats!
I strongly recommend the Colombian style hot dogs, definitely a must!
The best hot dog you've ever tried, I promise!
It's colombian fast food at its best.
U can even call in or text your orders ahead of time so they can have them ready for u.
And now with the cold weather upon us they will bring the orders out to ur car, can't beat that!

I have never had an arepa before.
And now, I am a big fan, we especially like the cilantro sauce served with it.
The vegan arepa with the plantain and avocado is worth going to find this truck.
Prices are good, the people are nice and we are happy they have such a lovely vegan option.

Food is amazing!!!
Typical Colombian Arepas and much more!!
I highly recommend it, can't wait to come back!

Authentic Colombian food and it tasted amazing as well!
Don't let the little truck fool you!
Highly recommend it!
Will definitely be coming back.
Had the salchicha (hot dog) and it was perfect!

Great and easy place to stop for a bite right on my way home from work down W Sahara.
It was my first introduction to Colombian food and now I try to go once a week!
Really friendly and helpful staff; they make you feel like family.
If you're a first timer, they'll explain the different items and make recommendations, but really, everything is delicious!
