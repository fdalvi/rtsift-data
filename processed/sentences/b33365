Worse food and service I've ever experienced.
Extremely rude people work here!
They were busy and a nasty waitress added drinks we never even ordered then was rude when we questioned her.
She removed the drinks then was a complete bitch!
I suggest you pay as you order for drinks or really check your bill before you pay!

Best bar in gold Canyon...  Stevo or Dee best night bartenders!
Jennifer is a awesome day bartender as well!

This is a great place and the pizza is ok. We miss The garage

I've come to terms with how much I like this place.
Despite the fact that I only go here two months out of the year, the truly amazing wait staff remembers me (by name) and takes care of our whole party.
The owner is one of the nicest gentlemens, you'd ever have the pleasure to meet, and the prices aren't bad at all.
Thanks Firehouse!
We heart you!

Food is terrible.
Simple as that.
Service is decent though.
