My FAVORITE place to shop!
I like this location better than the one in Tempe Marketplace... even though they supposedly have the same stuff, I always find more things to buy here.
They have all sorts of cute clothes, from dresses and jeans to shoes and sweats, all at great prices!

This is a great clothing store.
Trendy, and affordable.
This is the kind of place you stop by on a friday afterwork to get your outfits for whatever you got going on that weekend.
Lots of cute accessories too.
I've never come here & left empty handed.

This is my FAVORITE place to buy long pants, shoes, leggings/stockings, and clothes in general.
I always find what I need here, if I'm looking for skinny jeans, you have them, if I'm looking for a nice jumpsuit, same.
I envision what I want, and imagine, and you so often have it.
Rarely do I leave disappointed.
I like the Tempe and the Mesa stores, however, always Mesa is the best.
Last time I was there I was disappointed you didn't carry the fishnet nude tights you always have in stock.
I am a performer, and this was a staple for me, and don't know where to go now.
This is my only complaint, and when I talked to the manager of the store at that time, she wasn't helpful.
The manager in Tempe is SO warm and engaging.
He will order things for you, he is helpful and honest with his opinions.
Sometimes the Tempe merchandise can be rather cheap looking, some of it, but it has the same shoes and accessories, and a wide variety, I have still found great items at both stores.

Absolutely love this store .
The clothes are so fashionable and affordable.
Great for a night out.
Does anyone know if they are still at this location??
Ireally miss shoppi g there and hate to buy online.
If anyone knows where I can find this store in AZ please let me know they were closed and the one in Tempe is closed as well.
