I just dealt with these guys and had a great experience.
I found a car on Craigslist that they were advertising and through the entire process I was waiting for the typical tactics of a small car dealership.
I was waiting for the salesman (Mark, by the way) to get pushy, for them to bait and switch me on a piece of junk, for hard tactics by the finance manager... etc...
I kept waiting and waiting, then before I knew it I had keys in my hand.
They all were extremely professional, swift, educated, courteous.
I cannot say enough good about them.
I actually commented to them as I was leaving that I expected a battle and was pleasantly surprised.
Now...
I will say that while I was there I did see a few unhappy customers.
The ones I saw were all a part of their "buy here, pay here" program.
Frankly, and I am not pulling the Mitt Romney card, but if no one else will loan you money why make the life hell of someone who will?
There were an endless parade of people coming in and reading them the riot act because their car payment was due!
The other review I read on this place is trying to nail The Car Company because the car was a POS.
All of these places operate the same way - they go to an auction and buy a product that they can make the most money on.
Most times they only have a car in their possession for less than a week.
It is not a sinister plot that car dealers devise to buy junk cars and dump them off on some poor bastard.
I dunno....
I could go on for days on entitlement and etc... but not the point of the review.
The Car Company treated me well and seem to be a solid company.
If they have another vehicle that I like, at a reasonable price, I would certianly buy from them (cash) again.

Well, to start off i had a great buying experience here, the vehicle is not a new mercedes, it is what i can afford.
The buying process was simple, i got the vehicle i needed at the payments I needed.
They seem to have a nice selection, quite a few vehicles, maybe 70....the vehicles were reasonably priced and affordable.
I would recommend getting a vehicle here if this is the type of vehicle to get , a used car.

The business said it was open today on a Sunday.
We went around 3pm and business was closed.
They had around 40 to 50 cars on the lot ranging from BMWs to Chevy malibus.
Most cars in the 5k range were pretty best up with visible body damage.
Some of the nicer cars did not have prices listed on them.
They had signs everywhere that as long as you have a job they will finance you.
I gave 1 stat cause I was irritated I drove there and no one around.
Also lots of crack head people walking around.
