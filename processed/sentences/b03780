Customers of Razmataz: Paul Bunyan The Jolly Green Giant (you know, on the cans of corn!
) Dom Deluise  Yes.
BIG furniture for big people.
And while they have a tremendous selection, nothing really fits my style.
Lots of beautiful carved wood pieces and plenty of wrought iron.
It's sort of goth meets Aspen meets Lane Bryant.

Holy crap Thomas is spot on, hilarious.
The first thing I thought when I first walked in this place was "I'm feeling mighty little".
Big heavy pieces for sure, dark woods, carved, unique.
You need a big space to show off this stuff.
Lots of Mexicali knicker knackers.
I still have a few pieces with me here in Hotlanta, but it doesn't quite fit anymore....
Anyone want to buy it?
Shipping is only $5,000....

Drool.
This place is my own personal furnishing heaven.
The first time I walked in here I think I literally gasped.
I have always tried to describe my ideal decorating scenario and the best I could come up with was things you would find in a castle.
Yeah..like a castle.
Cuz I'm goth like that.
And..voila..Razmataz.
As for it being furnishings for big folks, I am ok with that.
In fact, I am wiling to get fat in order for it to look more appropriate and to scale.
One problem.
My eyes are bigger than my wallet.
Champagne taste on a beer budget if you will.
But a girl can dream....and drool...Ahhhh...anyone wanna help me put together my Ikea entertainment center?

I will never make another purchase from this company ever again!
The company tried to deliver damaged furniture to my home and then gave me the run around about processing a refund when I refused to accept the items.
After 5 phone conversations, they agreed to refund me for refusing damaged items.
I cannot recommend this to anyone.

Loved Razmataz too bad they closed... Great stuff, I found a near by place Holland Boone, 90th st. And bell...
Awesome merchandise helpful staff.
