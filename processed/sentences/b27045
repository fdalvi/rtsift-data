I like the owner, we race each other regularly.
Always has what I need in a pinch, and is the  closest to hendertucky.

My husband will sometimes have me stop into Champion Motorsports to pick up parts he needs to fix one of our dirtbikes.
I work nearby, so it's more convenient for me to do so then for him to do so.
I never mind doing so because the staff is always so friendly and helpful.
The prices are very fair and Eric, the owner, is very knowledgeable.

Good service, VERY knowledgeable, friendly to talk to, no attitude either.
Champion is also a Vespa dealer, and if you have Piaggio / Vespa scooter questions you will get straight answers here.
The fact that they have the patience to deal with the Italians on your behalf automatically gains them 3 Stars, and I'll tack on Star #4 for the great attitude I encountered.
