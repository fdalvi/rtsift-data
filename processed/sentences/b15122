Has been our bank branch for 20 years.
Hard to get to see a personal banker so we use the B of A up the street in Raintree and 101.

This is our local B of A which we like a great deal.
The one major drawback is the size and location of the branch.
During the 11 till 2 pm high traffic hours I try to avoid it like the plague.
Parking, and just getting into the lot is a bear.
That said, the folks who work there are very friendly and helpful and is the reason I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 3 stars.
Too bad they cannot move the branch about 30 feet north or enlarge their present local!

Bank of America customer for a decade until a few months ago.
This particular branch is less than warming, as have most of my experiences been with BofA.
Granted, not all experiences were bad.
The time I went in to close my account the banker was relatively nice, although obviously bored.
The last time, today, was after I went in to discuss my recently deceased father's account.
(I have been working with another branch - 20th st and Camelback - they are GREAT, friendly, kind people to work with).
Without going into more detail, the lady I talked to at the Raintree location was quick to point out how unhelpful they would be since I was no longer an account holder and I had just closed his account.
Nor did she want to look into anything or offer any other options than get out and good luck.
She was very good a pointing out what I could do if I did have an account with them though and all the hoops I'm going to have to jump through now that I didn't.
All with a smile on her face.
Condescending customer service.
Take your business elsewhere.
