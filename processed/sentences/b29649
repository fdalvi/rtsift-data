If I want to make it a quick trip (avoid long lines), I head here after work.
Good selection of food and produce.
I went here once with my husband who quickly noticed my peeps working here- he's got "pinoy-dar.
" Well-stocked, less strange customers, and not too many panhandlers in front of the store; also located in a strip mall.

Out of the three Vegas/Henderson area stores I've visited in this chain, I like this one the most.
The aisles are split in the middle, like my hometown location.
They've seemed pretty well-stocked both times I've visited.
Oh, and the bathroom is pretty well-kept.
The only issue I've had was that they only had one cashier working on this particular busy late Sunday afternoon, so it took a little while to wade through the line.

I'm here all the time what can you say it's a 99c store.
They do have fresh produce everyday last min items for a good healthy dinner.

Sometimes this place a cluster you know what.
The lines can be long, the people can be rude, the aisles a little messy.
However, I just can't pass up the bobby pins here.
I mean why go to another store and pay $3 for bobby pins that either end up lost of broken?
Pfff, $.99 for bobby pins sounds like a win-win for me.
Not everything is a deal at the $.99 store but if you are good shopper you know what to buy and not to buy.
I once scored chiobani yogurt for less than $.50 and the expiration date was still a bit off.
So it wasn't old product or product I had to hurry up and eat.
I love coming here to buy candy to fill up my candy jar.
And if my son needs a new coloring book or something just to entertain him - I know I can count on the $.99 store to provide me with inexpensive options.
