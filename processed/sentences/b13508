1310 KXAM is a great local AM talk radio station...  Used to be the home of Glenn Beck before his britches got too big...
Anyway, the afternoon food show with Kim and Don is fantastic (11am-1pm, M-F).
Dave Ramsey is a financial genius, and Neal Boortz has his head on straight.
The Gutsy Geeks computer show Sunday's at 4pm is my favorite (me being one of the hosts).
Give KXAM a try - AM radio lives on!

KXAM 1310-AM has some great shows.
Bob and Sheri in the morning are entertaining and fun to listen to.
Jeffry O'Brien at night has some very funny stuff, and on Sundays at 4:00, "The Gutsy Geeks" are worth tuning into if you haven't heard them.
There's three of them and once you start listening, you don't want to stop because you never know what's going to happen.
They talk about Linux and Open Source stuff, not the usual Windows blah, blah, blah.
It's a fun show.
Brian and the Judge is okay weekday mornings, and I like Kim and Don's Culinary Confessions.
I like Dave Ramsey's financial advice, but he includes too much religion for my tastes.
But then again, if Jesus saves, I guess we should, too.
Good programming, KXAM.

KXAM going silent 4-15-09 - ceasing operations  http://boards.radio-info.com/smf/index.php?topic=123907.msg1005996  " this matter is a done deal now and in the hands of lawyers... so sadly... there is nothing more to be done here.
"  "I take it that the Gersons decided that the land that the towers sit on is worth more than the station license itself, and that's why they're surrendering the license to the FCC instead of donating KXAM to someone as a tax write-off.
"  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KXAM_(AM)  "The station features local programming during the midday with "Culinary Confessions" with Kim and Don, Matt Gerson, and in the evening "The Daily Blender" with Jeffry O'Brien.
KXAM will cease operations on April 15th, 2009.
Culinary Confessions will move to AM 1440.
