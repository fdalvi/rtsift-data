Everything in this dollar store is really a dollar.
It comes in very handy for every day things.
They have name brand cleaning supplies that i buy often.
Also, they have lighters for candles, wrapping paper, gift bags, and even stuff for wedding decorations.
Sometimes, it's a hit or miss thing, they sell name brand plates, bowls and cups.
If you need something cheap come here!

Has everything a dollar store usually has.
This one is larger than most I've been to on the east coast.
Much more clean and organized than the ones I've been to on east coast.
I think I may have actually been at the Sun City location.

A good variety of merchandise and all for the bargain price of a dollar.
I find myself coming here more and more recently for all sorts of stuff.
Great, especially when you don't wanna splurge on things like cough drops, toiletries, greeting cards and batteries.
Gotta check 'good by' dates obviously and usually have no hassles.
Staff is always courteous and helpful.
These stores are increasingly popular with people not just from the middle class.Best bang for the buck for a savvy buyer.
I also shop at this location because of proximity

They have a good selection of merchandise including brand name items, too.
I love coming to this location because the sales associate, Julissa always greets me with a smile and is willing to help when I can't find an item.
She consistently promotes the store's weekly sales items and surveys.
She is the reason I continue to shop at this location.
