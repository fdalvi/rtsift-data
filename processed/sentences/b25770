I purchased a vacuum from this store and I am soooo happy with my purchase.
I got a great price and excellent service!
These guys are very knowledgable and when I called with a question, they were very helpful and courteous........... unlike some establishments, that forget about you after you "pay the money"!
Thank you Paul and Garren...........I probably won't need to see you for a while but you will get my business, when the need arises!

I can't say enough nice things about the professionals at AZ Vacuums.
I took my Riccar vacuum in for servicing because it was making a high-pitched squealing sound.
I've had it repaired in the past at a different Riccar dealer, but AZ Vacuums is closer to my home, so I thought I'd give them a try.
I left my machine for the gentleman to diagnose the problem and I had a phone call telling me what the issue was before I'd even made it home.
It turned out that a part that enables to brushes to turn had broken, causing the whir.
Naturally, the didn't have the part, but assured me they could find it.
After waiting only 30 minutes, I received another phone call and they had the part in hand.
I was told they'd purchased the part from one of their competitors for $39.95 and that would be the sum of my bill; no pick-up charge, no labor, etc.
My vacuum was rebuilt with the fresh part and running like new the very same day and I couldn't be happier with the service I received from AZ Vacuums.
I highly recommend them for any vacuum repairs or new vacuum sales.

I have done business with this store over the years after they were recommended to me by a friend and they have always been extremely helpful!
They have repaired my previous vacuums at a reasonable price and timely manner.
Also, when I was in the market to purchase a new vacuum, they were very thorough in helping me find a vacuum that fit my use best.
They had me test out a few vacuums in their showroom and I ended up choosing a Miele.
It is by far the BEST vacuum I have ever owned!
I would highly recommend their services to anyone!
Very knowledgeable and affordable!
