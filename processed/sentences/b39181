This restaurnat just opened this week.
The owners are a young couple who recently relocated from Europe and converted a closed pizza shop into a great bistro.
As I approached the opened door early one morning to see what was going on, I was overcome by a wonderful aroma of sauce cooking on the stove.
I picked up a menu and told the owner I would return.
I placed an order a couple of days later and I have to say the food was just great.
The pizza was probably the best I had since leaving NY many years ago.
It certainly was better than anything I have tasted in Scottsdale.
The taste was unbelievable.
The salads were large, fresh and were big enough to share.
There were several people eating at the tables and the pasta dishes looked delicious.
I was sorry I only ordered a pizza and salad.
That ok since I know I will be back there in a couple of days with my family.
The prices are very reasonalbe and I want to try everything on the menu.
Best of luck to the new owners and I will see you soon.

Amazing, amazing food.
After living in Italia for some time, I've come to know proper Italian food - not an easy find here in the states.
This menu was perfect.
The white pizza I had was delicious with real flavors and not greasy.
Great crust.
I was full, but had to try the pasta the rest of my family had - that too, best pasta I've had in Scottsdale.
I'm so excited to have found this place.
We will be back!

If you like family-owned, authentic Italian, you will love Basil & Garlic Bistro.
The San Daniele pizza is phenomenal, and the pastas are great.
Start with the antipasto salad and finish with the Nutella pizza.
Wonderful place, nice owners.

We just returned from dinner at Basil and Garli Bisrtro with doggie bags filled for another delicious meal.
Needless to say, portions were plentiful.
Filled and satisfied we were thrilled to fine a new neighbor gem tucked away off the main big streets.
The atmosphere is small, warm and friendly.
the owners are delightful.
We shared an antipasto salad (large enough fo four) that was very tasty.
Two of us had eggplant parmigiana .
They said it was the best they ever had.
I had the Rucola e Gamberetti, a mild shrimp (large) pasta dish with fresh tomatoes and angula.
Delicious.
Another guest asked them to special order a pizza and the chef was nice enough to accommodate his request.
It seems to be a great place for a quick slice of pizza , a sit down lunch or dinner,or best yet - take out and enjoy it at home.

A new and very friendly family-owned italian casual restaurant.
The pastas are outstanding and the portions are very generous.
The antipasta salad is great, ditto the pizza, but my favorite was the eggplant parmigiana and my husband loved the lasagna.
The fresh, homemade sauce was delicious.
A great addition to the neighborhood!

Not surprised the buzz has started about this place.
I've been there twice already and the food is excellent.
Quiet location, neighborhood  feel, friendly and family owned.
Afraid to post how yummy everything is because it will be too crowded next time we want to go.
The only drawback of this place is that there aren't enough seats, and once word gets around about the homemade bread, robust stromboli, and delicious Bolognese sauce, the line will be out the door all the time.

Best family owned place!!
The most amazing pizza my husband and I have had.
Will be back many times

OMG!!
The new best kept secret!
The pizza is to die for.
.the best I have had in AZ.
The crust is handmade and tossed.
There is plenty of cheese.
It is heavenly.
Everything is homemade and wonderful.
The tiramisu was fantastic and the piece we received was more than generous.
It was creamy and delicious.
Again, made in house.
I just can't say enough about this local family owned bistro.
The owners just moved here from Europe.
They are clean, neat and eager to please.
The prices are reasonable.
We will be making it our " go to" place for sure.
Many thanks to Claudio and Nadine for all their wonderful hospitality and attention to quality and quantity!
Kathi & Mark G.

The food and the service were excellent.
My son just loved the Nutella pizza for dessert.
Would definitely recommend the place.

Love supporting local family owned restaurants!
We had a great dinner here tonight and we will certainly be back.
Excellent Bolognese sauce!

We visited this little restaurant last week and it was great!
It is a family owned business and everyone working was super nice and eager to please.
The pizza was delicious and fresh and some of the best I have had.
Everything is made in house and you can tell.
We also got the pasta bolognese which was good.
While waiting for our takeout I saw a plate of spaghetti and meatballs go by and it looks amazing, something I will have to try next time.
The only cons would be that it lacks in decor and is very small, but something that is easy to get over since the food is outstanding.
It is also very clean (which is a must) so if you are looking for a casual place to grab dinner, or just to get takeout, please give this place a chance!

This is an Outstanding little restaurant with some of the Best Food I have ever tasted.
It is operated by a very nice couple who is a great chef and they provide great service.
A friend and I found this place via Yelp!!!
We had no idea this Hidden Treasure was located in the edge of a neighborhood.
They do not not serve wine but you can BYOB.

Excellent little family owned restaurant tucked in the corner at 92nd St and Poinsettia.
They have been open 7 weeks and seem to already have a crowd of regulars dining in and picking up.
Delicious pizza with an amazing, light and crispy crust.
Had the San Daniele white pizza with fresh mozzarella, prosciutto, tomatoes and arugula.
They have medium or large.
The medium is huge!
The antipasto salad is large enough to share with 3 people.
You can BYOB but there is a $4.50 corkage fee.

I found Basil & Garlic Bistro on Yelp today and decided to try out this new place based on the reviews.
I had the 2-slices of pizza lunch special.
The food was really good.
Loved the cheese and thin crust.
Price was very reasonable.
The owners are really friendly and I look forward to trying the rest of the items on their menu.
While I was there a waiter from Grimaldi's stopped in to grab a couple of sandwiches to go.
Interesting!
The location is about 1/2 a mile north of Shea on 92nd Street, and currently there is road construction hindering traffic, but not too bad.
I look forward to trying their homemade Tiramisu!

This little Italian bistro is an unassuming, tucked away gem.
We went there after looking at the other reviews on yelp, and were not disappointed.
My coworkers and I ordered the vegetarian sandwich, a calzone, the cheesy fries, and tiramisu.
First of all, the portions are VERY generous.
The calzone, for the average person, would be enough for 3 meals.
I was with a 20-something man who never has an issue clearing his plate.
Well, this time he did.
The fries were covered in what was the tastiest, garlic-infused mozzarella.
It is also a big helping.
The vegetarian sandwich came on beautiful bread and was overflowing with marinated and cooked veggies, topped off with that delightful mozzarella again.
Then there is the calzone.
We ordered a vegetarian calzone (made to our specifications).
I already mentioned the size (epic!
), but the flavors involved are a beautiful combination.
Many times, a calzone is pretty straightforward.
Cheese, sauce, other fillings, etc.
This was such an intricate pallet of flavors, it's clear a lot of thought, and skill, went into its creation.
Last, but certainly not least, was the tiramisu.
It's a big piece, creamy, great flavors-none of which overwhelm the others.
Seriously, this place is great.
The owners, Claudio and Nadine, are charming and welcoming (Claudio is the Sicilian chef, and talks to customers while bustling around in the kitchen).
Make sure to not be in a big hurry, because this quality (and quantity) of food can't be rushed.
The prices are very reasonable, and it was an overall delightful experience.
We plan on going back very soon!

Excellent food and even better service.
Very down to earth place where you can spend an evening and enjoy delicious food!

I rarely write reviews but this family-run restaurant tucked into the northwest corner of 92 and Poinsettia is exceptional.
The pizza is perfect and reminds me of real Brooklyn pizza with a perfect crust, the right amount of cheese and served hot.
I recently had the mussels in red sauce.
It may have been the best I've ever had!
My prediction is that we'll be hearing more about Claudio and Nadine.

I am a self proclaimed foodie and I don't mess around when it comes to food.
Basil and Garlic Bistro is the real deal.
I have been here three times and have ordered three different dishes, all were fantastic.
The first time I was here I ordered the meatball sandwich and it was so flavorful, lightly toasted on the outside, the meatballs were perfectly seasoned, the cheese was flavorful and of great quality.
I was so full after eating the first half that I saved the other half for dinner.
I didn't want to ruin the delicious sandwich by reheating it in the microwave so I turned on the oven and patiently waited to once again experience the intoxicating scent of an almost fresh meatball sandwich.
It was just as good as the first bite!

We arrived in Scottsdale this June from New York.
Coincidentally, the owners of Basil & Garlic Bistro - also from NY - had arrived here this Spring.
Allow me to say this local Italian Bistro is "pure heaven" - fresh, clean, superb food, incredibly excellent Pizzas, marvelous congenial service AND the real deal.
Economical and excellent prices, great menu variety + Italian Food as it should be.
Lucky for us it's only a few mile drive and WE will be regulars.
Take note - there is only seating for 34 and at times, there will be a wait = well worth it!
Better yet, just drop in on a weeknight - as we did yesterday... no wait - just BIG smiles.
To date, in my first 3 months here, Basil & Garlic Bistro is the VERY BEST value I've found and I'm certain you'll be as equally pleased here!

This place is kinda far from me, but I stopped in to check the place out since it changed from Two Guys Pizza or whatever it was.
I went in after lunch, and it wasn't super busy - but they still had a steady stream of customers coming in.
Neighborhood locals who were apparently already all hooked on their food.
The owners were an adorable young couple - both originating from other Countries before moving here.
They were fun and charming.
We had a nice chat before I got fed.
I like them and hope they do well... going by the other reviews here, I have no doubt they will - even in the unassuming little corner location.
So I ordered a Cheesesteak because my diet lately has been pizza and cheesesteaks and I need to cool it and start eating more salads and going to the gym, but a cheesesteak sounded good and that's what I wanted, so shut up!
Anyway, the sandwich was unlike any cheesesteak I had seen... they make their own bread for the sandwich, and it seems to be based on the pizza crust dough.
It was one of the most unique cheesesteak sandwiches I've had and easily in my top 5 in Phoenix.
The meat was tender and flavorful - perfectly seasoned.
Now, I know that most cheesesteaks in the Valley are made of the same meat - most restaurants get their sliced ribeye meat from the same vendor.
The reason some places taste better or worse is due to a number of factors - how they store the meat, how they season it (if they even season it at all), and how they prepare it.
That being said - this is definitely a place not to be missed.
I asked another patron to see their pizza they were picking up as she was leaving and it looked and smelled amazing.
If I wasn't so full and if it wouldn't have been ridiculous, I might have ordered one of those to go so I could eat it for dinner or breakfast or whatever.
I'm glad I didn't because I was full until I went to bed.
I didn't feel bloated or anything - just full as in not hungry.
I also saw a calzone being prepared - gigantic/epic.
This is a top quality restaurant.
I'd drive out of my way to come back here... probably will.

Claudio and Nadine, we want to thank you for such a pleasant meal last evening.
The Chicken Cacciatore and the Chicken Marsala were outstanding.
I enjoyed being able to watch Claudio work his magic in the kitchen.
The aroma's coming our way were outstanding.
We will be back and we will be bringing our friends.
Deborah Brewer & Michael Slominski

I am beginning to see a trend here.
First Pesto Prima Café.
Now this.
If Yelper Max A says it is a 5-star restaurant, then a 5-star restaurant it is!
And B&G Bistro's food is exactly that.
The wonderful smells greet you at the door.
Add to that a very hard working, charming young couple, Claudio and Nadine, who are at the helm, and frankly, what's not to like?
Simply put...at the time of this writing, this place has barely been on the map more than 3 months.
It already has the whole neighborhood talking and supporting it.
I saw person after person come in, pick up their food, and tell the owners that they heard about them from somebody.
They don't need to advertise but I shall Yelp regardless.
I can already see longevity and expansion in their future.
Antipasto salad.
Decorated with attractive rolls of excellent tasting meats and cheese.
Add more shredded cheese and very crisp romaine.
Top it with still warm, freshly grilled red bell pepper in olive oil.
Then top it with his house balsamic dressing.
Get it!
Then make sure you sop up the dressing with slices of his own freshly baked bread.
And try not to roll your eyes into the back of your head while you moan in delight.
Chicken Marsala.
Tender, generous, moist chicken breast, pounded then seared to perfection, then topped with copious amounts of sautéed mushrooms in a Marsala sauce.
You get to name your pasta, Mr. B chose Angel hair.
An excellent choice.
Cheese Steak Deluxe.
A sandwich that is destined for fame.
Start with thinly sliced, tender beef and a touch of pepperoni, add well sautéed mushrooms, onions, some of those magnificent grilled red bell pepper slices, and some great melty cheese, then drop it and all its juices into one of his freshly baked Italian rolls.
Juicy, flavorful, huge.
Wouldn't change a thing.
There is no pretense to his food.
He cooks with simplicity.
He cooks it fresh.
He loves his customers and already knows them by name.
There is a very special vibe here.
Plenty of left overs to revisit tonight's meal.
And we will be back.
Maybe to try a pizza from his stone oven.
All I can say is, if you dropped everything and ran over here now, it will not be a moment too soon, and you will be happy you did.

This place is AMAZING!
It is exactly what I look for when I want to eat out.
Wonderful family owned place!
We had the Stromboli.
The dough was light and baked to perfection.
The tomato sauce was just like my grandmother's sauce.
Lovely owners as well.
I am going back on Friday with more people so we can order pizzas!
I can't wait!

Basil and garlic caught our attention when it popped up in what used to be 2 men and a pizza.
I wasn't expecting much more than the average pizza from their predecessors but they blew away my expectations.
We have eaten here 4 times in the last month and have loved it every time.
The pizzas are great, our favorite is the diavola.
They are huge with lots of toppings.
The menu says 16 inches but I measured it once and it was well over 17".
The crust is soft but chewy and one the best I've found in AZ.
The couple that runs the place are very friendly and the kind of people that make you want to go back.
They have a small seating area so you can dine in or take it home.
Either way the service is fantastic.
Highly recommended if you are looking for something that is not a crappy chain (dominos, papa johns, etc).

Ordered their pizza and it was delicious.
Fresh ingredients and very good crust.
We will be returning to try other items on the menu.

Quiet, little neighborhood spot.
Food was great and portion sizes were large.
I like the  family owned atmosphere.
Will definitely go back, i really want to try a pizza next time.

Small strip mall location just south of Cactus on 94th (at Poinsetta cross street).
Very good crispy yet chewy crust on pizza slices, savory tomato sauce, and enjoyed the fried mushroom appetizer as well (large portion for the price).
Service was very personable and warming.
Prices were reasonable too.
Only about 8 tables here, so I'll go during off hours or just do takeout.
Would kindly recommend they get rid of the tablecloth condom covers - just clean the tablecloths or put glass over them.
The condoms don't exactly enhance the atmosphere.

Everything about this place is great!
Super laid-back and excellent food!
The staff was wonderful!
The Sicilian pizza is awesome - and huge.

It is great to have a local restaurant that is not a chain.
All four of us enjoyed our meals immensely.
I would highly recommend you check it out!

Great food and even better people at this charming little spot.
We were treated like dear friends.
Everyone else in there seemed to be regulars, being greeted by name, etc.
We waited forever for our dinner, but it was well worth it.
We can't wait to become regulars, too!

My daughter raves about this place and I thought it would be a great Friday to try it since I didn't want to cook.
I'm so glad I got lazy.
We had to wait a bit for seating since all the tables were filled.
The restaurant is a small quaint place with about 9 or 10 tables (I recall 8 tables which seat 4 and 1 or 2 that seat 2).
We ordered our meal family style so we could try several dishes.
We started out with the Calamari.
It was a nice plateful that was easily shared with our party of 6.
The calamari was fried to perfection with a very light batter and a side of marinara sauce.
It was served with fresh baked homemade bread which gave us a way to 'sop' up any extra marinara sauce.
Our entrees came shortly after.
We ordered Vongole on spaghetti (they ran out of linguini) in white sauce, Quattro Formaggi penne, Rucola e Gamberetti on sedani, and the Quattro Formaggi pizza with pepperoni on 1/2 of it.
All I can say is WOW!
WOW!
WOW!
I'd be a fat cow if I lived by this place... Each dish was so flavorful and portioned for this family of 5 adults and a kid.
You could tell there was no shortcutting on any of the ingredients that were placed into each dish.
You can taste the love, pride, and warm hearted delight that the owners want to share with each and every bite.
We topped off our evening with homemade spumoni, cannoli, and tiramisu... Well worth ALL the calories - no regrets!
My daughter and her boyfriend are regulars to this restaurant since moving just under 2 miles away.
Claudio and Nadine recognize them and made sure they came by the table after dinner was done.
Claudio did visit each customer table through the time we were there too.
The husband and wife duo were so friendly and down to earth.
I love that they like to make their customers feel valued and appreciated for visiting them.
I can easily see how my daughter fell in love with this bistro and the people that run it.
All in all, the rainy day excuse (aka lazy) was the BEST reason NOT to cook last night.
HIGHLY recommended and I WILL be sharing this little diamond in the desert.

Stopped in for lunch after yelp search nearby.
Very impressed.
Everything was so fresh.
Four of us ate.
1 had shrimp salad.
Perfect.
One had meatball sub.
Perfect.
One had antipasta.
Perfect.
One had egg drop spinach soup.
Amazing!
Great service, nice people.
Will be back for sure.

This is a small restaurant with big flavors and highly recommended to everyone looking for classic pizza, calzones, stromboli's, sub's or Italian favorites from an east coast style pizzaria.
The owners are extremely engaging, husband is from Palermo, Sicily, Italy (probably the capital when it comes to Italian pizza makers in America and his beautiful wife is from Germany---should be interesting this summer for the World Cup).
They check a few times with customers to ensure quality and complete satisfaction while dining.
Once you try their food you'll probably quickly become a regular, as I recently did.
They offer house made bread that is unique, served for meals and used for the sandwiches offered.
The pizza dough is expertly prepared and cooked to a nice crispness, the pizza sauce is not sweet like you find at many other local pizza establishments and the mozzarella cheese is the highest quality that melts perfectly on your pizza and sandwiches.
The Bistro is a little hard to find but located in a small strip shopping center off 92nd street between Shea and Cactus (formerly 2 Men and a Pizza).
If you don't live nearby, it's well worth the trip from anywhere in the Scottsdale area if you're looking for the pizzaria you remember from anywhere east of the Mississippi.
I have not tried the entrees yet but they do offer quite a few on the menu and have seen numerous satisfied customers.
I hope you get by to meet the new owners soon.
Please remember, this is a BYOB establishment that does not serve alcohol.
Enjoy, DeLaurentis

I was shocked to see this place have a five star rating on Yelp.
It must be the owners posting over and over again because there is no way it should be rated that highly.
We got takeout, thank God, because the interior of the restaurant reminded me of a 7-11.
No offense to the owners, but the dining area floor plan is a mess, complete with garbage bag table cloths and a massive Pepsi machine in the middle of the room.
I ordered Chef Claudio's Favorite.
The sauce and pasta weren't bad but the ham was basically cold cuts you would get from  Safeway...not what you would expect from a 5 star Yelp restaurant for close to $20.
My wife ordered the Quattro Formaggi, very much overkill on the cheese and had a very chunky consistency and gritty texture.
Again, I hate to bash a place but this is a 2 star restaurant and these 5 star reviews are absolute nonsens

It's obvious that whoever wrote 5 star reviews for this place has never eaten real authentic Italian cuisine.
To start, the place is lit with fluorescent tube lights and is brighter than most convenience stores.
Hardly the kind of lighting anyone wants to eat dinner in.
To continue on about decor would be long winded so I'll say this, if yelp gave a decor rating it would be -1 star.
My girlfriend and I enjoy eating out and this was not even close to what we expected.
The antipasto salad was generic with under roasted peppers and deli sliced meats that were worthy of a grade school sandwich on white bread.
The pizza, "the chefs special", was greasy and undercooked.
Nothing fresh or authentic about this place.

So here the deal..
The real deal..
If you know anything about great food.. Then you will try this place.. And become addicts like we are!!!
We are originally from Chicago and have been in Scottsdale for ten years but miss a really good neighborhood restaurant..
So many restaurants and so many disappointments..
But not here.. Top to bottom of the menu fabulous.. Lovely young couple with great ideas and wonderful food.. And consistency..
Try them and you will see for yourselves..And if you come on a Wednesday or sat night we will probably be there as it's that good....  Real  people  enjoying a wonderful food.
Once you go you feel like you are part of the family.. And that's a big deal for us..  Can't wait to celebrate their first new years eve:)

First, I will say that some of the food here is very good.
However, when I ate here on a Saturday night with 3 companions, it was pretty disappointing.
First, they were out of lasagna.
This is an Italian restaurant at 6:45 on a Saturday night.
So I ordered a pasta and seafood dish another diner was enjoying and it was excellent-- lots of mussels, clams, and shrimp in a marinara sauce tossed with pasta.
Two of my friends ordered one of the many pizza combinations but were served the quatro fromaggio instead, not what they ordered.
It was pretty salty, too.
There was no apology, just a lecture by the chef to the undertrained teenage waiter.
I think that Saturday night should have an experienced server.
Just my thought, as one who has waited tables in the past.
The grilled chicken salad was very good.
The calamari appetizer was OK.
The sauce tasted like it was from a can.
My preteen liked the chicken sub and fries.
Mainly, it was the very poorly-trained service that was the problem.
There should have been an apology for serving the wrong pizza.. That would have gone a long way.

I have come here several times with coworkers for lunch and been delighted each and every time.
The owners, Claudio and Nadine, are wonderful and friendly and their presence has always added to the experience--they are a young couple with beautiful little children and it is easy to tell how passionate they are about creating delicious food.
I highly recommend the calzones--filled with amazing ingredients of your choice and HUGE.
I've sampled many of my coworkers dishes including the veggie sandwich, which is loaded with an array of exquisitely roasted vegetables, and loved them all.
One note--to the person who found the Quattro Formaggi too cheesy--you may want to reconsider ordering the dish titled 'Four Cheese' if cheese is not your thing.

I eat here on a regular basis.
Food is always great, owners are very friendly and make the experience even better.
Just had the lasagna for the first time.
Definitely not disappointed.
I love their sauce.
Ordered a tray for my New Year's party.
Definitely try this quaint Bistro.

If I could give this place zero stars I would.
I waited 55 minutes for a medium pizza and an order of calamari.
Not once did they bother to tell me that they were busy or that it would be a minute.
Their service is a joke and poorly organized.
Then to top it off, the pizza came out completely wrong and the owners wife tried to tell me that's what I ordered.
What a waste of an hour.

The food is delicious.
Veal Saltimbocca, Veal Limone, and Pasta Boscaiola were what we ordered.
The deserts cannoli and tiramisu were very good as well.
The service was excellent and the owners treat you like family.
Don't miss out on this cute neighborhood restaurant!

You might not like Basic & Garlic Bistro.
It is about as far removed from fine dining as you can get without being fast food.
The restaurant is small and simply decorated, but it is clean and it has tables with tableclothes and comfortable chairs.
The couple who own and run it are young and probably make mistakes from time to time.
But they are enthusiastic, they try hard, and the food is REALLY GOOD.
You can get pizza by the slice for $1.85 plus 35 cents (that's no typo) for each topping.
Get one topping - they put on plenty.
These slices are 1/8 of a 16-inch pie, so two will fill me up but I could eat three or four if I had to.
That makes for a pretty cheap dinner.
That's the best buy on the menu -- other choices are moderately priced but not ridiculously inexpensive.
The pizza is very thin crust, fairly crisp, and covered in a standard mozzarella cheese.
The pepperoni topping was the usual, the sausage appeared to be homemade and was mild but delicious, and the meatball was just about as good as it gets.
It all worked together to make a fine old-time pizza.
My wife had a sub which came on freshly baked and crusty bread that had her insisting that I try a piece because it was SO good.
When she got full, she ate the sandwich filling, which she said was even better than the bread.
This is a neighborhood affordable Italian eatery.
Cut them some slack.
For what they try to be, they are as good as it gets, and that is plenty good enough to have me coming back.

If I could give this place zero stars I would.

What a waste of an hour.

I want to start out by saying it was my first time coming here and definitely not my last.
This place by far has the best pizza in AZ.
I tried the Quattro Formaggio (4 cheese) pizza and the blend of taste along with the dough texture made this pizza lights out.
I also ordered the basil and garlic pasta with linguini which was delicious.
This place is a great family owned business where they treat everyone like family.
This is a hidden gem and eventually it will become everyone's favorite.

I was looking for a sandwich for lunch in the area and stopped here after finding it listed on Yelp.
I'm so glad I did.
The owners are a husband and wife and are very nice.
I ordered the Florentine sandwich (chicken, spinach, garlic, and provolone cheese).
It was huge and delicious (I'm saving half for later, it was so big).
Now I have to come back here sometime for pizza because the bread my sandwich was on was SO-O good.
I can hardly wait to check out that pizza crust!
Authentic Sicilian food--you can't beat that :)

Amazing pizza slices for lunch.
Super nice husband and wife owners.
Bring your own wine and dine on the new patio.
Will be going for dinner soon.

Omg, I'm so glad we found this place and I can almost walk to it (if I weren't so lazy), otherwise I would have to move closer.
This is the kind of place you look for when traveling, an unassuming, down-home, authentic hole in the wall that only the natives know about.
I took my Mom here last week to celebrate what would have been Dad's 94th birthday.
Kinda a sad-happy day, but aside from the great food we found Claudio the owner-chef who is from Sicily and of course speaks Italian...this thrilled Mom having someone to speak Italian with.
I also enjoyed listening...it was great and took our minds off the day.
Forget the decoration/decor...un-important...you are here to eat real Italian food.
We both had eggplant parmigiana, Mom had the ciabatta sandwich and I had the plate with rigatoni.
The ciabatta was huge, seriously big enough for 2 people to share and was only like 7 bucks.
The dinner plate was also huge, I only at half there, at some for dinner at home and the rest for breakfast the next day.
Yes, folks...that's one of my tests for good food, if it tastes too the next morning for breakfast...it gets a star.
Why was it taking so long to cook?
Well I gotta think Claudio cooks to order, because this was the absolute BEST eggplant parm.
I've had (except for mine :-).
The eggplant was sliced thin and lightly breaded, the sauce was to die for, and the cheese was excellent.
The rigatoni was excellent as well.
Plenty of parking No liquor license but 30' away is a deli you can buy beer or wine and you can byob.
Out-Door Seating Credit Cards  Definitely going back and has replace my other neighborhood Italian restaurant.
I will be working my way down their menu for sure!

We went for the first time as it's in our (new) neighborhood.
The food was very good and certainly reasonably priced, however it took FOREVER for us to get the food - over an hour for a calzone and spaghetti dish.
This is a lot of time to wait for an adult, much less our seven year old.
Will try again based upon the food and prices, but another slow experience like this one and it will be our last!

My mom found this place and it is a hidden gem!
We went for dinner with my two year old and everything was amazing.
My mom and I split the grilled chicken salad and between the two of us we couldn't finish it.
We ordered penne with red sauce for my daughter and thought we might get a couple of bites, but she ate every bit of it!
Everyone that works there is really friendly and we have already been back for round two!

Scottsdale has a ton of fancy restaurants (which I don't mind) but we were looking for something more "local" and stumbled upon Basil & Garlic Bistro thanks to our handy Yelp app.
To get to this one year old restaurant, we came off E Cactus Rd, and we had to drive right into the residential neighborhoods.
Once we saw the small plaza where Basil & Garlic Bistro was located, we said to each other that there was no way we would have found this place just by driving by because you just don't "drive by" the area where Basil & Garlic Bistro was located.
Onto the food.
it was all amazing.
The chicken steak deluxe has a wonderful mixture of meat, veggies, and cheese.
There was a HUGE chunk of pepperoni in each half of the sandwich and my fiancee commented that "this is the amount of pepperoni some places put on an entire pizza!
"  My fiancee's Vongole pasta with red sauce and clams was one of the better pasta dishes we've ever had, anywhere.
And it was only $14, definitely a great deal because you're at a family owned establishment in a local neighborhood.
We finished off the meal with homemade tiramisu which was not overly sweet and did not have an overdosing of rum.
It was decorated with drizzles of chocolate sauce and cocoa powder with bits of whip cream on the side.
I come to Phoenix every so often for work and would definitely count Basil & Garlic Bistro as the place I'd try to come out to for dinner when my schedule allows me to make the drive out there.

Authentic, yummy and wonderful staff!
This place is the real deal!!
Sauce is great, sandwiches awesome too.
We gotta go back for dinner!

What a great neighborhood find.
Outstanding food - made from scratch with fresh ingredients.
Severs were so personable and worked hard.
Treated our little tot great too.
Byob!
Can't wait to take advantage next time we go.
Our table shared pizza, lasagna and Stromboli.
Really excellent crust - and very generous portions.
Stop reading and go here now!

Have come back multiple times often ordering seafood pasta dishes which are always generous and tasty.
Their daily specials are almost always worth ordering.

Thank you yet again Yelp for helping us find another hidden gem...  Definitely wouldn't have just stumbled upon this place.
This isn't your typical overpriced Scottsdale chain garbago restaurant... instead it is a casual, no-frills, family owned place that makes quality food- Quite a refreshing surprise that you would imagine to find in Little Italy in San Diego or LA.
Enough of my ramblings...
Overall - Great tasting food at an even better price!

Omg, omg, omg.
If you are from the east coast like I am, you will understand all the omg's.
East coasters are always on the eternal search for food that is "just like home".
I am from NY and so are the owners of Basil and Garlic Bistro.
There was an immediate connection.
To say the food was "just like home" is an understatement.
Fugettabouit.
Now don't go in expecting anything fancy.
This is a tiny little joint pizzeria style.
Just a few tables with extremely minimal decor.
In my opinion, that is part of the charm.
No airs about so the food needs to stand on its own.
I had the linguine and clams and it is just like I used to get in queens.
Just right.
My mother had the chicken parm dinner, which is not actually on the menu but they advised me that most heros (sandwiches for people who don't speak NY) can be made into dinners.
To say it was excellent is also an understatement.
Dad had the meatball hero which was perfection and we took pizzas home which are exactly what we are used and long for.
All heros are served on their delicious bread which is also given to the table when you first sit.
Amazing.
For dessert we ordered the cannolis as you can't fully judge a place without having their cannolis.
Did I say OMG?
Oh yeah, I did.
I can't wait to come back to Basil and Garlic Bistro.
I will be dreaming about it until then.

Go with one of the specials everytime!
The chef here is amazing!
Just had the bruschetta chicken pasta and it was so good!
The chicken was moist, the tomatoes and fresh basil with mozzarella cheese tasted so fresh and delicious.

Excellent food!
Great family place to eat.
Wonderful owners.
Will be going every spring training and when we come visit family!
