Fast, affordable, good driver, solid music, clean car - great experience.
Thank you!

This bus is awesome.
I was with a really, really rowdy bunch... there were about 12 of us.
6 boys 6 girls, one stripper pole, one disco ball - need I say more?
We arrived safely to our destination, and the driver was a great guy.

First this company had three drinks.
Cran and vodka, capt coke and bud lite in a can.
If you are 12 and have no idea what you like to drink this bus is for you.
If you have a preferred drink avoid this company at all cost.
They bring you to a few clubs and leave you at the last to fend for yourself.
The "bartender" acts like a drunk teenager and takes photos for his page.
Then as they drop you off they ask you to write a good review and tip them.
Here is a tip.
Get more drinks better music and more adult oriented bartenders.
I felt robbed of my $80.00.
I could have saved money staying in my hotels club.
If your just turning of age there are better ways to experience Vegas nightlife than the so called party bus.

I just wanted to say THANK YOU!!
I decided to go with LVPB the minute I talked to Junior... What a nice guy!
It was my daughters Sadie's dance and there was a few pick up and drop off's, for the kids and he totally worked with the schedule the kids were on, since he already had someone else booked he gave us a great deal and I'm all about customer service and they delivered!
Thank you again!
Will definitely go with this company again!
The kids loved it!

1.5 hours late, then proceeded to lie to us about our actually reservation time being later to cover the fact that they oversold their schedule.

Horrible service.
To and from drivers changed every pickup/dropoff resulting in inconsistent pickup time/location.
We had the bus for 3 nights.
Pickup was late one night and bus literally broke down the other.
Save yourself the hassle and money--stay far far away from this service.
