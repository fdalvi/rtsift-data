If I could buy everything I ever needed at Walgreen's I would.
It's fast, in and out, short lines, and I always buy way too much stuff I don't need when I come.
Maybe that's a downfall, but they seem to place items that appeal to me in obvious zones.
Way to go Marketing Department!
Most people are pretty darn familiar with Walgreen's, so I will post the particulars of this location.
They have amazing wine clearance sales.
10 dollar bottles for 2, 20 plus dollar bottles for 6 or 8.
They must be clearing out inventory, but seriously these deals are great!
They seem to clearance out other liquor as well.
Check the front displays of the liquor section and each are labeled with a yellow discount price tag.
Haven't had a bad bottle yet!
Check out at the cosmetics counter if you buy any makeup or personal hygiene items because they archive manufactuor coupons and just scan them for you.
Review your receipt as well because they add a savings on that for your next visit (around 3 to 5 bucks off).
Friendly staff and everything you need (and don't need!

Guess what?
Sterling wines on sale: 3 bottles for $10.
This is a spectacular deal.
Just don't go buy them ALL or I won't share such tidbits anymore.

Walgreens in general is a bit on the pricey side on......everything, but I must say if there is something new out- or limited edition- they have it.

Kimmie in photos is the best in customer service!
Just when we were wondering what happened to the concept of customer service, Kimmie and the manager restored our faith!
