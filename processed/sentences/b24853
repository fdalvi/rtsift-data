I was pleasantly surprised with this office.
It is very small and the office seems to originally have been a apartment/condo.
However, the staff and dentist were phenomenal.
They explained everything they were doing  and took their time.
I didn't have a wait at all and I wasn't rushed out.
My only complaint is that because the office is so small you can hear things going on with other patients.
There was a patient a little ways down from me having some big work done and he was under anesthesia...I heard everything.
On the upside it was nice to hear that even when the other patient was vulnerable the staff was still very professional and kind to the patient.

dr patterson is awesome!

Very pleased.
The decision to have a tooth actually pulled is a tough one to make, and is not one to make lightly.
Dr. Patterson did his best to try to talk me out of it (that's good), but I really didn't have a choice budget-wise.
The tooth was broken and it had decayed to the point to where I had an abscess.
He quoted me a price of a grand for a root canal and a crown--that's a great price, but still much much too high for me at this time.
He charged about $250 for the extraction, which was in my budget.
Because the tooth was a molar, it wasn't going to be as much of an issue losing it as it would be any of the teeth in front.
Great, careful, attentive work.
After the procedure was done (and Dr. Patterson worked hard to make it as painless as possible), I got a prescription for a painkiller and an antibiotic.
I healed up very quickly.
I have been in the Valley now for about a year and a half and can finally say that I have a dentist.
Finding a good one can be tough.
If you're looking for one, let me recommend M&M Dentistry to you.
