With the large amount of sporty 'old man' pubs on Easter Road, I was pretty excited when this place opened up as a gastropub.
We finally found time to head along and try it out a few weeks ago.
There was a pub quiz on so it was pretty busy and we had to sit at the bench in the window, which was fine.
The stools were a bit high so made eating slightly awkward, but alas!
The atmosphere was very laid back and chill.
The pizza's are BOGOF if you buy two drinks, so we decided to check them out.
The mister had a black pudding & egg pizza which was delicious!
I had a chorizo & something pizza which wasn't really anything to write home about.
We were sat next to two American girls who'd been in the night before and said the pear(?
) salad was amazing, although the soup they had the night before wasn't fantastic.
So I think the pub may be struggling a bit with consistency when it comes to food.
But they are fairly new still, so hopefully all these things will get ironed out.
Looked like a good selection of beers and spirits.
Something to please everyone.
Nicely decorated.
Would definitely head back for a drink... verdict is still out on the food tho.
Might give them another chance, but not in any hurry.

The mash tun is an immeasurable improvement over the old Utopia!
The food is fantastic as well.
2 pizzas for the price of 1 with 2 drinks.
This is Dominos style deals but these pizzas scream quality.
The prices are very reasonable!
Highly recommended!
Also try the Cullin Skink!

Just been in for the first time.
So much better than the previous incarnation.
It's now probably the best pub on Easter Road.
Long overdue!
Well done guys.
