Rally's isn't a "fast food" in the sense that you food is flying out on a tray 10 seconds after your credit card is swiped.
It took about 3 minutes for my meal to be prepared with generally nobody else here.
So if you are in a rush... go to Taco Bell or McDonalds.
With that said...
I ordered the Roadhouse Bacon Burger.
It was good.
The bread was even flatbread, which made it more than just standard burger.
Fries are awesome too.
No ketchup required!

The food here is like a worse version of Arby's.
Waste of money!

The food they serve is made to order, so it takes a little longer than most "fast food" burger joints.
Not to worry..
It's well worth the wait.
I've eaten here a handful of times.
They are pretty consistent with their service and their food.
This weekend, I ordered via the drive-thru window, and when I got home, my fries were still crunchy.
That's always a plus for me.

Since leaving Florida I missed Checkers (what Rallys is called over there), and boy was I thrilled to find it in AZ!
It's been a while so I couldn't wait any longer...  Ok, so at first glance this place might not give off the best vibe.
Who cares.
The food is good.
Tried the double rallysburger, w/ fries and a choc.
milkshake.
The burger is actually somewhat similar to Burger King (in a way), but better imho.
The choc.
milkshake was the bomb diggity fo shiggity.
I mean I drank that sucker down.
Others around me had nothing but good feedback so I guess it's safe to say I will pay another visit in the future.
Forget the negative reviews.
Hit the drive-thru if you have doubts.
The food is good!

best fries around and awesome prices
