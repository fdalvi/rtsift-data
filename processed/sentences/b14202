After all the rain this year (and the thought of last years 3 acres worth of weeds on my 1 acre lot)  I decided to save myself the hassle of pulling a million weeds and gave these guys a call.
Much to my surprise they were reasonably priced so I set an appointment.
They were super punctual, very professional, and had more knowledge about weeds than I thought possible.
Even though they wouldn't let me romp their golf-cart around I'm still giving them 5 stars.
I would be in serious weed-hell right now if it weren't for them.
Now I can sit back and laugh at my neighbors and their giant weeds...

Ants!
Ants!
Ants seemed to be everywhere!
I tried all the usual home remedies I could think of but for 3 days straight I would find a line of ants from the front door of my salon to a certain trash can located right under my tea station.
Not good, not good at all.
I called pretty late in the work world, around 7 pm but I was able to wrangle an appointment for the next morning.
The were able to squeeze me in around 10:30 and I haven't had a problem since.
They even gave me extra ant traps, no extra charge.
I will be using them again for all my spraying needs.
Thanks guys!

The did a great job.
We haven't seen any weeds for months!
Definitely worth the money I paid.
They were on time and very professional.

These guys are fantastic.
I've been using them for about three years now.
When I was first searching everyone seemed so high priced and then I found these guys the rate was nearly half of what other companies wanted to charge me.
I gave them a shot and i've always been satisfied with the companies work.
6 month guarantee, kills the weeds every time and I don't see them for another 6-7 months.
