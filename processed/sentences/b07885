I finally got to try this place out.
Rand had told me about it but you can't really know until you try for yourself.
The help was friendly and so on.... when it comes to fast food two things decide 4 me Food vs. Price.
The Burger I got was Juicy and wonderful I ordered a combo and it was like $8 and change.
Not much else to report folks.

Great Burgers always fresh and delicious also the Onion Rings are good too

Wow a burger  What service 1st time I dined inside  Staff and management were superb  I was in awe  I don't even know what I ate They really cheered up my mood and day Thanks WAB!
