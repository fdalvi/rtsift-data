I didn't even think it was possible to like a dentist, but this office changed my mind.
I used to be nervous about making dental appointments, but now I gladly go every 6 months.
I was referred to them by my brother a few years ago and now me and my teeth are happy.
They have a friendly and professional staff in a clean office.
I'm surprised no one else has reviewed them yet!

I used to go to this dentist up until about 2 years ago.
No one likes going to the dentist but I absolutely loved this place.
The only reason I switched was because this dentist is located 40 minutes from my house and my new one is only 5 minutes away.
But I definitely like this place better.
The staff is very friendly and all the hygienists do an excellent job.
Dr. Sperbeck is also very nice and gentle.
It's also very kid friendly and has a T.V with video games in the lobby and a prize machine that kids can use with the special tokens they get after their visit.
I definitely recommend this place if you live in the area!

This is a great dental office!
I used to see a dentist who was a drill first, ask questions later kinda guy.
Dr. Sperbeck is a conservative dentist.
What I mean by that is he watches questionable areas on your teeth before taking action.
He only suggests fillings if he sees growth over time.
The hygienists are great at what they do.
If you are looking to change dentists or if you are new in the area, come see Dr. Sperbeck.
Your teeth will thank you.
