So I had to return a box via FedEx but I had duct taped it because I did not have packing tape at home.
The owner/employee(?
) could have cared less and let me ship out my box as is but instead she retaped it with packaging tape.
How nice of her!
She said that I wasn't suppose to send boxes with duct tape and that FedEx probably wouldn't have retaped it for me.
I really appreciate good businesses like these and appreciate the tip!

Very nice people.
Great service.
To the owner, never sell this business, ever!
