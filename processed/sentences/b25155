I went to JL Nails on the recommendation of a neighbor.
On my initial visit I went in for a mani-pedi, my treat to myself for Mother's Day.
The staff was (is) extremely friendly but the place is a mess.
The pedicure was better than I've had in a while and my nails looked pretty.
I went in today to get my eyebrows waxed because it's closer than the salon I usually go to and I was in a bit of a hurry.
When I went to lay down the towel covering the headrest was dirty and had hair on it.
Then,  when she handed me the mirror to check out my brows I couldn't see through the grime.
I was really disappointed.
I don't need a place to have a ritzy salon atmosphere but it does need to be clean.
It's too bad, I would have loved to have a salon this close to my house.

Nancy did my nails and she did a great job.
I got a full set and a pedi.
I got lots of compliments.
I like this place and you can get a pretty good haircut next door for a good price.

If you have the manager do your nails, you will love them.
ANYONE else and you will get a horrible job and an attitude.
The last time I went there my nails had problems within a day and when I tried to talk to the technician about it she blew me off and walked away.
I was extra mad because I had been so worried about hurting her feelings when I first walked in to talk to her about it, and she was so rude despite me being super nice about my nails looking like crap within a day of getting them done.
Haven't been back since then.

Came here to get a wax and noticed that she did not use a new wooden stick on my face.
Yuck.
Won't be back.
Must be clean above all else
