Great service..
Friendly staff!!!

Friendly staff.
Great prices, tons of bargains.
Clean, bight store.
I always kick myself for going to the regular mall store when I know that the prices are so much better here!

I had really great customer service here.
I had a wallflower plug in that stopped working after 3 months and they exchanged it and were really great about it.
There are always great sales and coupons and good deals on all the products.
I mostly use their hand soap and their wallflower plug ins.
These are good products at decent prices and the people are usually very helpful.
If they are out of a certain fragrance on the shelves they are always really good about going in the back and checking for more for you as well.

We'll that do I have to say... Once you walk in you get hounded by the workers., 1st when you walk in then like 3 in the middle of the store then like 3 cashiers in  the back .
Like I know customers is good but they take it to the next level, when I get attacked by the workers I just want to tell them to leave me alone , when I go shopping In there I have my head phone on and volume up so they won't bug me I have walked out a few time and just bought what I need online just to stay away from the pushy workers ,
