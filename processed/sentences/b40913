Went to Fusion Nails on Power Road yesterday afternoon and had the best pedicure and gel manicure I have had in a long time!
Fawn (sp) was my nail technician and the leg and foot massage was superb and the nail polish application professional and lovely.
And then she outdid herself on the hand massage and wonderful application of the gel polish on my hands.
Highly recommend this studio and Fawn in particular!!!

I convinced my husband to go with me to get a mani/pedi and I was glad I did.
Best mani/pedi I have ever had.
Highly recommend the #2.
I used to go to Bella but this is my new go to spot.
Great customer service.

Customer service is their number 1 priority.
They always do such a great job as well!
