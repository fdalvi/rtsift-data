Free vacuums, very affordable prices for a self service car wash and very clean.
If you are in a budget this is the place to go and have your car shinning.
They offer a monthly and year pass for a flat fee unlimited washes or a single $5 for one time wash.
I really like it.
The only bad thing about it its the rail in the car wash that's why i did not gave them the full 5 star rating.

Nice and clean car wash. Prices are in one of the photos.
Free self serve vacuum.
Prices are good and you save water!

But Please folk, pull your pants up and turn your flippin radio down, we all don't share your tastes in music or underwear!

Very friendly and helpful staff!
Clean and affordable!
I recently purchased their monthly membership and I love it!

This is a family owned and operated business which is supervised and staffed by people who care.
Affordable and convenient!
