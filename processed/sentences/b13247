The sandwiches are to die for, the prices are great and the staff are super friendly.
From pastrami to corned beef to prime rib sandwiches and tasty wraps, to fresh salads and healthy smoothies, to mouth-watering cheesecake and other delectable desserts, you'll want to keep coming back to try something new.
They only use the best ingredients between their freshly baked breads.
You can choose from Ciabatta, Pumpernickel, Italian, Sourdough, white, wheat and many more.

One of my favorie lunch spots of all time.
I do go to their new Gibson location, but this one is just as good, albeit not as new.
I love their vegetarian selections--especially their lox sandwich.
Everything is fresh and delicious.
I've never had a better or more unique sandwich.
Prices are reasonable, service is great and atmosphere is as good as it gets for a lunch sandwich shop.
I love this place.

My buddy, originally from Brooklyn (and Jewish, so he knows his delis), warned me that this place was worthless.
I, against better judgement, decided to try it anyway.
The breads were done really well and the snacks were good (which is the only reason it got two stars), but the food itself sucked llama balls.
I barely finished my sandwich and threw out most of it.
If I wanted to eat kraft singles, I'd buy it at the supermarket.
In the only way they could understand (since they are so "brooklyn"), FUCK YOU HEIDI AND YOUR FUCKING LOUSY WANNA-BE BROOKLYN DELI.

we've only been to the new location on gibson near american pacific.
i loved it, nush said it was "really good.
"  their bread is made fresh and tastes delicious.
so far the top favorites are the: crab-cake & the prime rib sandwich .

I have spent alot of time in Brooklyn and deli food is a staple of my diet.
I can make a home-made sandwich that can compete with the best of them.
Now based on a Las Vegas market (which when it comes to certain foods, lacking is the word that comes to mind) Delis are few and far between.
At this time any deli out in these parts is a novelty.
Other options include making a sandwich at home.
Now this defeats the purpose of a deli-To have a delicious sandwich on the go with all the sides and trimmings with no prep or clean up.
H.B.D as far as local food of this genre has the competition beat.
Of coarse the comp is the likes of Subway, Quiznos, port o' shit, and Jason's deli.
All in all these are franchise delis and will never give you the real mom and pop, nitty gritty New York Deli style food much in demand world wide.
I have eaten four different sandwiches at H.B.D (pastromi, cornedbeef, turkey club, sausage and peppers)all which satisfied my deli sandwich craving to 80%.
It is just missing the authenticity.
Even though they make one tastey marble rye I miss the old faithful kaiser roll and footlong italian bread which is signiture in NY.
PRICES- fair 7-10$ CHIPS-No selection and they use the small bags with only 8chips ??!!
PORTION-I was left a bit hungry for my buck SIDES-Not many to choose and again tiny.
I found the salads/slaw bland.
SERVICE-very friendly, yet they botched one of my two sandwiches.
ATMOSHERE-open plan, no vibe, uninviting, clean, benches.
MEAT-Seemed low quality, I have had some boarshead better.
The one on Eastern never has anyone there, I hope they don't go out of buisness because I will have no place better to get my cornbeef on Rye which does not say much.
H.B.D wins by default.

Please take the name Brooklyn from your name.
I find this a disgrace to Brooklyn.
This is not a real deli.
Not by my NY standards.
My coleslaw tasted like fish.
My Reuben was soggy.
It was not real rye bread.
My boyfriends salad was warm.
He could not eat it.
And too pricey for this kind of food.
I will not be heading back.

Order the Hell's Kitchen Sandwich....simply scrumptious!
I can't have anything else!

Okay so maybe it's not authentic Brooklyn blah blah blah, it's a chain store, located in LAS VEGAS...Would you go to Jack in the Box for real sour dough bread?
Who cares (obviously all the disgruntled yelpers below)?
I like the food here and I'll come back.
The service at this location is good.
I'm always blown away when staff make eye contact and enunciate.
I was blown away!
Oh and my order wasn't all jacked up either, that indicates that they were actually listening.
How nice!

I do not know what an authentic Brooklyn deli is like but this place has some good fresh food and nice employee's.
I always get the Country Dijon egg salad and I am never disappointed.
I have had others, the turkey and a salad which both tasted great.
I have never had a complaint about the food, every time the it tastes great.
The price is higher than Subway or Port-o-subs, but I can get my egg salad for less than $7 and I think it's great!
The do enjoy eating there because its quiet and relaxing.
This place I visit at least once a week!

I like this place.
I've only been here twice - both at lunch time - but I've been impressed both times.
They have a $5 lunch special that you just can't beat.
For said $5, you get half a sandwich, a small side (coleslaw/potato salad/mac salad), a pickle, a cookie, and a "medium" drink that's pretty damn big.
Both times, I ordered the Pastrami sandwich on marble rye bread.
Their pastrami has just the right amount of fat to make it delicious.
One day, I'll probably try something else on their menu.
Or maybe I'll just end up ordering the same $5 special all the time.
Why mess with a good thing?

I had a pretty decent sized piece of metal in my coleslaw that I bit into and I'm still giving this place 4 stars...
In their defense, they said they don't make their own coleslaw (which is probably why its not that good in the first place), so the metal shaving wasn't their fault necessarily...  Anyways, awesome sandwiches, cool guys that work there, and that $5 lunch special with the delicious home made chocolate chip cookie will keep me coming back for more.
Just no more coleslaw...

The Hells Kitchen Egg Salad sandwich is probably the best I've ever had.
Gotta try this again... and I'm not even a big sandwich fan.

Very good!
Get the cajun turkey!

chicken salad sandwich was awesome.
great little place!

Here's the thing, the food is actually pretty good.
I'm not from Brooklyn or anything but the sandwiches I've eaten there are certainly tasty.
My biggest tip to you is be aware that as of late, any addition or change to your sandwich costs you extra.
Prices of ingredients go up and that's fine... but don't start adding those ingredient and THEN tell me it's going to be extra.
There's a lady there who consistently starts adding cheese or will scoop a big helping of avocado on your sandwich and then say "Oh, that's going to be $1.50 extra, is that ok?
"  As long as you're aware... good food.

I've gone here for lunch a few times, since it's close to my office.
The food is decent, not really a Brooklyn Deli, but good sandwiches.
This week I went again, and the level of service was horrible.
The line when I arrived was around 15 people.
Half the staff was not servicing the line, and a couple others appeared to be just wondering around, not doing anything.
When I finally got to the counter after 15 minutes of waiting,  instead of them making my sandwich, a different employee started arguing with them about how they had screwed up previous orders.
So they argued about this for a while before one of them stoppe makingthe sandwich he was making to remake others, all while the counter was full of people waiting to eat.
When I finally got my sandwich I had to wait in another large line to pay.
They had one person working the cash register, and he was clearly overwhealmed and confused.
They did not have anyone try to come help him.
I was finally able to pay and get my lunch, in all it took 30 minutes to get a sandwich made.
I emailed the manager to let him know about the experience, he made some excuses, didn't seem to care about his employees taking a half hour to make a sandwich.
I think there used to be a different manager there who always worked the register, and things ran smoothly, but the last couple times he has not been there.

Started working in the area and came across Heidi's by accident...
I've tried the Reuben and the Hell's Kitchen, which is an AMAZING egg salad sandwich.
Been there 4 times in the past 2 weeks.
Good stuff!!
Little disappointed on the size of the sandwiches when you get them to go.
Seems like you get more when you eat there.

Not much to say about this place other than it was clean, service was okay, and the sandwiches are good... but really... what more do you want from a deli?

Place is perfect.
Soup and sandwiches.
Try the hells kitchen egg sandwich.
Packed with flavor and great price for the combo.
Love it

Sandwich lovers, prepare to feast.
This joint has plenty to choose from in that department, and even throws in a few salads, hot dogs and soups to enjoy too.
I think the sandwiches here are good, but I think what keeps the crowds coming back are the lunch specials.
Half a sandwich, a side and a drink for $5 is tough to beat.
Even a whole sandwich at $6.99 is fair.
There are all kinds of other combos too, salad and soup, soup and sandwich, it goes on and on.
The sandwiches are a good size, even the half would be mistaken for a whole by most people.
I've enjoyed the mozzarella and tomato, a few of the turkey options and the BLT with avocado.
All tasty but what really impressed me on my last visit was the Italian bread.
It was still warm!!!
Major points.
Their wheat and such is fine, but this was the best way to have a sandwich I think.
So glad I blurted out Italian.
That's the other thing with this place...cut the small talk in line and start reading because when it's your turn to order you better be ready.
It's an assembly line of efficiency and I am almost always caught off guard and stumble through my order.
I'm from NY and this is still no NY deli, but they're trying and it works for me.

Dear Heidi, good stuff!
If you were an actual chick I would marry you.
I order from this place fairly often.
Pretty sad, the dude that answers knows my voice.
I'm obsessed with their Hell's Kitchen sandwich.
Instead of spending 3 1/2 hours making an egg salad sandwich, like Andy from 40 yo virgin, I hit this spot up.
My friend Phoogie said it best, "It has to be official!
I mean, Tom from Myspace, Yelped  about it".
On occasion, they will decide what you SHOULD get in your sandwich rather than what you ordered (there's a running joke at work about it).
I'm not trippin', because their sandwiches are that good.
If you order in, you will not have that problem.

This is one of my favorite places to go for lunch as i work pretty close.
My go to is a chicken salad wrap with sprouts.
It is a great chicken salad.And it costs about 7 dollars.There soups are good too.

I wish I had read some of the reviews from my Yelp friends because in retrospect they give good advice.
I was baffled at why my sandwich went up in price, if I read Ryan S.'s review I would have known my cheese was extra.
I was looking everywhere to see if they had a lunch special, if I read Paolo D.'s review I would have known about the half sandwich, side, pickle, cookie and drink deal for $5.
The moral of the story is that literacy is important and the corn beef is tasty.
I got the fore mentioned meat on pumpernickel with coleslaw, pepperjack, mustard, tomatoes, onions,and mustard.
Heated and toasted is the way to go.
The corn beef is moist without an ounce of fat connected to it.
Surprised, but delighted.
The bread are baked fresh and they definitely taste like it.
All sandwiches comes with a side of coleslaw, potato, or macaroni salad and a pickle spear.
For $8.09, my sandwich was delicious and filling.
They move quick and it is easy to get lost in the shuffle.
Be ready and get there a little before noon because the line gets long.

**Summary**        - Quality - One thing I love about Heidi's is their quality.
They bake their bread right there and have a wide selection.
Their meats are fresh and delicious.
- Portion - The other thing about Heidi's sandwiches is that they're big.
Thick slices of bread, Large helpings of meat.
- Price - Most sandwiches are around $8.
All sandwiches come with a small side.
There's also a deal during lunch for half a sandwich, chips, and a drink for $5.
**Favorites**        - Transplanted New Yorker - Sinfully fatty deli meats with avocado and their signature secret cajun sauce.
Every bite is deliciously salty and spicy.
- Bronx Bomber - Pastrami and egg salad.
I usually add their cajun sauce to this to seal the deal.
If you like pastrami and egg salad, you have to get this.
Be warned however, this is a pretty large sandwich and you are in danger of a food coma after wards.
**Recommendations**        - I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a quality sandwich.

Tried it twice, and I think's it nice.
Honestly, Heidi's is pretty awesome.
If you're ready through the reviews, you have probably heard that they make their own bread.
All sorts of varieties which fills the air with fabulous scents.
It really has a NY feel to it.
The furniture and they layout.. you really feel like you're in the City until you look at the window and see actual trees.
The food:  I have been twice and have ordered the fabulous, well-priced lunch special ($5).
I think both times I've gotten the Cajun Turkey with Avocado on wheat.
The sandwich is awesome, but super spicy.
Great flavor though.
I'd recommend it.
The macaroni salad is really good as well, but you only get about three bites.
If you're hungry, opt for chips.
The first time I went the line was ridiculous, but it was definitely worth the wait.
Today wasn't so bad, and it's Friday.
Maybe go slightly before noon?
Five bucks for an appetizer (pickle), meal (chips/sandwich) and dessert cookie.
Can't beat it!

''Hell's Kitchen'' Avocado (bomb) Bacon (bomb) Swiss Cheese (bomb) Egg salad w/ mayo & honey pepper (bomb) on either Pumpernickle or Rye.
BOMB.

I got dragged here for lunch with friends and it was NOT a good experience.
The place was a zoo, parking was atrocious, the soft drinks and cooler fruit juices and such were overpriced (even by Vegas standards), and good luck finding a seat.
But when I got to the counter and had 3 orders screwed up because the staff couldn't listen to me I have a problem with that.
When I asked them to fix their mistake and had to repeat myself 4 times, and then got an attitude back on top of that?
Oh no!
I won't be back.
I don't do cattle call lunches where you mooove 'em in and mooove 'em back out the door.
Do yourself a favor, find somewhere else to eat.
The ONLY thing saving them from a place on my Absolutely Not list is that the food once they finally figured things out was edible.
Boring, uninspired, blah, but edible.

the best lunch special around.
For $5 bucks you get a killer sandwich, drink, side, and a cookie.
I go here a couple time a week.

I drive by this place all the time but due to its generic exterior, I have not considered trying it until a friend recommended it to me.
Overall, the service was lacking, what I purchased was overpriced, but the food was good enough to make up for the two other areas and I will definitely return.
The flow of how and where they expect you to order is just confusing.
You have to walk through a row of tables or walk against the flow of customers ordering to get to the spot where they want you to order.
Once you get there, there is an awkward pillar right in front of the main menu.
I found myself hovering to each side of the pillar looking at different parts of the menu.
On top of all that, the sandwich makers stare you down until you start to order.
I felt pressured to decide what I wanted immediately.
I had very little time to ponder over my decision.
Once you order, the flow of what to do next is uncertain for new customers.
I walked across the counter to the register only to find out that the sandwich maker would hand me my sandwich back where I originally ordered.
Then, I committed the sin of asking for baked chips and I was forced to walk across the store to pick those up.
Oh and FYI they charge 69 cents extra for any chips that aren't original Lays.
Once I got to the register the cashier did not offer me a small size drink.
She showed me the medium and said, "this size is okay right?
" I found that to be a little sketchy.
Finally she was ready to ring up my order when another employee came up and started talking to the cashier about her schedule.
The cashier didn't even say anything to me, stopped helping me, and talked to the other employee for about a minute.
Eventually my order was rung up and I was able to sit down and eat.
Before I review the food itself, I want to briefly talk about the value of the food.
I paid for both my girlfriend's and my meals.
We each got a full sized sandwich, medium drink, and a side.
The order totaled around $18.
I feel that Heidi's is asking a little too much money for what you get.
To be fair, they do offer a $5 special that includes a half sandwich, side, small drink, and a cookie.
I wish there were other ways to upgrade to a meal without downgrading my drink, sandwich and being required to have a cookie.
So basically if you want to buy into the only real good value in the store, you have to compromise in what you are getting.
Flow, service, and value aside, the food was amazing.
I ordered the Fresh Mozzarella Sandwich on (thick cut) wheat bread.
The sandwich included mozzarella, tomato, balsamic vinegar, lettuce, onion, and a mouth watering pesto sauce.
The sandwich reminded me of how some people act with crack, I just couldn't get enough.
Even after I left the store, I kept wanting to go back and get another one.
My girlfriend got the Chicken Salad Sandwich on wheat bread.
Her's was equally delicious.
I can't wait to go back and try something new.
I gave Heidi's 4 stars despite the negatives I described in this review.
I was really judging them during the ordering process, but once I sat down and bit in to my sandwich I was hooked.
I believe if a restaurant has some flaws, the food can sometimes keep you coming back.
That is definitely the case with Heidi's.

I work in the same business park as this joint....  Its seems to be quite popular being crowded at lunch.
I ordered the pastrami reuben.
It was 6.99 comes with a side and dill pickle.
The bread is freshly made daily on site.
The sandwich was decent, nothing to come onto yelp and rave about...
It was a nice sized sandwich, I wouldnt say over stuffed but filling.
In conclusion, this place is ok, not great, but is there really a great deli in Vegas...
Location makes it easy for me to grab a lunch and will try other things...
I would be mainly for convience not for the great taste...
I would tell friends to try it, perhaps they will find it to be better than me.
Hope this YELPS....   7/14/12 I tried the tuna,, it was okay, the portion wasn't that big.
I am sure many of us could make a better tuna salad than these folks..
The bread being fresh is very good.
I paid 6.99 for a tuna on white, includes a bag of chips or a mouthful of some salad... My recommendation,, buy some albacore mix it up yourself...
Skip the tuna at this place or go go the subway, it tastes the same... Hope this yelps

Since it's just become typical everywhere here in the valley, I quit complaining about prices here in town yrs ago- but if I hadn't.....  this is a very ordinary place selling pretty much very ordinary food.
Their cajun turkey's probably the exception, it stands out.

I try really hard to be patient and polite when food places fu@!
up my order to avoid a juicy loogie in my sandwich or my bun being used to mop the floor.
But how is it possible for a sandwich shop to make sandwiches wrong EVERY TIME?
Why give people the option of  mayo or mustard, choice of bread, lettuce, tomato, onions, sprouts, choice of cheese when they dont give you what you ask for.
Is it only when they feel like it?
After the 5th or 6th time of screwing up, my anger turned into a humorous game.
Kind of like those HIGHLIGHT books you had as a kid.
The "WHATS MISSING?
" game.
A picture of a horse with no leg or bicycle with no tires.
Thats what comes to mind when I hear someone mention " Heidi's Deli"   I ordered the usual turkey sandwich on rye bread and got a tuna fish sandwich.
At least they got the mayo right even though its mixed in with the tuna.
I  personally went to heidi's to see what idiot makes my sandwich.
Just curious... Maybe if I personally go up there, its a lesser chance to fu@* up my sandwich.
A polite woman with somewhat broken english takes my order.
She already starts off wrong by giving me the wrong bread.
She apologizes and asks me "what kind of bread was it again?
" Rrrrrrrrggghhh...
While making my sandwich, a police man comes in and she starts making small talk.
Shouldnt you be focusing on making my sandwich?
I couldnt see everything she was doing because the counter is so high.
In the end, after driving to the park with my sandwich in my hand, no cheese, no pickle and no onions.
No offense, but Heidi must be blonde.

Great vegetarian options.
We beat the lunch rush by about 10 minutes so we didn't have any issues with service or wait times.
I love that the lunch special comes with a little cookie and you can't beat two adult meals and a kids meal for under $20.
Yay!

5 stars for their lunch special consisting of my favorite sandwich: Hell's Kitchen and their awesome chocolate chip cookie.
Their Hell's Kitchen sandwich comes with egg salad, avocado,and bacon!
So good it haunts me on a weekly basis.
Their chocolate chip cookie is once of the best I've ever had!
Come for the lunch special; good price and perfect sized portion!

I work close to this place and me and my co-workers go here for lunch.
Besides being convenient it is very tasty and a good product, there is a Subway nearby also but I would not even bother with that crap compared to Heidi's, I rather spend an extra buck or two and really like what I am eating.
Sometimes service is a little slow depending, if you go during lunch time you might have a good wait but otherwise it is not bad at all.
I have ate there probably a dozen or more times and it was great every time.

More like 2.5, but again, Yelp won't let you give half stars...and I can't round up on these guys.
First and foremost, I'm just gonna be blunt here, do not call yourself a deli...you aren't a deli.
I'll be OK with sandwich shop, but you are most certainly not a deli.
Giving a pickle with your sandwich does not make you a deli.
And, while we're at it, take Brooklyn out of your name, too...there is absolutely nothing Brooklyn about you.
As for what killed this place for me...the excessive microwaving and re-heating of everything.
That's not called cooking, that's called preparing...and I can do that at home.
Having said all of that, the food was OK.
Nothing special...nothing inoffensive.
The meatballs (frozen) were tasty...the marinara (canned) was tasty...my daughter's Nathan's Hot Dog was as it should be, if not a bit too nuked, along with the microwaved bun.
The roastbeef on the beef dip was ok but the nuking was excessive.
I won't be going back and will not recommend to anyone I know...not because it is awful...just unnecessary...and ill-named.

This is the best off the strip sandwich spot period.
I've been here many times on my lunch break and the line is always long after noon, for obvious reasons.
Delicious sandwiches, fresh ingredients and fresh cooked bread.
All sandwiches come with your choice of  FRESH daily in house cooked bread which includes the following: Ciabatta, Butter-Top White, Light-Rye, Pumpernickel, Marble-Rye, Sour Dough, Whole Wheat, French Hoagie, Italian Hoagie.
They have an awesome lunch special, for $5, you get half a sandwich, a small side with your choice of Coleslaw or Potato Salad, a cookie and a drink.
I usually order the Heidi's club on Whole wheat with Turkey & Bacon with Avacado, Sprouts, Lettuce, Mayo & Onions....Always fresh ingredients.
**Favorite Sandwiches: Egg Salad & Heidi's Club on Whole Wheat with Turkey & Bacon.
**Sides: Coleslaw (And I'm not a fan of coleslaw, but their coleslaw is pretty damn good!).
Potato Salad (LOVE IT)   **Oh yea, Heidi's has great vegetarian options as well, all of their Vegetarian choices have a Green Star in front of them :)   5 STARS all around

Love this sandwhich place!
The bread is fresh and so are the deli and the veggies.
I usually order the turkey special, which for $7 comes with a drink and a choice of side, chips or potatoe salad, or maccaroni salad.
I usually just get the chips, because the other stuff were too small.
But all still a great deal!
Staff is great always service with a smile.
This is on my top lunch list!

Awesome!
Went there, the knew how to say Italian words the right way and not Americanized.
Brought home a corned beef sandwich, and the break was still soft and delicious not hard as a rock like others places I've brought a sandwich home from.
Just the right amount of spicy mustard.
So good.
Highly recommended.
Delicious

I do wish I could rate half stars or something.
I would probably go with a 3.5 on this place, but I decided to round up in this case because I really only have one complaint.
The food I ordered was very good.
They advertise a lot about their fresh baked daily bread, and it truly was really really good bread.
I ordered an Italian sub type sandwich on a hoagie roll and it was pretty darn good.
They made it fresh right in front of me.
It had a good portion of meats, sauce etc.
My only complaint at all was that I do think the place is a bit pricey for what they are offering.
Although the portions were good, I still spent $11.46 on a sandwich, chips, and a drink.
We know we can get cheaper lesser quality other places, so it really depends on you.
If you think a little extra quality, and better taste is worth that much more money, then this is a great place.
I personally don't mind spending a little extra for better food, but I won't do it often because it gets spendy.

Cheap, Fresh, and Fast!!
I come here for my lunch sometimes and they do not let me down...the sandwiches are made right before your eyes and the bread is literally sliced to order!
they have many different types to order from or you can create your own.

The team members were pleasant.
My 13 yr old son swears that the Hells Kitchen on marbled rye is THEE greatest sandwich he will ever eat!
The Cajun sauce is a little much for me, but the Cajun Turkey with avocado is delicious.
My husband always gets the Italian and eats the whole thing!!!
I don't recommend any of the soups, they are never hot enough, even after they warm them up.

Great lunch specials!
Good food and friendly staff!
Give them a try.
I had tuna salad with coleslaw and a pickle, I will return.
Everything was very good.
Place is clean too.

Its expensive for bread and meat.

$8.00 for a small, Deli-Sandwich and a tablespoon of Potato Salad.
Quality is good but portion size for price is not.
Location is everything here and probably the only reason for the revenue to stay in operation.

I have to say that based on some of the other reviews, I think I went at the right time of day and they did get my order right, yeaaa!
I ordered the corned beef sandwich on marble rye bread and it was pretty decent,  I must say.
I enjoyed it.
I DO HAVE TO SAY THOUGH, that my bread was thicker and meatier than the corned beef between it.
I guess they wanted me to have plenty of room to taste the bread by itself without any meat getting in the way.
And I ASSURE YOU, the meat stayed clear the hell out of the way.
Each slice of bread was 1 inch thick, so I was literally eating through 2 inches of bread, seriously (I actually pulled my ruler out of my desk and measured it, I know it sounds anal :( but I'm just saying))..
I'm still hungry, that's what I'm saying.
All in all, the sandwich was good and so far it is the best I have found here in LV, but I am still searching.
Nothing like the corned beef from Lou's Deli in Detroit, MI, but still good and I will return when I am not as hungry as I was today.
Maybe next time I will ask for some butter so I can appropiately say I had half a sandwich and a thick slice of bread and butter for my meal.

Delicious and $5 dollar special is great!
I like all of their sandwiches :-) My favorite is Cajun Turkey.

Turkey bacon avocado- its a must!

Went here with a buddy who loves it, mostly because of their $5 lunch special (which was actually $5.99 and therefore 6 bucks in my book, but still reasonable enough.
) For that meager sum, you get 1/2 a sandwich, drink, cookie, and a choice of chips or side salad.
The sandwich is generous, and on the plus side they slice the bread right from the loaf as you order.
I chose rye because I like it, but for the future,  clearly the correct strategy would be to eyeball which loaf is about half gone so you will get the maximum slice out of the middle.
Yes, I am a pig.
She got the Hell's Kitchen, which involved egg salad, Swiss cheese, bacon, and hot sauce.
Surprisingly good combo of richness, smokiness, and a little heat.
Thumbs up.
I tried the chicken salad, and it was just how I like it.
Chunks of chicken, a little sweetness, and no hard things to ruin the whole experience.
For my side, I got the chips since they came in a bag and were a normal serving.
Side salads were dished out in those tiny little plastic cups one associates with ketchup or tartar sauce, not cole slaw.
WTF?
Good thing I observed this in time to order accordingly.
I suggest you do the same.
And I agree this is misnamed as a deli.
Definitely a sandwich shop.

So one day we're waiting on a prescription and absolutely ravenous.
We avoided all of the chains and stumbled on Heidi's while turning around in their parking lot.
The place was VERY clean.
The owners(?
) were there, and very friendly.
My husband got a BLT and it was pretty good.
I got the 'Awesome Salad' and it was anything but awesome.
Chopped iceburg, DICED tomatoes, slices of mozzarella and what has GOT to be pre-packed quacamole (it tasted like rotten eggs) - all jammed into a clear plastic to-go container.
I've never been so angry about a salad.

Get there early during lunchtime.
wish they had a wider selection of sides r even chips .
but on several occasions ive enjoyed the philly sandwich and some others have enjoyed masterpieces such as a chicken parmesan sandwich & the hells kitchen

I'm seriously obsessed with this place.
Whenever I come to Vegas I make my friends go with me like 5 times.
The chicken salad is the best ever.
And I saw someone say that she was upset that her bread was so thick but they slice each piece as they need it and there's a sign that says to ask for your bread sliced thin so if that's what you're about, just ask them.

Visited Heidi's for the first time yesterday with my co-worker during lunch break.
I'm not really a sandwich person but she wanted to try it so I agreed.
I choose the ham and cheese club sandwich and it was pretty good, big sandwich, lots of meat.
The only downside was the avocado was more of a spread and I wasn't a fan of that.
I will probably be back to try something else as they have plenty of variety.
