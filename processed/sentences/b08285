My two dogs, Willis and Dudely comes and gets a haircut on this Pet Gromming Salon and they did a great job.

Horrible customer service!
Store very unclean, something I over looked for a few visits, but when customer service went south, that was it!
AND my poor dog never got a drink of water hen he was there!
Never again!

*BEWARE* I have had my dogs groomed at Smoochie Poochie multiple times, not because the haircuts are the best, but because I was going the economical route.
Never again will I risk my pets' health to save a buck!
The last two grooming sessions have left my dog injured.
The first injury occurred on a hind leg, where the fur was cut so closely and the razor burn was so intense that he now has a large bald patch.
The most recent injury occurred last week, when my dog was sent home with a large wound on his neck.
It appeared as though some sort of coagulant was applied to stop bleeding and a bandana was placed around his neck.
I was not informed of the injury when I picked him up and the establishment denied any wrongdoing when questioned about it later.
After an urgent trip to the vet, my poor dog is left with a two inch gash on his neck, round-the-clock pain medicine, and a course of antibiotics.
The vet stated that this was absolutely the result of grooming trauma and urged me to find a new groomer.
I realize that accidents happen and that dogs are wiggly, but this is unacceptable.
I am appalled that Smoochie Poochie didn't alert me to the injury, denies any wrongdoing, and refuses to apologize.
Save your dog from harm and injury and save yourself from the heartache you'll feel when they maim your dog, too.

Unclean environment.
We brought our dog in for grooming with specific instructions on how we wanted her groomed the first time they followed our request the next time we barely recognized her she was shaved almost to the skin.....never again will we use Smoochie Poochie....
