You know what happens when your 30+ boyfriend forgets that he isn't 6yrs old anymore and figures that there is no harm in jumping on the bed?
You find yourself walking around countless bed stores looking for a new bed.
Archers stood out for one thing and one thing only - no pushy salesmen.
We were able to bounce around all the mattresses we wanted to in peace without anyone following us around.
Signficant enough reason to buy the mattress we liked from here as well as the bed.
Extremely reasonable prices in comparison to other bed stores in the area.

Walked in and there was a group of salesmen just standing around chatting.
No acknowledgement or anything.. We wandered around for quite a while before someone came up to offer help.
They seem to have quite a large range of beds.
although their range of spring'less mattresses wasn't great.
Their prices seemed quite low.
Being a firm believer in "you get what you pay for" when it comes to mattresses, we decided to pass on their options and go elsewhere.
But if you're looking for something cheap and cheerful rather than an investment, then Archers is well worth a look-see.
Just don't expect timely, attentive service.
To his credit the guy was friendly enough when he eventually came over.
