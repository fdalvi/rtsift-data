Theologian Michael Horton in Pilgrim Theology writes, "I do not believe the gospel because I believe in God; rather, I believe in God because of the gospel.
There are great arguments for the existence of a supreme being, but unless the gospel is true, the claim that a god exists is either personally meaningless or a horrible threat.
"  I have been blessed by the preaching of Spring Meadows PCA because of its high regard for preaching the Gospel.
We don't outgrow it, our joy should never move beyond it, and I believe it vital to make sure the preaching you sit under provides a  healthy portion of it in every sermon.
If you yearn for gospel centered preaching, I recommend Spring Meadows PCA church to you.

I've been attending Spring Meadows for several years now and I am consistently blessed by the gospel-centered preaching and teaching, the commitment to truth as it is found in Scripture, and a community that works to live out the implications of the gospel in our daily lives.
