I've been to this Applebee's about five or six times over the last 3 years.
The menu is, of course, classic Applebee's, something for everyone.
But I found the service to be listless.
When I entered the restaurant the last time, the two hostesses were sitting down; they lifted their eyes to see me, and then reluctantly brought their bodies upright.
One of them greeted me without a smile, and slowly showed me to my seat.
The waiter who took my order only said about two words, and I was supposed to guess what my role was at that moment in the non-conversation.
Zombies have taken over this restaurant.
It's more "Shaun of the Dead" than "My Dinner with Andre.

Maybe it's because we were frequent visitors, but I've always pretty good service here.
Between our trips to the bar, for sit down food, and take out food - it could make sence that they knew who we were.
I worked right in that area and we enjoyed that we could just walk over there for lunch.
It also served as a great after work spot that everyone could agree on.
I know, I know, chains are evil... but there is a lot to be said for a spot that you can take a vegetarian, a burger and beer girl, a Martini girl, a "get the party started pre-strip club" kind of guy, a few sports nuts who'll go anywhere as long as the game is on, and some folks who just want food - and they can all find something they like.
Finally - when we said "hey, we're here for lunch so we have to go kinda fast" they would always hustle to get us out on time.
So is it my spot of choice, heck no.
But it's not a bad default option.

Good food Friendly service (only if they are not busy) I mainly go here for the appetizers and beer during happy hour

This is my dad's wife's favorite restaurant.
She thinks cilantro is exotic and Caesar salads are too spicy.
Applebee's isn't terrible.
The food is.. edible?
It is definitely over processed and bland, but there is at least a good variety of (tasteless) meals, and a few somewhat healthy choices.
And they are open late.
I wouldn't choose to go there, but if you gotta do a chain or entertain easily frightened Midwesterners it is OK.
This location tends to have horrendous service.
One time we had to wait at least 30 minutes with empty dishes and cups and no check.
We almost just left!

The only good thing about Applebee's is that it gives bad parents somewhere to take their bratty kids while still having a "night out" so they don't infiltrate places that I actually want to go.
One star for that.
Two stars only if you stay in the bar and stick with beer and appetizers.

It's cheap good food.
Not outstanding but you get what you pay for so you can't really complain.
And lets face it, you're not really going there for the atmosphere or some top notch dish, you just want a variety decent food at a good price.
Sure it's a chain, who cares?
Sorry to all those anti-chain people, let me guess, you're drinking microbrew right now?
Get over it you yuppie!

It's a chain, yes, but the food is decent and consistent.
I love the fact that they have healthy options and even have WW "Points" listed on certain menu items.
I got the Italian Chicken and Portobello Sandwich and after the initial laughter at my table died down about how small the portion was, I dove in and found it quite tasty.
The side of fruit left something to be desired (a few pieces of apple and 1 strawberry), but I finished the meal satisfied and feeling good about myself.
Kudos to you Applebee's, for making it a little easier to meet people for a quick lunch without having to completely sabotage my diet.
The only reason I'm not giving it more stars is the service - what can I say, it was "OK" at best.
But I'll be back for the menu options and cheap eats for sure.

Not only is the food overpriced and barely edible, the service is horrible!
For the money, if you really need a chain restaurant, head down the road to Chilli's.

I never write review for a chain restaurant before but this time I will.
I went to this Apple Bee's for a quick lunch.
As usual I love to order their sirloin steak.
The host forgot to assign a waiter to our table so we have to wait for 15 minutes until we actually got someone to our table.
But once he came, he's very polite, apologize for our waiting time and the food came in 5 minutes after we ordered.
What make me even more surprise was the manager came into each table and greet us and making sure that everything was okay and we got whatever we need.
I definitely satisfied with the service and it leave a good memories.
Thanks Apple Bee's for beyond standard service!

Nothing particularly special about this place.
Really just wanted to write this review for the following information...
Happy hour times are as follows: Monday through Friday, 3pm - 7pm and 9pm - Close.
Half off drinks AND appetizers Saturday and Sunday, 9pm - Close.
Half of drinks (no appetizers).

What can you say...
It's Applebees.
If you don't set your expectations too high you probably won't be disappointed.
The service during my visit was prompt and pleasant.
The cheeseburger sliders were good; they were no White Castle but then, nothing is.
All in all, nothing to complain about.

OK, so Applebees is Applebees.
You know what you're going to get, and you know it isn't going to be too expensive.
The late night happy hour is awesome, an appetizer, 3 beers and 2 margs is only 20 bucks before tip, you really can't go wrong with that.
All of the servers and bartenders here are really nice and I've never had any issues until last night, or else I would have given this 4 stars in comparison to other cheap mediocre restaurants.
So, last night, my girlfriend and I went in for dinner, and in her broccoli there was a huge beetle.
If I ever read about bugs in food, or other crazy things on Yelp, I usually have a hard time believing it, because I know people like to bitch and will probably make up something to make themselves feel better.
The waiter and manager handled the situation well, and comped everything and apologized more than enough, so kudos to them for that.
I'll probably be back solo for late night happy hour, but my girlfriend will never return.

I have eaten at this Applebee's many times over the last 10 years.
I think the food is very average and although I do not eat here very often.
When I do the staff is always friendly and provides assistance in regards to the menu when needed.
There happy hour is awesome and appetizers are 50% off during happy hour.
I have had there baby back ribs, chicken quesadillas,bbq chicken salad, and burgers.
The food is fresh even though it is just average American grub.

Yep, a solid 3 stars for this Applebees (which in yelp speak means A-OK)  I like the 3-7pm happy hour and the late night happy hour is good too.
The late night happy hour and trivia makes this a nice break if you want to hang out with friends, but still have a conversation which can be all but impossible at a sports bar.
Pluses: - Recently this location has been getting busier which is a good sign - Food is better than Chilis - The new campaign to serve lunch quickly has suddenly made this a practical consideration for lunch that has to fit within one hour including driving time.
- Beer is cheap in happy hour - Friendly staff  Cons: - It's an American corporate chain restaurant, so don't expect gourmet ingredients.

Not quite 3 stars but better than 2 so I'll give these guys the benefit of the doubt.
If its not happy hour it not really worth the price.
You can find  much better dishes elsewhere, even nearby, for comparable prices.
Service was OK, the server took awhile to get us our drinks and he forgot to put in our apps.
but he did apologize.
Its Applebee's nothing more, nothing less.
Predictable chain food, not great and not awful.

It's kinda my fault.
I should have yelped this location first.
But most Applebee's I've frequented have been decent.
The service was good.
But the food wasn't up to par.
My wife and I had their 2/$20 deal.
Spinach & Artichoke appetizer was so-so.
Not much flavor.
My wife had the blackened chicken & penne pasta.
She says it was "alright.
" (I made the same thing at home last week and mine was better) I had the chicken and shrimp skillet.
The shrimps were small and just warm.
they were probably cooked ahead and spooned on top later.
The chicken breast was overcooked and dry.
Served with fried red potatoes and a mushroom and onion stirfry, I hesitated to send it back fearing retaliation (if you know what I mean) on a different meal.
Now I'm totally turned off by going to another Applebee's whereever I travel.
Should have went to get burgers at Five Guys in the same parking lot.

We wanted a comfortable, non-fast food, but fast service place to eat supper and chose Applebees.
The place was crowded and the wait was 15-20 minutes.
I ordered the blackened steak medium rare.
It was delicious!
My friend ordered the blackened talaptia (fish for Lent) and said it was good.
Thanks for a nice evening out, Applebees.
We'll be back.

I love this Applebee's!
The people here are really friendly and have great service.
Jeff is my favorite waiter, he's the best!
The food is really good and the service is prompt.
I'm giving them 5 stars because they deserve it.

Don't waste your time.
The waitresses are beyond slow, and once they are done flirting with the table next to you, she might  visit your table and then disappear.

Boy, if I checked in here, it was a mistake.
I'm not even sure you could pay me to go to Applebees.

The server was over the top obnoxious.
He insisted on having our names just to take our order.
He was very friendly but it was to the point of intrusive.
He pulled up a chair and chatted AT us on three different occasions.
When I ordered my food he insisted that I order something different.
When I finally got my food it was mediocre at best.
The manager was also having a meeting with two new employees at a near by table, so we had to listen to all the Applebee's rules and regulations.
Let me tell you, there are a lot of them.
The manager's list went on and on for our entire meal  Almost, every sentence started with "I can't" or  "You can't".
The manager made me hate this place even more.

I normally don't prefer to eat at chains (though I will on occasion), but this one holds a special place for me.
I'd just driven into Phoenix on a Wednesday afternoon, after a long drive across the country.
Earlier in the day I'd signed the lease on my apartment and confirmed with the movers when they were coming the next morning.
So this tired chick hopped on Yelp to find some food -- nearby, familiar, and good enough.
I found this Applebee's not too far away and also in the same parking lot as Target (killing two birds with one stone).
It was my first meal here, since all of my belongings (read: pots, pans, cooking utensils) were on an 18-wheeler somewhere in the vast Phoenix metropolis.
The people here were friendly enough, and I like their "550" menu of dishes fewer than 550 calories.
So while I've grown fond of finding and frequenting locally-owned joints, on occasion I do hit a chain.
This one was there for a very tired chick who needed some hot food and a nearby Target!

I have gone to this Applebee's countless times and each time the food has been okay and the waiters have been mediocre.
I liked the food that they have but for the past 3 times that I have gone.
My food took ONE HOUR AND A HALF.
That was unacceptable to me!
They also didn't give a discount or even sorry for the inconvience.
I remember seeing a commerical of how the food needs to be made in 30 minutes during happy hour or it all will be free.
I guess that doesn't apply!
Its probably another scam to bring customers in.
I also didn't give the waitresses a tip each on of the times that the food was late.
My friends and I were about to leave because the food took so long to come.
I had ordered a simple spicy chicken salad and that took almost 2 hours to prepare.
Other people's foods were being made before us when they had clearly come later then us.
Probably not going to this place anymore more for late night food.

Do not eat here.
Terrible.

A week or so ago I went to this particular Applebees and left pretty upset.
I immediately went home and wrote a comment about my unhappiness and told them I would never return because of the service received that day (note that this is the first and only time I've received bad service from this location).
The next day I received a call from the GM, returned the call and couldn't reach him.
Like anyone else, I'm busy and forgot to call back another day.
Today a manager actually came to my home with flowers (!!!
) to apologize since they couldn't reach me, which shocked me to no end.
I've never, ever seen any company go to such great lengths to keep a customer.
It really impressed me, and now I will totally go back.

Applebee's is a great restaurant to eat at.
The food, drinks, and prices Are great.
But not at this location.
The service sucks.
And if you ask for a booth table they get pissy with you.
It takes forever for them to bring the drinks.
I don't like this location.
I drive further down the road just for the better service.

We visited this Applebee's location last night.
We were out running errands, it was getting late, and this location is right around the corner from the house.
The food is average for a chain.
You know what you're gonna get no matter what location you go to.
The service however is hit or miss...and last night the service missed the mark by a mile!
Our waiter got to our table and asked for our drink order.
Good deal.
We order when he returns with our drinks.
J's order - Fajitas.
My order - Oriental Chicken Salad Baby C's order - Kids Meal Grilled chicken sandwich  (Kids Eat Free on Tuesdays)  Our server, Michael,  runs off before I'm able to state..uhhh...the kids meal comes with a drink and side!!
We have to flag him down.
We state...we didn't have a chance to order the drink or side for our son.
He's like...oh i ordered him fries.
I'll have to go change it.
REALLY!?
I'm so sorry to inconvenience you!!
And I'm glad you think you know better than I do what I wanna feed MY CHILD!
Wow!
How perceptive of you...ya dumbazz!!
I order Baby C some steamed broccoli and a juice.
J's and my food come out as ordered.
Baby C's is MIA.
A few minutes later his sandwich is brought out....with an applesauce.
Again I have to flag down the server so the correction can be made.
About 5 minutes later we get a side of over steamed broccoli...but whatever.
Baby C doesn't seem to mind.
Drinks...he's on the ball with refills of my water.
But misses the mark with J's root beer refill.
He brings him Dr. Pepper instead.
And then when J says...hey this is Dr. Pepper, not Root Beer.
The server is like..you ordered Dr. Pepper though, right?
WRONG!
Then we had to wait around for the check and for him to run my card.
It was funny, but I was looking around and spotted the servers other tables.
The one right next to us didn't seem happy either with the service.
In fact they seemed pretty pissed.
I sure hope we get a different server if and when we ever return.

You literally couldn't pay me to go here ever again.
Which is sad because when I was young my Dad and I loved to go here.
However, things have changed and standards seem to be much lower.
In short, the service was slow and the food was disgusting.
The chicken was rubbery and the mashed potatoes were freezer burned...it was like eating cafeteria food only more expensive lol!
0/10 would never ever recommend.

My friends and I like to hang out, buy cheap drinks and appetizers, and have fun.
Applebees is typically our ideal location for nights we plan out, due to their awesome happy hour.
We usually go to one particular location but on occasion we will go to this one (44st and Thomas).
I've been to this location maybe 8 times.
Every single time, we leave incredibly dissatisfied.
The food is cold or tastes old.
The drinks are always watered down.
The last time we went was a few weeks ago.
My boyfriend had just got off work and wanted to have some drinks after a long day.
We decided to go to Applebees, once again, for some food and drinks.
Since this location was nearer, we decided to give it a shot.
I ordered the nachos.
Because I'm a vegetarian, I ordered it without the chili cheese sauce.
How hard is it to get nachos wrong?
My boyfriend ordered the two for $11.99 meal and got the blackened steak and chicken parmesan pasta.
To drink, I ordered a strawberry daiquiri and he ordered a Dos Equis beer.
The drinks sat at the bar for ages as we waited for the waitress to deliver it.
By the time we received them, they tasted watered down- even the beer.
Finally our food arrived.
The nachos looked great, as did his food.
However, looks can be deceiving.
Everything about the nachos was disgusting.
The cheese (queso blanco sauce) was cold, as if the nachos had been sitting around.
The chips tasted old and stale.
My boyfriend's steak was tough and very small.
And the chicken pasta was cold as well.
The waitress (I believe her name was Taylor), wasn't very attentive.
I don't blame her for the quality of the food, but the service could have been better.
When we asked for the check (after I could only manage to eat some of the nachos) my boyfriend decided to inform her about the old taste of the chips.
The waitress informed us that we needed to tell her earlier, which was understandable.
She went on to explain the old taste could have come from the fact that the fresh batch of chips were just currently being fried, so my batch was most likely older, which obviously did not sit well with me.
We paid, and even tipped decently (15%), left quietly, and vowed to never ever go there again.
We will drive out of our way to go to a different Applebees if need be.

The food is good because newer restaurant.
The salad bar is good and at a decent price.
The prices are better here,then at the airport.
If your waiting around by the airport for someone to come in from where ever.
Have eaten at the bar a couple times now and always enjoyed the service and food!

Was grocery shopping for dinner and somehow ended up here instead... Our host was very nice and sat us immediately after walking in, he also informed us on drink specials.
It is a bit loud here but not as loud as the camelback/central location :)  I was thinking of ordering a drink but opted for water instead just because.
We decided on the 2-4-24 and chose boneless wings as our appetizer.
I think Applebee's wing's are just OK compared to other places, the sauce just doesn't do it for me but I'll eat them  For my entree I decided on the double crunch shrimp with fries  Wow, they give you at least 18 pieces of shrimp and I am like trying to eat...
Unless they're trying to say something haha  I'm taking some home The shrimp is good itself with the sauce on the side

Was not impressed with my too oily & tasteless shrimp meal.
I walked out wishing I went to Chili's.

No wait for a Wednesday night which was nice and the food came out quickly.
Fish and chips were crispy on the outside and still cold on the inside.
Sandwich was ok, but nothing very impressive and definitely not worth the $9.99 price tag.
We sent back the Fish and Chips and it took a pretty long time to get the replacement meal we requested.
Not planning on returning ever again.
Service was quick, except for the replacement meal taking forever.

So sick of WAITING while tables sit empty & the "cutsie" little greeter girls act like they are working.
No idea of organization or time management.
Used to love this one but not anymore.
After waiting, kids meals came when we were done eating and they were stone cold!
The one manager is very condescending & could care less.
Could be a major reason this Applebee's is going downhill.
I'll be happy to drive to north Scottsdale or even Elliot.
They both have more responsible employees & managers that care.

We were in the mood for wings and their half price reverse happy hour.
Everyone was nice, the food was good, we shared the regular boneless wings, barbecue boneless wings, and mozzarella sticks.
However.
About a half hour, maybe an hour at most, both of us were horribly sick.
All last night, and now today too.
My girlfriend had to leave work she's so sick (I told her not to go into work with food poisoning...) It was probably the chicken wings.
At least its friday now so we can be sick at home and not worry about working.

This is a great spot to hang out with family and friends.
I mostly come for the sincere service and the crazy karaoke nights.
But I just found out last weekend there isn't anymore Karaoke by the wonderful host Stew.
They are in need of someone ASAP.
My father in law is a big fan of singing every Saturday but that won't keep us out.
It's kid friendly and even a nice girls night out.
This location does get a little busy I did notice that the soap was out and they didn't have papertowels but that just shows how popular this place is and one of the waitresses got to it right away.
I love that 2 for $20 and $24 can't believe it even includes an appetizer.
This time I treated myself to their shrimp plate and picked my favorite sides of a perfect portioned fruit bowl and a warm scoop of mashed potatoes.
I thought I'd actually get to have leftovers but I devoured the whole meal and had a little of everyone else's mouth watering meals.
Having a group of people around definitely benefits you because each meal gets better and better.
Too bad we were all too full for all their delicious desserts I'll definitely be back for that Maple Butter Blondie

I really enjoy applebees but this one did not mix my perfect margarita correctly.
I drove 20 minutes so I could have my perfect and an decent meal to receive a bitter drink not mixed to the recipe and not measured correctly.
Consistency is everything.

My two friends and I went for lunch today and the service was really bad.
There were several tables loaded with dirty dishes around us, which, when we left an hour it so later, were still the same way.
It took so long to get our food that I did not order a second portion for fear that we would have  to wait too long.
The food, when we finally got it, was tepid soup and a spinach salad without much dressing but trying to send it back was not an option.
It looked as if they were short on staff and very short on supervision.
I will not be going back for some time.
This experience was very frustrating.

We went in to get just desserts and both were delicious!
We ordered the Butter Pecan Blondie & the Triple Chocolate Meltdown.
The butter pecan dessert was served on a hot griddle which kept the cake hot the whole time & it went well with the ice-cream.
The chocolate cake was also good ..
Very chocolate-y & again that went well with the ice-cream.
The only couple of things that were off-putting were: the service - it took quite a while for someone to come around, so we figured we'd put the order in right away when we got drinks & also the table was so sticky!
It was like it wasn't even cleaned with a clean rag.
Their happy hour menu looked really appealing - half off all appetizers & specials on their drinks.
We'll probably be back for that.

I show up at 11pm.
They close at 1pm Monday-Wednesday.
Nice crowd.
I sit at the bar.
The wait staff are all attentive.
I order the black and bleu burger.
Delicious!
Fries was cold tho...
I can adapt.
The barista gave me a complimentary cookies and cream shake!
Nice!
My little heart was warmed... :-)

Went there with a couple female friends late night for reverse happy hour and the male bartender was rude and made derogatory remark towards my female friends.
When I called the manager over she was sympathetic but I will never go there again
