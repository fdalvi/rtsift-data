A bit pricy, but they keep a record of what you like so they can do it consistently.
Seems to work well.
The girls are always friendly, and they usually offer you a bottle of water or a soda.
I'm a regular at this point.
Coupons help, plus they have a punch card you can redeem when you fill it up.

Just spent 40 mins waiting after being told the wait was 20.
They were taking other walk ins who I suppose hap appointments but who knows.
This place needs adult supervision...won't be back.

Girls here do a pretty good job.
I get a zero on my head so i know that doesnt require that much work.
They are friendly.
I always do the VIP just to get a hot towel on my face during the wash plus an extra shoulder massage at the end.
Oh dont forget that you have a 32 inch tv right in front of you during your cut :-)

Have been coming here for years since they always do a good job, and keep track so they know exactly what I get.
Today I had Alexa (?
) cut my hair.
She did a great job, making sure it was exactly as I wanted.
After it was all done and I was walking in the parking lot, she came running out of Sport Clips after me.
I had given her an extra $20 and she was nice enough to chase after me and return it - a class act.
I will continue to come here for this kind of thoughtful service :)
