I recently purchased a car at Mark Mitsubishi in Scottsdale  .
Overall I would have to say that my experience was less then pleasant.
For starters once the purchase was made they did great cleaning up the car but left the car on empty when I went back that night to pick car up.
I requested a spare set of keys which only took over a month to get.
Personally I feel like I was a number and not a customer for life.
I don't feel as if my sales rep or the store manager really had an interests in my small requests other then that fact that I was another sale for them.
What's funny is I am now in need of an additional new car and in no way will I be looking at this dealership for my next purchase!

I really am only giving this place three stats because Mr. Kroll is amazing.
For all the money k spent in a brand new car they never offer to wash it.
And the waiting area is terrible.
I have purchased a couple cars from Mark Mitsubishi.
Not ever again.
I like Mitsubishi but I just wish this dealership has more incentives for new car buyers.
The service center is what makes the place tolerable.
They are so friendly and helpful.
No one likes to take those new car to the shop but they make it pleasurable.

HORRIBLE!!!
SCAMMERS!
DO NOT SPEND A DIME AT ANY MARK MITSUBISHI !My three year old car that I bought from Mark Mitsubishi , yes I admit didn't change oils regularly , they stated I screwed up the whole mechanic of my car giving me non stop negative diagnosis !!!
Telling me, they don't want to fix my car nothing they can do telling me I need to but a new car or pay them $7000 for repairs !!!
Threw a fit at dealership  and left !
I ended up going to Sun devil auto on bell and tatum, they told me the service department were full of crap all I needed to do was change the oil and filter!
My car was back to running perfect !
The bill was $45!
Had no problem since!
