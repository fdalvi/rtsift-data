I grabbed a quick lunch here.
Tony will definetely help you get your Greek on.
My gyro had nice fresh slices of roma tomato, fresh onions, fresh crisp lettuce and a nice tazhiki/yogurt sauce.
Tony's is basically a quick lunch or dinner spot, a step above fast food.
Credit card minimum is $10 and single items or platters are all under that so make sure you bring cash if you're ordering for one.
Just look for the "HAIR GYROS" sign as you drive down Warm Springs Rd.

Understand this is just a basic little strip mall location, nothing fancy.
This is about the food, not the atmosphere for certain.
But certain dishes are great.
I get the chicken kebabs.
There is a ton of chicken with salad and rice.
Absolutely no way I am leaving hungry after that,  I love a good kebab, and have tried all the others in the area.
Some are good, but tiny portions of chicken - but not here.
The staff is really nice, seemingly very interested in happy customers.

I got a carry-out from Tony's place today for lunch and was pleasantly surprised.
There aren't many options for quick middle-eastern/Mediterranean foods in this area, so I'm glad I found this place.
I ordered the lamb kabob sandwich and it was pretty good.
The lamb tasted like it was fresh off the grill and the other ingredients were very fresh.
My sister had a regular gyro sandwich and it had a lot of meat and seemed very fresh as well.
The place itself is very small and I would consider it mostly a take-out place.
I would go back to Tony's in the future.

Basic take out place with inside seating if you want to dine in.
Surely not a first date or fancy dress up spot.
Casual, comfortable and really good Mediterranean cusine.
We had the lamb, chicken and steak kabobs.
All great and very tasty.
Kofta is some kind of meatball if you don't know (I didn't).
They also have Gyros, ribs, hamburgers, philly cheesesteaks....Never tried those, but will be back for more Kabobs!
A great effort and a surprise for a little corner place in Henderson.
We will be back and wish the people there great success in the future.

1 word for this place...."EXCELLENT!!

*********************2.5 stars*******************************  So I decided to try greek.
Found a coupon off of Living Social and thought: "Why not?
"  The afterthought: I wouldn't come back to this place.
Not because its nasty, dirty or have poor customer service but this place was very ordinary in nature.
Nothing that left a long lasting impression.
Pro's: Good customer service.
Good portion sizes (we ordered the first gyro on the menu but i              forgot the name of it and the philly cheese steak)  Con's: The place was a bit hard to find.
The sign "Tony's place" was smaller than their Gyro, Philly cheese steak and Kabob signs that surrounded it.
The place had no AC on and so it felt somewhat like a sauna so we had to ask the guy behind the counter if we could pull a table outside the restaurant.
Mind you we live in Vegas/Henderson.
It says a whole lot that it was cooler outside the restaurant than inside.
Both of the orders were...well...Bland.
Maybe I don't know how greek food is suppose to taste but I've tasted better.
My counterpart who went with me agreed that it wasn't too tasty but it was descent.
However, when asked whether he'll pay to eat at this place again, his response was: "negative.

Sure being in a strip mall doesn't make it fancy restaurant, but as a place to grab a filling lunch or a to go order it works just fine!
The lamb gyro was HUGE and tasty.
My friend said the chicken gyro was tasty too.
They also have some good specials.
Bring a friend and get the 2 gyros with fries + 1 drink deal for around $12.
I would go back, and if you are looking for a filling Greek meal, you should too!

Pleasantly surprised!
This is decent Mediterranean that I haven't found much around here.
Recommended for a good lunch.
