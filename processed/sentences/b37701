Hard to believe there are no reviews for this place yet.
It's a really fun course in the Los Prados gated community just off highway 95 in Vegas.
It isn't a very long course, but it's just really fun to play and won't frustrate you.
Course is always in good condition, staff is always friendly, and the rates are very reasonable, especially for locals.
They don't have a driving range to warm up on, just a net you can hit into.
Carts have GPS on them.
The restaurant there has some pretty awesome food for good prices...they have a French toast variation called The Prado that is delicious.
I love the place, nice to be on a course that is short and sweet and fun to play.

Had played golf a few times there over the past 20 years and I was suprised at how nice the course looked.

Short, but fun course... worth the green fee!
Friendly staff.
No driving range.

Beautiful scenery and course.
Short and fun to play.
We stayed at the Golden Nugget and took a car service up.
Had trouble getting the service company to come back and get us!
One of the locals in the gated community brought us back.
The locals and staff were a treat, even if you shanked one into their yard.

Great course.
Staff is fantastic.
They really take care of the facilities.
It is a little on the short side (5300 yards) but it gives you the chance to work on your irons.
