I tried this place out after seeing a friend order a sandwich from here.
I looked up their menu and found some unique and delicious sounding choices.
I had their buffalo chicken sub and it was about average.
The toppings and bread tasted fresh and the chicken good.
However, I was a little disappointed with the buffalo sauce.
It was not as tasty as some I've had and it was drenched throughout the sandwich.
The service was fast and friendly.
I will probably return and try some other subs they have on the menu but I'll pass on the buffalo chicken.

Cheap and good a step up from Subway
