This place is what a local neighborhood mechanic used to be!
These guys are great at what they do.
I had 2 problems with 2 different cars in less than a month and I am so glad that I found them.
David the owner is very pleasant and professional.
The customer service he provides is unmatched.
David even offered to stay open after closing to allow my car to be towed there.
It's a pleasure to find a business that actually cares about the customer these days and with honesty, fair prices and follow up calls AFTER you have had service to see how you are doing is above and beyond what I expected.
They actually WANT you to come back!
They saved me over $200 on an alternator repair from what I was quoted at the dealership.
I will never take my vehicle to someone else.
There is no reason to.
Big THANK YOU to David and all the employees that care so much to provide an excellent experience!

Being new to this state I'm in need of a mechanic.
When my car needed brakes, I asked Wal-Mart if they did brakes to which I was suggested to check Masterwerks.
They were recommended on the basis of being fair and honest mechanics.
My visit was a pleasure.
They were able to service me right away, and I did feel as if they were being honest and not pushing about other work the car did or may have needed.
They weren't the cheapest though, but not the most expensive either (as I already had two quotes to compare).
