I recently went into sams club and had the worst customer service I have ever had at a sams club.... no one could take responsibility for there service...
I have had a tax exempt business account for about 10 years, I gave the COS my card and I will never shop there again...... they should get zero stars...

Great prices at the eating place for hot dogs and pizza.
So inexpensive.
5 stars just for that.
Sometimes they have a Groupon for membership here.
If you see that you should get it, it's a good deal and you get enough freebies and a gift card to just about make up for the membership price.
