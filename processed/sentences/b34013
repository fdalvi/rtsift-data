Great place

Always a very guilty pleasure.
I don't remember what it's called but the one that mixes waffle cone into the ice cream is freakin' delicious.
Obviously not good for the health conscious Surprisian, but as a treat every once and a while it is delicious.

I have to start with the caveat I grant most businesses of this nature... High staff turnover due to work, hours, wages, etc.
With this in mind and pretty much overlooked, Coldstone is deliciously awesome!!!
I've been to this location many times but the most recent visit was for a custom birthday cake for the main man.
Not only did they go with my quirky request, but the decorator called to make sure, then had me come in a bit early to check it so it could be altered if I was not satisfied.
Wow!!!
When I was ordering, I had a little hankering for some chocolate decadence, but true to form for me, had to be altered with some sugar free sweet cream.
I got my 'like it' home pack but they had a wee bit extra and I got a little taster to walk out the door with...
Very cool way to make me feel like a VIP.
The cake was exactly as dreamed and in no need of alteration and it was a pleasure to meet the decorator and share the reason for the design.
Keep it up Coldstone, the main man has declared you Stone Cold Awesome!!!

I thought the whole idea for the cold stone was to mix things with the ice cream you order.
Didn't happen when I was there.
The girl barely touched it, threw it in the cup, & called for the next in line.
Not impressed.
