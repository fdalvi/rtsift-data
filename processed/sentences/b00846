This is a great thrift store.
You can frequently find good stuff here at a bargain price.
All of the sales go to an important cause.
A must for Phoenix thrifting.

TALK ABOUT THRIFT MECCA!.
Shanti's is one of my fave shops to frequent on a regular basis due to wonderful prices, new inventory and an amazing staff.
I have found many a perfect piece and even snagged a HUGE (5 FOOT x 5 FOOT) Ornate Gold Picture Frame for only $75 after they marked it down by half ( that's the great customer service I was bragging about)  It is totally worth the trip to peek inside this Thrift wonderland and see what treasures you will find.

Shanti's is a great store !
Because it's next to Goodwill, it needs a lot more signage to stand apart!
Sometimes their windows are painted which really makes it stands out.
I have told many people to stop in there, but because Goodwill is so overpowering, they miss it sometimes.
That is my only constructive criticism that really is not their fault!
I always find great shoes and clothing!
For so dang cheap!!!
They often get really great furniture!
Whenever someone says they are looking for pieces, I refer them there because you never know what you'll find and it's priced to sell!
They also have tons of books for less than $1, it might be less than .50 cents actually!
They get tons of stuff and pretty much everything but furniture is less than $5 bucks.
They provide a lot of services as a non-profit and I always enjoy spending my money or donating to these types of causes.
