Stop off here a few times, never had a problem.
Service is good, the only problem is not their fault.
There is a lot of construction on the streets in the area.

Walked in took a while for them to get my order they didn't greet me.
They took forever to get the order ready.
And when they repeated the order back they got it wrong.
Would not come back here again.
Everyone spoke Spanish no one spoke English really sucks.

Food is always great, staff is friendly ALWAYS!
My dad still talks about how kind the manager was (a year later) when he visits my house.
I think some people just have to write something negative about everything.
But from personal experience this is the place to go.
They always make my day great!
Keep up the good work!
