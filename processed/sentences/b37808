Anna is amazing!
She has been doing my hair for years and I have never once had a complaint!!
She definitely knows what she's doing.
Anything you can imagine your hair looking like she can do it!!
Such amazing hair stylist!!
I will never go anywhere else

Anna is great!
I recommend her to anyone looking for quality work!

This was my first experience using Anna Ware for a haircut.
Anna did a fabulous job on my hair!
I told her I wanted something low maintenance, pretty much wash and wear, which is exactly what I got (but a little extra effort and it looks great for a night on the town too!).
It's so hard to find a stylist that really listens to what you want and what fits in with your lifestyle but Anna is exactly that.
I look forward to her taking care of my hair in the future.

Anna is very fun and very professional.
My wife loves her hair color and I drive many miles across town just for a haircut.
5 stars Anna!
