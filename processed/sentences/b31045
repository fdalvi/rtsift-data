Mike and his crew did a superior job with my recent move, and with their touch up service were able to make much of my furniture look like new!
I would highly recommend Can Do Moving for your moving needs!

Mike Brown did an excellent job of moving my antique furniture on short notice.
Prompt, professional, fast, and careful.
Five stars well earned.

We had can't do moving about 4 years ago.
Mike, the pres came out and did a great bid.
Unfortunately unless he shows up his movers complain about how they are hourly workers.
(Here's a tip if you want a tip don't complain.).
We asked for our two bedroom apartment to be moved to a three story townhome.
Which we CLEARLY explained when got the bid.
Regardless the movers complained and moaned the whole time telling us, as customers, we were under bid by their boss.
We expressly told Mike that we had no intention of packing everything as we were willing to pay but required everything to be moved out of the apartment and unpacked by the movers.
I had to contact the owner and make an uncomfortable situation as his movers took until 2 to pack us.
Which is unacceptable, being a military wife and moving every three years I used to have a team of 3 move my home goods in under 4 hours.
Needless to say the movers were mad I had to call their superior and then in order for us to move into the townhome within a day my husband and I had to help.
By the time we got our belongings in the home we were late evening.
Granted both my husband and I were helping the whole time.
They never unpacked us and to boot they broke a leg off an armoire.
I will say though mike came back after I spent days on unpacking to pay for the broken furtinure.
He paid out a cash payment for the broken item which was acceptable at the time.
But I would never refer or use this company in the future as they were FAR off their mark and had movers that constantly complained about their pay.
Hence can't do moving!
