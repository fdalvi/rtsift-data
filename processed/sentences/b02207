Great tailor.
They get it right every time!

I am a 53 year old professional speaker, and have lost a lot of weight over the last 6 months.
Historically, I have used an Italian born tailor for all of my alterations.
However, being in a pinch, I went to choi tailoring for some major alterations in my jacket and slacks.
(Major).
I was shocked on how perfect the alteration was done.
It was if the suit was rebuilt in Italy!
I have gone to other places for quick fixes before, and got what I paid for.
And had belt loops within one inch of each other, or the jacket buckling when I sit.
I can tell you with certainty, that choi tailoring is likely the best in the valley if not the state.

Great turn around on service.
I came last minute to get something altered and they did it without any complaints.
They also gave me a military discount which I appreciated.
