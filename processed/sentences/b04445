Food court location at Arrowhead mall.
Way overpriced for what they serve.
1 slice, 1 side (very small potatoes), and 1 drink was around $7and that's a meal combo "deal".
I know it's the mall, but I can do a lot better for $7.
It was very unappealing to see them carefully weigh the side portion of potatoes - OMG don't accidentally give me one potato chunk too many!
loss of profits!!
Service was rather friendly on my visit, and perhaps it was because someone seeming to be in a managerial role was working "the line".
Probably everyone has had a slice of sbarro and there's nothing special to write home about.
Side potatoes were a little too oily.
Mall crowd is lame, even though I admit I'm part of the crowd if I'm there.
I'm still miffed about the $7 "deal".
I'll go to a local place next time.

I find the prices to be too high for the quality of the food.
It really doesn't taste that great, especially the pizza.
There aren't many places I like to eat in the mall so I only come here if I'm hungry enough.

I think Sbarro has good pizza, but everybody knows that it is way too expensive and you can find better pizza at a better price elsewhere.
Although sometimes it is convenient for when you are shopping at the mall and can't be bothered to venture elsewhere.
And on those occasions I do find that their pepperoni pizza is pretty awesome!
