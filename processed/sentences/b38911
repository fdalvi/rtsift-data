This is the worst truck wash I have been to in 27 years in the trucking business.
Please don't waste your money and a lot of your time here.
The employees are screwing off, walking around and took lazy to scrub, only power wash.
The guy supposedly in charge sent someone else out to look at the dirty left on my truck when I complained.
That wash Josh in case the owner would like to fire someone.
They have music cranked up so loud in the truck bays they can't hear you say what services you would like.
I'm just sorry I had to leave a one star rating.
They are at-3 stars.

The worst customer service from the manager in charge,Rude and did not care about a simple trailer wash out that when bought back to the food shipper that rejected the trailer  to begin with look at it and said" did u get it washout,?
Looks the same" well I should have inspected before leaving and I will with these guys from now on.
The worst in my over 12 years over the road.

Never again.
The wash was not good.
I would have done better down the road at the blue beacon.
The write up person tries to upsell everything.
I also got the rig polished.
That was also done very poorly and took way longer than needed.
If the polishers would focus and not stop to talk it would have been faster.
