Shawn and his team are great.
He always has an answer for your questions and sold my house quickly.
I will continue to use them in the future.

Shawn and his team have helped us with not only selling our house but then finding us  our dream house.
He is incredibly prompt, professional, knowledgeable, and just a pleasure to work with.
I was pleasantly surprised how easy both transactions were.
We will continue to use Shawn and his team for any real estate needs in the future and continue to recommend him to all of our friends and family.
Truly a class act!

Shawn and his team helped me find my second home.
They were so pleasant to work with, always answering my questions promptly and using their problem solving skills to find the best options for me.
Thank you, thank you!

Shawn has helped our family sell our home as well as find properties.
The Mister Rogers Home Group is like family to us!
They are all very knowledgeable and they work hard to meet every need.
Thank you Shawn and the whole Mister Rogers Homes Group!
PS if you are looking for a great agent your only mistake would be to think you will find someone better.
The MRH Group is awesome.
