Okay.
I just came from the best skin treatment.
The office is clean and spacious, prices are totally reasonable and the gal who worked on me explained what she was doing, why she was doing it, told me a thing or two about my skin type and how it would react to treatment, and the lasering was completely painless and quick!
I highly recommend that you call and make an appointment with Angel Brant - she was fantastic!
I have had skin treatments before but never without that stinging, rubber-band pinch with the burning smell.
I am very surprised and satisfied with the service.

This office is a joke.
I scheduled an appointment, was given a price after verifying my insurance and then when I was seen (a 7 min apt) I was charged 3x the price I was initially quoted, with no reason why.
They were rude and uncaring and I will never go back.
There are too many doctors in this area to be treated with such disregard.

Dr. Schimke took wonderful care of me.
I'd had very strange and unpleasant stomach symptoms for several weeks and an upcoming trip that required a lot of physical activity.
He diagnosed the problem with a series of questions, rather than tests, and prescribed a treatment that had me finally feeling better after weeks of discomfort - and in time for my trip!
He also made me promise to call if I wasn't all but better by a certain point, to ensure there would be time to try something else and still get me well in time.
The lady who answers the phone is very brusque, but everyone else is warm and friendly, particularly Dr, Schimke.
The office is nicely painted and a little spare - a simple, no-frills affair that was perfect for my needs.
They also managed to fit me in for an appointment within 3 days of my call.
In case you're in the comparison-shopping business, the rate for my office visit was $143 (not the copay, full price, through my insurance company).
