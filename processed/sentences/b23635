Brian is great.
He listens to everything you say and takes it to another level.
Everyone was taking pictures next to the cake.
It looked like a piece of artwork.
He had great flavors to choose from.
The cake was moist and fluffy.
I went to 5 cake tastings and he was the best.
I guess like they say "save the best for last"  I will use him again.

My cake was awesome and exactly what I ordered.
Service was incredible!
Brian is very detail oriented and dependable.
The cake was one less detail we had to worry about for our special occasion.
We have since been back several times for coffee and muffins....cupcakes too...yum.
Very relaxed atmosphere and lots of room so you don't feel like your sitting right next to other customers.
