The hotel is not worth the money.
The beds are hard and the staff were rude.
They were the king of charging for everything   The casino was good the cocktail waitresses were on it.
While I was playing the slots they were bringing drinks way more frequently than other casinos.

Rooms are very old fashioned!
This place is screaming for some upgrades!
Other than that, it was an ordinary hotel...nothing stands out to me aside from the castle features on the outside.

Poorly maintained, expensive, no coffee makers in room, couldn't find food except pretzels at midnight - in VEGAS.
Do yourself a favor and skip this.
Booked on hotels.com, then charged a 'resort fee' on check in - for what, I don't know.
Felt safe, but that's about it.
Sheets good quality, but never changed during 4 night stay.

Old, not renovated, the pool is terrible, not up to date at all.
Probably the worst hotel on the strip.
