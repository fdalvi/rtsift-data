For the Beer Store nearby, Liquor Villa is OK.
Occasional specials offset some prices that are just a little high.
For beer, the prices are on par with AM/PM or 7-11, tho the selection is smaller.
For wine and spirits, good selection, by and large reasonable pricing and it's quick to get in and out of the store.
Friday and Saturday, they are open until 2 AM and other nights until midnight.
A nice find for that "gotta grab a beer" on my way home from work kind of evening.

I like that this place is private owned, not a big wig franchise store.
I like to support the little guy and I'd rather go here where I can get personalized help in choosing what I want.
They have chasers and mixers which is nice as well, I don't have to stop by the grocery store for those things.
They also have rare/gift items year round rather than just seasonally.
The wine selection is nice as well.

Semi sketch store They have an "OK" selection but not much Customer service is okay too Nothing much to write about
