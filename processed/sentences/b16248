Wells Fargo is the best bank in this country.
This is not my favorite location but if I just need to get cash quick, the location is quite convenient.
For foreign currency exchange and other services, go somewhere else.

This place is the worse wells Fargo I have ever been to.
I will never come back to this location.
To start with they told us our wait time would be 15 minutes that was an hour ago and the only reason were next is because everyone before us has walked out the door.
Then some most underdressed girls walk in and get helped right away for "business".
Then the banker tried to send us away.
To come back later.
This is the last time I will be here.
