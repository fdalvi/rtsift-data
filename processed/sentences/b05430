I work for an electrical contractor here in Vegas and Nedco Supply does an amazing job from ordering parts to making sure we have the right tools we need to get the job done.
There accounting department is also wonderful and very helpful.
They have multiple people  in each department to get you what you need efficiantly.

These guys are my go to for electrical parts in town.
Just keep a close eye on prices but typically they are the cheapest in town.
