Autozone and I have a love hate relationship.
Here's why.
1: Pricing.
As an example a bottle of Lucas Fuel Injector cleaner is at least $1 higher here than at their competition.
2: Batteries.
Shopping around for a battery netted me a $30 savings over what Autozone wanted to charge.
3: Quality: Autozone's lifetime brake pads and shoes have just not held up to regular use.
Pads purchased from their competition have held up and are quieter.
4: Service: Quite frankly this location seriously sucks with attitude, slowness, and just plain sloppiness.
5: Cleanliness.
Parts Stores are not bastions of cleanliness but this one is cluttered and dirty compared to other Autozone locations here in Las Vegas.
In short, sometimes they have what you need at a price that you can't beat.
But that's rare.
More often than not your best bet is to pick up the phone and call around.
You can often times find parts for less elsewhere.

I know nothing about working on cars.
I only stop in for things such as car fabreze and maybe car seat covers.
I'm such a girl LMAO.
But what I can tell you is that the staff is always polite and the store is clean enough to be a car parts store.
I can assume if their ever was a place that it would ever be ok to see dirty hands this is the place.
Long story short I enjoy shopping here and I give it five stars.

I came into  this store to buy power steering fluid then I also picked up a can to refill my Ac on the car , of course I had no clue what I was supposed to do.
Al was so helpful and knowledgable he made my trip there a breeze I will be back to this store everyone was nice :)
