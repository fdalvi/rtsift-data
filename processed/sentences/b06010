5 dollar foot long

I used to eat at this location at least once a week when I lived out here.
Earning free sandwiches was a regular thing!
The shop is always clean when I come in and never too packed.
Today's visit was in and out.
The staff was extremely nice here today and has always been when I come here.
My only complaint, and this is a vegetarian complaint so it might not hold true to most, but I wish they didn't slice my cheese on the same slicer they slice their meat.
But, I am aware of this, and could simply stop coming here.
Actually it's one of the main reasons I typically choose Subway over them.
In the end, their sandwiches are always fresh and flavorful.
I have been to the one closest to me now here and there on Hualapai and Flamingo and the same story is there.
Consistency is key and they seem to have it down.

I've always loved Port of Subs.
They're sandwiches are way better than Subway.
This location stood out because it was by far the cleanest location I've been in yet!
Even cleaner than the one by my house in Anthem.
I was very impressed by this as well as their service.

It's been over a year since i have been here.
Everything was decent the food was fresh.
The employees were very friendly and it was kept clean inside.
Will most likely be back in soon.
