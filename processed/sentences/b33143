Bought laptop from Alex and was impressed with his no nonsense style.
He was very informative and friendly.
I was surprised when he aswered his phone after business hour to help me with a problem.
Looking forward to continue doing business with Alex.

I would highly recommend  Foxetech to anyone who has computer issues.
Here is my story, we are a small business with about 15 employees, we started having  computer problems and did not know where to go.
After calling 4 different business for service and getting no response from left voicemails or someone telling me that they will call back and never do, I tried Foxetech.
We needed prompt service  because I was leaving for our office in Las Vegas the next day.
Foxetech answered the phone on the second ring , was vey helpful attempting to assist us over the phone to resolve our issues, when that didn't work I asked for service that day.
Foxetech  technician Alex said his day was full but told me he would be out to fix our issue between 5 pm and  7 pm that night.
Wow!
That's service, Alex did just what he said, he was at our door promptly and stayed until 9 pm resolving our computer issues in order to accommodate my schedule.
I will make it my mission to tell everyone I know to use Foxetech for their computer needs.
They have a lifelong customer with my company , that's what business is all about.
Thank you Alex  and Foxetech.

Nice guy.
I came in for an advertised laptop with a certain feature.
They'd sold it the day before, but he had another that was a few bucks less.
He was generous enough to upgrade the RAM for me for free.
I'd recommend this company if you need business grade used computer gear.

Bought a laptop for school.
Alex was very informative, no B.S approach which i appreciate.
I told him what i needed a laptop for and how much I was willing to spend , and he pointed me in the right direction.
Definitely my new place for computer related issues.
