Great service here!
When Jack is working the window everything is always perfect.
He makes sure your taken care of, always with a smile on his face!
Nice people make your eating experience and mood change completely!!!
I would give this location 5 stars if they didn't close earlier than normal Taco Bells.
They are my closest location from home...

This location always has great food quality and excellent customer service.

Taco Bell is known for its fast service and this location is no exception.
Food comes fresh minutes after you order it and I have never seen this one get too busy.
You must get the Dorito's Locos taco as well if you're a Dorito's fan
