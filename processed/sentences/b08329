This is a weird complaint, but I absolutely hate when I can taste dirty tap water in food.
Everything I had from this Taco Bell had a lovely City of Mesa aftertaste.

1st experience with the breakfast menu and not impressed.
Had the sausage, egg wrap.
Not a lot of flavor truly needed the hot sauce.
Probably not going back for breakfast...

Taco's!
I mean really it is a Taco Bell.
Apparently they got an "A" from the health department on 6/27/2013....

The cashier here was very rude last time I went.
I didn't even complete my order she was so rude, I just left.
Looking online at the nutrition facts, I am glad I left, there is basically nothing on the menu I feel comfortable eating after looking at the information on how horrible their rubbish they serve as food really is.
