Never had a facial in my long life, but my daughter gifted me one at Katie's.
WOW!
I'm now hooked.
Katie was awesome - gentle and firm at the same time.
And she carefully explained everything to me during the process.
I felt all aglow when she was through.
And my facial and eyebrow waxing was swift and  amazing.
Katie has made me a believer and I'll be a regular from now on.
Thank you, Katie!

OMG!!!
Have been using Epicuren Skincare Products that Katie sells.
I can't believe how wonderful my skin feels and looks.
She is a freakin' Genius!!

I am a huge stickler for cleanliness and had been looking for someone that was up to my standards.
I was also tired of people getting wax in my hair as they waxed my brows.
So I had been jumping from brow place to brow for a longtime looking for the perfect place.
I happened to find Katie on accident while I was using a groupon for a mani/pedi at a salon.
I saw the way she interacted with the other clients in the salon, she asked them questions about their needs and really was listening to them.
I approached her and asked her a few questions and if she could squeeze me in.
She was happy to.
I walked into her work space and was so delighted to see how clean and relaxing her space was.
My brows looked great!
I was extremely happy!
Needless to say I have been making the 30 minute drive once a month for the past two years just to see Katie.
I have also gotten my first facial from her and LOVED it.
I highly recommend her for all your skin care needs!
