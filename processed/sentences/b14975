Wow, so I am the first person to write a review for Foothills Sports Medicine in Scottsdale.
I have been going to this clinic actually for almost a year.
I have come here for patella femoral syndrome in my left knee, left groin problem, shoulder rehab, and rehab from accident for my neck and back.
I know, I am only 26, and I had a horrible year of health in 2010.
All I got to say, is all the problems have healed to its best.
Andy, part-owner, hires the best front desk staff, techs, and physical therapists.
I have seen a high turnover of employees that left for grad school or for another opportunity.
It seizes to amaze me on the quality of employees that come into this clinic.
The process for a session is signing in at the front desk, working on exercises with techs, getting stretched out by the physical therapists, and finishing the session with modalities such as ultrasound and ice.
They have such advanced equipment for remedying injuries.
The last funny part is they have food often in their kitchen area.
Food is brought in my patients or for certain occasions like birthdays.
I have definitely gotten a few good snacks to keep my energy level up during my exercises!

The whole feel of the place is one of knowledge and empowerment while healing.
Every one is helpful and really good at their job.
I have been going there for 8 months to work on my achilles tendon.
I have also transitioned to their personal trainer, Rich, who has been able to help me get my strength back while understanding and working within my limitations.
I highly recommend this facility to any one who needs either physical therapy or a personal trainer.

I have to say that having major shoulder surgery really sucks!!!
In addition to to the pure discomfort of the recovery time then you're forced to have to get Therapy so the surgery was not for nothing.
The one shining star was finding Jenn and Andy at Foothills.
The whole staff is so friendly and helpful.
This is a terrific location to get your Therapy done and know that you're working with true professionals.
I'm on my road to recovery and making great progress.
Thanks Jenn :)
