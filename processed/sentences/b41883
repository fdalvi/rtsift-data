I absolutely LOVE this place!
They just opened up about two weeks ago, so their salon is super clean and all of their equipment is brand new.
Not to mention their sinks are SO cool!
Lol.
May did my gel manicure and she did an AMAZING job!
The service here is beyond spectacular because they focus a lot on their customers and love interacting with them instead of with each other.
They're so friendly and very approachable.
Another plus is their prices!
Their prices are a lot lower than most salons I've been to and they do a better job.
They're very meticulous and make sure you like it before you leave their salon.
So glad I gave them a try!
I found my new nail salon!

I was getting my oil changed so instead of waiting around I decided to give this salon a try.
Super clean, nice but pricey I just got a pedicure with regular polish and I got a calluses removed ( extra $5) so I paid $30 and my feet look ok not great, was kind of disappointed!

We were there for at least two hours getting pedis and manis.
After at least an hour and a half and seeing a few nail clippings in the little basket that contained the equipment the manicurist was using on me I asked where the sanitizer box/machine was located, there it was in plain view.
I asked why I had seen three people leave and not one single employee put any equipment in the sanitzer.
The employee I was speaking with immediately put his box in the machine, I guess to shut me up.
That's not worth our health, I ended up with an infection because the employee at the place on Ann and Simmons cut me with a clipper.
Not sure how to ensure these places stay sanitary.
When I was paying for our services the owner/manager apologized for not cleaning the equipment and explained they were "just too busy.
