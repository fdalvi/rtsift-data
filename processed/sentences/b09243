We called Coyote Plumbing to replace 3 leaking hose bibs and the leaking vacuum pressure breaker leading to the automatic leveler on our pool.
We were so happy with the Cory's work, we scheduled an appointment to replace the leaky hose bibs on my dad's house.
Corey was on-time, professional and able to answer all of my questions.
Debbie in the office helped us to schedule all the plumbing work and followed up with me to make sure the work was complete.
We are already working with Coyote Plumbing to connect natural gas to our outdoor grill and remodel our shower.
I can confidently recommend Coyote Plumbing to anyone needing plumbing work in the East Valley.

I would definitely recommend Coyote Plumbing.
I had another company offer a really pricey bid on what I thought was a simple job to fix my clogged sink.
My mom referred me to Coyote for another estimate and not only did they do the same job, just as effectively, just as friendly of a tech, but they charged me $200 less than the other guy's estimate.
Simple and painless, just how it should be!

Coyote Plumbing came out today to do some repairs and Cory did an excellent job.
The price was so much lower than other plumbing companies.
We have used Coyote for years and never had a complaint.
I highly recommend them to anyone who wants quality work at a reasonable price.
There are so many other companies out there that just try to rip you off with the price, but NOT Coyote.
