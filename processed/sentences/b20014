ECA is a bit like other Edinburgh University buildings in that during the school year, students are tortured (and by tortured I mean taught and by taught I mean made to sit exams) there, while during the Fringe, it becomes a venue.
The Edinburgh College of Art, surprise surprise, offers art courses.
I've met a few photography students from there (all amazing photographers), and their fashion students are, I think, in some way, affiliated with Godiva in the Grassmarket.
Every year, the students will take over the many many buildings with a week (or so) long degree exhibition.
This exhibition is massive.
All the different students have their own sections, so there's the photography part, the fashion part, textiles, animation, etc.
It borders on impossible to do it in a day.
During the festival, I saw a great show where people in amazing make-up danced and did acro on stilts.
It was jaw-dropping.
Also, the building itself is pretty amazing.
I mean, I'm not a fan of the outside, but then inside is full of columns and huge open spaces.
If you haven't made the degree show ever, keep it in mind for next year.
And keep your ears open for news on fringe shows going on in the college.

Best views in Edina...
Very versatile spaces... Great little pub too.
