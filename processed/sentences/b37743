The folks at Foothills Sports Medicine Physical Therapy are great!
Everyone is very knowledgeable and professional, yet they treat you like family.
I was a patient of theirs for five months while recovering from a broken shoulder and surgery.
My experience with the therapists and technicians is that they listened to me (and my body), and would push me just enough to get me where my body needed to be without overdoing it.
Collectively they have a great sense of humor, and are a really cohesive team.
The team was hugely instrumental in my recovery.

Following shoulder surgery the first part of  February 2013, I began Physical Therapy at Foothills Sports Medicine on Kyrene Rd., Tempe (Formally Performance Physical Therapy), the second week of March, 2013.
All therapy personnel, Carlos, Kacie, Crystal and Daniel have gone above and beyond to attend to my recovery.
They have treated me like family and as if they are my personal trainers.
I have nothing but high regards for their professional demeanor during this extremely difficult time for me.
They all have pushed me, and pushed me to the limit.
It has all paid off !
My Doctor advises that I am recovering at a faster rate than expected.
All of that is due to the attention that I have had and continue to receive from everyone at the facility.
Thank you one and all !!

Great staff all around.
I have not been able to straighten or use my right arm for over a year.
I've had surgery and now in rehab - they have my arm 95 % straight in just a few weeks.
Very knowledgeable in what they do.
Highly recommend them.

The staff is wonderful!
The physical therapists are extremely knowledgeable and very easy to talk to.
Everyone there makes each visit warm, inviting, and fun.
I would truly recommend this environment to anyone that has to go through physical therapy.

After my knee replacement surgery they were too aggressive and I have since had to get a manipulation done.
