went to get my nails done for the first time today.
I was not impressed.
They used the rotary file to file the tips, and burned my finger, every nail was filed crooked.
I have a good mind to go get my money back!

I have been to this nail salon once before and had a decent experience.
Today I went and had the owner (a guy) do my nails.
His nails were all jagged and when he did my hand massage it was painful from his nails digging into my skin.
The pedicure was done by a girl and she did a good leg massage, she asked if I wanted my heels done and then pointed to some salt scrub I said yes, unbeknown to me that I was going to be charged extra.....couldn't understand her english I had a coupon stating I could get a mani/pedi for 32.99.
It ended up costing me $43.00 plus tip.
Not going back!
I want a place that I can understand them when they speak to me and don't nickle and dime me for everything.
Is that asking to much?

My wife and I have gone to this place countless times along with our daughter.
My wife always gets a full pedi with flower etc.
pricing is average but all of the staff are good.
I don't always want to get a full pedi, so I just get a callous removal which is $10.00.
I don't need all the extras and there seems to be nowhere else in chandler that does this for $10.00.
We will continue to go back!

I love coming to Victoria Nails.
Tina, Steven and their staff are so friendly, accommodating and talented.
They always do a fantastic job and make me heals and toes look beautiful...and the place is clean.
Once, Tina didn't like how one of my mom's fingernails looked, so she redid it without my mom even asking.
They are sweet owners.
They also fit us in, even when they are busy!
