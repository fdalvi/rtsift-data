.59 fountain drinks!
Can't go wrong!
Weird people at night, but that's any gas station.

Management here is slacking.
It's visible in the parking lot and inside the store.
What a slob of a location.
Want dates and times?
In this area you would expect better.
I certainly expected room in an outside garbage cannister to put a disposable cup but nope, no room there, because it was over flowing.
And this trashed look followed me from the gas pumps to inside the store.
WTH, I know your third shift (?
) employee(s) do almost nothing, and this was clear proof too.
Hey, why do some work when you can just let the next shift do it -and that person is there alone during the busier hours of the day.
I was just surprised by such a mess that I couldn't even put any focus on wth happened inside the store.

This is a good, convenient location and has great deals on sodas and coffees.
They also have a good automatic car wash available and discounts on the wash if you buy gas.
The down side is that this location is a nightmare to navigate.
The parking lot is always congested and is poorly set up, it is hard to find parking, and when you get in the store is crowded and hard to move around in.
This location needs a serious remodel in my opinion.
