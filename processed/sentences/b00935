Kentucky Grilled Chicken.
Nuff Said.

This KFC SUCKS!
2night the drive thru clerk asked,"Like to try our grilled wings?
" I said "yes.
" She said, "sorry- we don't have any.
" WTF?

DO NOT go to the KFC on 7th ave and Thomas, we didnt learn the first time when they gave us the wrong order, but this time we went again since we were between classes at PC, we ordered our food and Alexander took our order, the chubby hispanic woman was getting it together and was busy talking loud and talking to her co workers, we got our order and decided to eat there, our order was wrong and Alexander tells her hey you got the order wrong, she starts YELLING saying no I didnt you did, we said look on our reciept he got it right, he shows her the screen and says see, then she YELLS well it says 2 3 piece dinner and he goes yeah but it says original and the other grilled, then she YELLS again and says its not my fault HUMMM if you got the wrong order since you were busy talking and not paying attention it IS YOUR FAULT, he says sorry, and she gets our order, we started eating and not even 2 mins go by when someone goes up and says my order is wrong SHE DID IT AGAIN and Alexander tells her hey you got another order wrong and she goes back into her mumbling , the food is good if they get your order right

I very rarely eat fast food, but I was craving some crunchy chicken goodness, with a biscuit and slaw.
The only think awesome about the place?
SPORKS (why haven't they ever become mainstream, the world may never know)!
They were OUT of biscuits and dropped my change onto the pavement without offering to make it right.
They may be right down the street from me... but I will be sure to stick to local mom and pop shops going forward.

Pros: Quick, friendly service.
Consistent food quality.
Cons: greasy fast food chain in a bad neighborhood
