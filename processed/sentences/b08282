Satisfied my husband's cigar craving on a Friday night.
Will say if you blink, you'll miss it!
Not actually in the plaza, but a stand-alone building next to Main St.

Well, as soon as I got in, lady check on my ID since I look under 25 lol.
Smells smoke as soon as you open the door (expect that!
) the sales lady was helpful.
She showed me few sample and even open the whole cabinet for hookah stuff.
There's also few table if you ever wanna do a hookah session inside, of course it cost some molah.
All over experience was great and very convenient.

Sometimes I don't like to go in because it seems dirty and some of the staff looked real tweaked.
Kind of a nice humidor but don't expect real knowledgeable staff to be of any assistance.
I think a raid of this place would turn up some  unmentionables.
Proceed with a bit of caution
