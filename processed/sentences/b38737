Wow... this is a dispensary?!
It looks and feels more like a high end spa in Scottsdale or something.
The staff are extremely friendly and knowledgeable as well.
And the product is first class - 24% THC level in one strain?!
Seriously, who knew medical marijuana could look like this.
We've come a long way America!

Not what I imagined a marijuana dispensary to be.
My wife's doc recently recommended medical marijuana, We are new to this and were kind of intimidated and not sure what to expect.
We were pleasantly surprised!
This place is clean and professional with nice people and good medicine.
Comfy waiting room so I didn't have to wait in the car.
They really took the time to work with us and my wife ended up with yummy caramel corn, and slept all night!

They have a very friendly, helpful and secure staff/location.
Personalized service,  peaceful, fun and professional.
I will be back.

This place was great.
New.
Good ppl.
Great meds.
Francisco was a great budtender.
Very knowledgable.

Excellent support staff.
Very helpful and they know their products.
It was an excellent experience.
Great edibles!

Very nice place, clean, and a friendly, knowledgeable  staff.
They have Happy hour, and other specials to help you save money on your medicine.
I think the Food Drive they are having for our Veterans is wonderful.
Bring in 5 canned food items and get a free preroll.
I am happy to call them my new dispensary.

Beware of Bait & Switch offers they tell you they have something for so much a gram then when you get there they say  that they're out.
