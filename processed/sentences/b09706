Hands down, this is the best nail salon I've been to.
My "old" feet were treated painlessly from start to finish, which rarely happens elsewhere, and looked beautiful when finished.
My daughter and I went together and were both pleased with the treatment we received.
Although I don't live in Cave Creek, I plan to return ASAP.

New Nails offers the best pedicures up in Cave Creek!!!
Not only do you get a great pedi every time, their customer service is always top-notch.
I love that they use the disposable pedicure tub liners for each pedi so you know you're feet are in a clean tub every time.
It's nice that they also offer waxing too.
I've been a New Nails customer for years....won't go anywhere else!

Have had bad nail fills a few times.
Once, I had to return to get 3 or 4 nails re-done due to the owner having the girl rush thru my fill!
I do not like nail salons that are "nail factories" to see how many fills/pedicures they can get done in a day = Poor Quality
