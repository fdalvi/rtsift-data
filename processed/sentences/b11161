Not sure why reported as closed.
It is closed during school vacation times, but that is it.

This Catholic community is open all-year round!
In fact, the 7pm Sunday mass is usually the latest mass in Vegas.
With 1 mass collection, the capital campaign's goal to physically build a church is closer every week.
Parking is never an issue, even with Christmas and Easter.
It is located behind In-N-Out and close enough to walk to it after mass.
Fr.
Albert's sermons are the best.
Plus, the music ministry's songs selections, drums, bass, and keyboard keep the mass joyous.
The best place for mass in Vegas!

Over the summer, there is just a 7pm mass...such as tonight.
Since it is the summer, Fr.
Albert is on vacation and local priests are filling in for him.
Since the mass serves the college community, the sermon is usually short and mass is usually done in 1 hour.
Plus, parking is plentiful.
The best kept secret in Vegas!
