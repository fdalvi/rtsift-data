Nice selection in bulk.
Fresh fruit and veggies looked better than any grocery store.
Cheap prices and clearance items.
Friendly staff.
Very clean store.
AMAZING lay out.

-Conveniently located next to Trader Joe's.
-Purchase food or janatorial items in bulk...like a teeny fraction size of Costco.
-Clean store.
-Service...not so great.
:(   -Each time I have stopped in here, there is one cashier and 4-5+ customers in line (like Hobby Lobby).
-Most prices are not so reasonable to lure me back.
-Observed two employees chatting in the aisle, instead of opening another register to expedite customer check-out.
-After deciding NOT to wait in the long one-cashier line, I left my "potential purchases" near the register.
Instead of opening another register to assist with checking out customers, another employee wasted no time scooping up my abondoned items.
-I'm surprised that this business is still open.
You get a vibe that the employees hate their job and that management is terrible.
