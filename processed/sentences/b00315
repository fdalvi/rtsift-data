Although this seems to be a 'hydroponics' store (as far as products they carry and the culture/attitude of the place-a bit different of a feel from the 'upscale', or 'mom-and-pop' type garden centers),  it has a number of organic fertilizers and amendments (liquid and solid), seed starting mixes and organic soil mixes and other seed starting supplies useful for the outdoor organic gardener that likes to start their own transplants.
They moved to a bigger location up the block last year and I haven't had a chance to fully explore the new store.
They seem to carry a large selection of lights, etc for indoor growing but I am not in the market for those.
It is in a somewhat obscure location in what seems like a light industrial/manufacturing area but worth the trip over there every spring to get what I need (it's also across the road from Farm and Fleet if you need any materials/supplies from there).

Awesome store.
I don't know much about indoor gardening but thestaff is super helpful and will walk you through the process, hassle free.
They also carry some things for the outdoor gardener as well as some plants (i have cacti and asparagus tips from there).
Paradigm also carries some fun random things, like frisbees, gourmet chocolates, and handmade soaps and potions from a woman in fond du lac.
Oooh, I almost forgot, they also have workshops once a month, like rainwater harvest and storage, compost tea, and intro to composting.
Most are free, except for the pepper workshop, where a man dubbed Dr. Dave brings in dozens of different peppers, shows you how to care for the plants and what you can make with them.
Plus you get goodies, like candied peppers, pepper jam, pepper beer, pepper ice cream... On and on.
All the workshp info is on the website.
Anyway, awesome store!

Place is fantastic!
Best in Madison.
For all things growing - inside and out.
Nice to be in a store where employees actually know what customer service means.
