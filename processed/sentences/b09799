As a business owner I need to know the products I request are done to specifications.
These guys are the best.
They always make time to discuss my order and ensure that I get exactly what I want.

I ordered Fire Department shirts for a department here in the valley.
I ordered these shirts a month or so before I needed them.
They have me a date that I could pick them up a week prior to the date I needed them.
When I showed up on the date they were said to be finished they said they were busy and I'd have to come back in three days.
I was on shift that day so I came in the following day.
Guess what, they're still not finished and I'm here writing this post as I wait.
I'm giving them two stars just because I'll have them by the time I need them.

They were great and helpful.
We had our youth soccer shirts done here.
They got the shirts to me on time and exactly how I wanted them to be.
Very affordable and would definitely recommend them.
