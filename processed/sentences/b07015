Not quite decided about this place.
I went once with my mom, and had a great salad with apples, cranberries, and blue cheese.
The soup was good too, some type of southwest chicken with rice and beans.
They also have tasty cookies, and muffin tops(which is the best part, let's face it).
Recently when I went, I just ordered soup.
I think it was supposed to be Chicken Enchilada or something.
Disgusting.
I was pissed that I paid almost five dollars for a bowl of thick, gloppy soup that tasted like someone just opened a bag of wholesale condensed nonsense.
Good thing the iced tea was decent.

Minimal bagel selection on a Sunday morning was disappointing.

I like Panera more than this place.
Their menu is not that extensive and the ambiance was just drab.
I had the chicken noodle soup which was mediocre at best.

Bleh.
Atlanta Bread Company is one of those trendy "fast-casual" sandwich shops that were a big deal about five years ago.
Subpar soups, okay sandwiches, but by no means worth making a special trip.
The best thing I've had there was a chicken pesto panini, but even that was simply average.
I can't imagine anybody would be excited to go here; the menu is very simple and the food doesn't even live up to its low expectations.
The decor is nice but the restaurant itself is far too large.
The last few times I've gone there have only been a few other tables occupied.
The call-out-your-number style of picking up your food seems unnecessary given the usual amount of customers; I think it would be an improvement if they took the food out to you ala Noodles & Company.
The bakery is expansive but mediocre.
The cookies are large but I could make better at home.
I haven't tried much else from the bakery (I'm too eager to leave) but I have no real desire to return.
Final verdict: Not bad, but don't bother.
