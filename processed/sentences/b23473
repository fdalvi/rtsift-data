AZ DPS is awesome!
Very proactive and will make contact with anybody, anywhere in the state of Arizona.
They also now staff the Capital Police Dept.
Essentially, Capital PD is a division of the AZ DPS.
They have no issues on doing traffic stops, ped checks, backing up other PDs as well as doing house cleaning in the ghettos (raids).
On the flip side, you have to be driving like a real bonehead to get stopped.
To get cited or arrested, means that you where either wanted, a jerk to officer, or you were driving way too stupid.
Examples of this include 20 over the speed limit in the city, no insurance or DUI.
Thanks AZ DPS for the enforcement.
