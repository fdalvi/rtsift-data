I guess I can't hope for much from a gas station other than that they sell me gas and offer a cool beverage if I need one.
This place does both of those things.
It's actually a fairly large station.
But, I wasn't nearly as happy here as I am at my local Arco, which is still just moderately happy.
I waited quite a while for one of the three available cashiers to acknowledge me.
When one finally did, she looked at me sideways when I paid, but then again I did pay with some $2 bills.
It was very difficult to get in and out of the parking lot during rush hour, because it's on a busy corner with just-awkwardly-enough placed driveways.
If you're paying cash, it's some of the cheapest gas in the neighborhood!

Well, if you are the only gas station in a couple of blocks then you can price gouge anybody.
I went in to grab a drink and I was surprised that they were .50 cents higher than Circle K or Quick trip.
So I decided to get it anyway, then when I wanted to use my debit card they wanted a .35 cent fee to use debit.
Really???????
Now I am paying almost $1 more for the same thing.
And the cashier could have taken happy classes on how to talk to customers.
Next time the extra few blocks of gas will be worth it verse the waste of space.

Some of the cheapest gas around and a pretty decent car wash. One of the few Arcos around that will let you use your credit instead of debit card.
After getting burned by using my debit card at a gas station (card info got swiped and some foreign interest tried to take me for everything I have and then some) I will never use debit at stores/gas stations again.
I'm so happy they made the update!
