Actually was in the costa.
which is quite small but adequate.
Seems to be on basic staff and the coffee is alright.
should've had syrup in it as it really needs it.
it's a costa - nothing more nothing less.
another chain with it's basic requirements.
not my favourite costa though, but it's seating seems to have had a re vamp which is nice to see.
