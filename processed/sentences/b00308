I had a good experience at this nail salon.
Everything was pretty standard but clean & tidy.
They offer all basic services & they also have shellac nails, which I haven't tried but it's nice that they were up on the trends.
The technicians were all male so they had NASCAR on the TV in the pedicure chair area; that was ok but my technician kept turning to look over his shoulder to watch the race, which was a lil annoying.
However, he listened when I asked him to be careful with my cuticles, some technicians at other places have actually cut me in the past, and he wasn't skimpy on any portion of the pedicure and manicure, including foot and hand massage.
Overall, it was a good experience and reasonably priced and I would go there again.
I took off one star because of the NASCAR-watching.

Went in to have a shallac manicure replaced.
To remove my previous manicure they used the same file that they use to file your nails down to give you a set of artificial nails.
I now have ridges that were not in my nails before I went in.
I also feel like the man who did my nails was very rude.

Nice people.
Not enough staff to accommodate walk-ins that they advertise for.
Pretty sure Andy (technician) does not know how to do shellac.
Didn't have all the bottled products.
But said each product line is different.
Placed my hands in the drier and the polish bubbled and my hands began to sting.
I said I don't think this right seeing that I've had shellac done before.
He said just put the tips of your fingers in.
Still in pain I declined to go further and asked to have it removed.
