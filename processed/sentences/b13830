Most ghetto Walgreens I've ever been too.
People outside begging for money.
Exit is blocked off by the register so you have to walk around even if you go to the liquor side.
Employees look like they hate their jobs.
Other than that this place is great.

Now, this is a Walgreens (and I've been too quite a few in my life)!
Sure it's in the ghetto, but they have excellent sales (I got a pack of Newcastle for an unheard of $6.99).
Then, in addition to giving me superb service, the young guy at the cashier gave me a $5 coupon on top of my overall purchase.
It's true- first impression are important.... and this Walgreen's is doin' it right!
I'm putting a big stamp of approval on it!
