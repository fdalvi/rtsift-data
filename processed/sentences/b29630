This place has really good Greek food that is fairly inexpensive.
Its in the mall so the ambiant noise can be quite loud.

For mall food this place is great.
Love the pitas, rice, and yummy potatoes.

Went to the mall the other day with my son and stopped here for a gyro and was pleasantly surprised to find it pretty satisfying.
I wish the meat was cut up smaller but the sauce and the pita were great together.
I even got sweet potato fries.
Its the mall so i am not going to go crazy here, but I would go back again.

Every time I come to Arrowhead Mall I eat at this place!
They are always friendly and fast.
Plus the food always seems very fresh.
They don't skimp on the feta or veggies in their Greek salad which is always my complaint for Greek places.
The jalapeno hummus is delicious and a must have when you come here.

Holy cow!!
Their Gyros are awesome!!!
Good salads too!
Service and prices are good too!

The mall is not always the best place for a food review but I really like this place.
The people working their are not the happiest but do not allow that to stop you!
I totally suggest the berry feta salad with chicken, it is the da bomb because the carmalized nuts are amazing!
I always get sweet potato fries and a gyro to share with my daughter as well.
Quick service and amazing taste!
