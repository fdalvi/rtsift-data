I couldn't find Taco City but the Rocky's/TacoCity are the same business.
The soft shell tacos are small I'm used to big hungry-man's portion of tacos.
Did they change the size?
It seemed to take forever in the drive-thru and I was the only customer in line.
Do they just fool-around since their used to closing so early.
It was right after 8pm but not close to 9pm.
I always order my pizza thru pickup so I'm surprised they haven't shut down yet.
What   would I do if they shut down?

The drive thru is the issue here.... One word SLOW.
I'm a huge Rockys fan but I'll drive to the east side location bc this location is just way too slow!
It takes a solid 10-15 min.
For the drive thru and sometimes the pizza is old and  nasty bc its sat too long.
It's too bad bc there's not alot of competition on the north side.

they are now CLOSED FOR BUSINESS!
You have to go to the eastside one now if you want to have Rocky's.
