My wife and I went here for one of our dates.
It is an in door batting cage.
The staff was really friendly.
They have awesome equipment and the pricing is very reasonable.
They use great pitching machines, so fine tuned adjustments can be made.
I highly recommend fence busters for your kids or date nights.
I believe they also provide coaching as well.

I love how close I am to this place.
We are in Phoenix .. most of the time it is hot as hell here, so having a nice indoor training facility like this is pure AWESOME.
Prices are very reasonable too.
I remember paying 1.50 for 10 pitches back in the day, when you can get non stop pitches for 30 min for 24 bucks here.
They also have other packages too that might end up being cheaper if you do batting cages A LOT.
They have loyalty cards too, where you can get some free time in after so many visits.
I highly recommend this place.
The owners are passionate about baseball.
You can see it everywhere in this place.
They are nice, and very helpful.
If you don't own bats or helmets or anything its ok - they have anything and everything you might need.
They also have clinics on certain days - make sure and call and see when they are.
Lots of willing people to help all the time.

Great place to go if you're near Gilbert or Queen Creek.
Definitely worth the drive.
Like the pay by minutes instead of hassling with tokens.
Plenty of batting cages for both softball and baseball.
