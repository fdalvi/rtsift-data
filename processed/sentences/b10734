My husband and I visited the store while in Vegas celebratinging our ten year wedding annivesary.. We were just looking but ended up leaving with a fantastic ring.
Cher and the creww were great.
they took the stone from my ring and placed it in a new setting.
It is Breathtaking.

great store!!!!!!!!
Stuart Berger is the greatest!

I like high end watches and this store has some.
Unfortunately, none of the brands that I'm looking for.
But this store was the first one to introduce me to Ball watches.
Cool factor up high on this since they have gas luminescence built in the dials, a unique feature that I don't know exist with any mechanical watches today.
Maybe one day, I will buy one.

I needed to get a vintage ring sized that I had purchased elsewhere while I was in Vegas.
You wouldn't believe how hard it is to find a place on the strip that does this!
I stopped in at Fashion Show Mall after a shop at the Wynn and the Concierge recommended trying there.
The staff was super friendly and sized the ring with zero problems.
They even spiffed it up with new plating and cleaning- all done within a couple of hours.
Pick up was easy and quick.
Simple job but no complaints and done quick.
Good by me!
