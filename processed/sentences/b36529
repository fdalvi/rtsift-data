Straightforward and easy to use.
The circuit is perfect for a quick workout.
Lots of cardio machines and a large free weight area.
It is an unpretentious gym and i love it!

Great little gym!
I like it because its close to home and I can go to other youfits with my lime card and workout with friends and family.
The equipment is always super clean, the staff is friendly... What more can you ask for??

Just signed up at this location and LOVE it!
The staff is very nice and I've never had an issue getting on the machine I want.
The place is very clean all around and it offers a non-threatening environment for those who are trying to get back into shape.
I look forward to going in and working out every day!

First of all let me say the place is clean and the staff is very nice.
My wife and I both joined a year ago and signed up our daughter as well.
I thought it was weird that they took out 3 separate payments each month instead of one payment for the 3 of us but now I understand why.
My wife and I haven't used our membership for months so we went in to close it out and found out there is a $25 fee for canceling the membership, and it is not just one fee, it is $25 per person.
So I had to pay $50 to cancel a membership that neither my wife or I have used for months.
I am VERY upset.
If you read many review sites you will see I will be re-posting this everywhere.

I am really happy with this gym.
They have every piece of equipment I could want, and enough of everything that I rarely have to wait for anything.
The staff had also been very friendly.
You can't beat the price.

Beyond aggravated right now.
Buyer beware - your membership is NOT what it seems to be.
They up your membership fee with no warning & when you try to cancel they charge a "processing" fee.
So much for convenience & not paying for more than you need.
