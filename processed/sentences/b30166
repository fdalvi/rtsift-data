Both my half frozen fingers (it was under 70 degrees!
) & my empty tummy really appreciated the freshly brewed coffee selection & the quick check out (with a genuine smile!
) at this local Circle K. I was feeling adventurous, so I went with a mixture of the hazelnut & cinnamon.
I'm just crazy like that :)

Great snacks at the register

This place is whack.
The worker was a total weenie and pretty creepy too.
I'd go to one of the other places down the street.
