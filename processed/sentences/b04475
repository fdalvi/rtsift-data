Very beautiful parish.
The congregation is polite but not overly friendly.
Usually have donuts and beverages after mass.
School children fundraise and sell newspapers.
Recommend going to the sides to get your communion- real fast.
Also, last mass is at 11 AM.

Excellent Roman Catholic Parish with a great diversity of ages and ethnicity.
Thrust stage style altar arrangement puts the priest and service at the center of the people.
Beautiful, huge stained glass window on wall in back of altar.
Beautiful modern style church overall.
Very good formal choir at 9:00 am Mass.
Typically very good homilies from the Priests.
Lots of programs available for participation and education.

STM is a beautiful church with a very active and financially blessed congregation.
There is a great deal of diversity among the parishioners, which includes people of all ages and ethnicities.
Father Jim Turner is an exceptional pastor and his homilies are both insightful and relevant to the audience, as well as the day's scripture readings.
He skillfully employs practical analogies and personal experience, along with an appropriate level of humor, to proficiently relate to--and maintain the attention of--the laity.
There are a great number of ministries and organizations that are open to parishioners, and the church as a whole is very generous and active in the community.
