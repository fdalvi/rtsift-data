I had a veggie sandwich.
The bread was fresh and it was pretty darn tastey.
Servers were very friendly and accomodating.

Great service & food!

i love their mac and chesse, but was a bit disappointed to see it in a plastic bag being microwaved.
for some reason i always thought it was fresh and warm.
