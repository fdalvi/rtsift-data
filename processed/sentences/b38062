LOVE THIS Place!!!
First, It's CLEAN!
I mean everything is clean.
And when you do whites, hot water actually comes out!
All OVER-SIZED washers and it even has the biggest washer i've ever seen and the largest dryer I've ever sen in there too!!!
And affordable.
each wash is 1.50 and dry is .50 AMAZING Place!!!!
will only go here from now on... AND they have a special thing... Every 12 washes you get a free one!!!
Can't be beat!!!

Used this laundry mat to wash my slip covers.
I researched the area, and found this wonderful, cleanest laundry mat I have ever been in.
Kathy was the attendant on duty, she was so friendly and helpful.
Looking for  good clean (washing machines are spotless), this is the one!!
Thank YOU!
