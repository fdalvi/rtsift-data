I'm reasonalby sure that Jack puts crack in those tacos.
99 cents for two tacos is crazy!
And yes, I know they are kind of greasy and they don't use the most amazing ingrediants but there is something about them..... My other favorite item is the chicken fajita pita.
It's a great option if you don't want a burger.
The fries are decent and they have a nice variety of options to choose from.
And I must admit Jack's commercials are funny.
Thanks Jack!

This is the worst Jack in the Box around.
The customer service at this place is consistently terrible, to the point that I stopped going long ago.
Half the issue is having employees whose English is unintelligible.
If you can't understand English - which is the language of this land (last time I checked, anyway), how is a person reasonably expected to be able to correctly take an order?
One time I was there, I asked for 2 Jumbo Jacks, hold the mayo.
I had to repeat myself 4 times to the attendant before they finally understood.
When I got home, the burgers were slathered with mayonnaise.
Another time I got 2 regular burgers instead of the sandwich I had ordered.
Another time, apparently it was a shift change and I stood there for several minutes, waiting for someone to help me.
All of the employees were RIGHT there, completely ignoring customers at the counter.
The last time I went, I again requested no mayo.
This time, however, when they handed me my bag full of food, I opened it up and laid it all out on the counter and then began opening each item (I was buying for 4 teenagers besides myself, I had a lot of food there).
My burgers were again slathered with mayo.
I called the manager of this store a couple of times hoping they might be able to get this place in order, but that dream never materialized.
I no longer go to this Jack in the Box and go to the one at 24th Street and Baseline instead (MUCH better service there with people that actually speak English!

Stopped in for a bite today & found this Jack in the Box to have a nice, comfortable dining room and counter service from friendly Ariana was great!
Armed with a coupon out of the weekly shopper tabloid for a free "Monster Taco" with any purchase, I added two regular tacos (99¢) & 2 cups of super good Frank's Red Hot Sauce (free) from the secret menu.
What a terrific light lunch for only 99¢ at a Jack in the Box where everything was just right!
How can Enya keep from singing, & how can I keep from giving this place 5 Stars?
:-))
