Used to be Coyote Alley: a gritty, mismanaged dive bar catering to the upper crust low life's of the surrounding greater Surprise area.
Now...essentially heaven's waiting room.
The lights are too bright, the color is horrific, overall feel is generic and sterile and the barmaids are funny and nice, if not a bit slow.
The drinks are reasonably priced and the owners are involved and considerate.
Suppose to put a kitchen in someday, and if they do a fish-fry on Friday's they will likely make good money, but, essentially will push anyone out that is under sixty or doesn't require an oxygen tank!!!
Good luck.

Looks like they've dimmed the lighting and the drinks are well priced.
Came back for the second time to give the place another chance.
Two pool tables .75 for a game .
Still don't like like the paint, maybe still just a little bright.
No need to tell the bartender to turn the jukebox up.
Overall , looking good

Cheap drinks, great bartender, close to home - gets a thumbs up from me.
The bands that have played are pretty good as well.
The only complaint?
Get a bouncer or someone who will kick out the creepers!
When I say "no" to dancing with you, it means "no" not "come back in 15 minutes and try again".
