Excellent service - Roger responded to a trouble call, refrigerator not working in June and worked through the problem in a thorough and logical approach.
Saving him time and me money.
Problem was quickly resolved at a great price.
Definitely recommend his service.

By the time Roger is done fixing your appliances, you will be reminded there are still good people in this world.
Took my call at 9 pm, walked me through a troubleshoot.
Brought the parts to fix almost the whole fridge.
Was grateful for his service.
