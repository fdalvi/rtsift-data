An appropriate review for 4/20 if there was ever one!
I'll be honest, I've never shopped here for the tobacco selection...the pipe portion is what has always caught the attention and taken the cash.
The handful of pieces I've held that were procured from here were all top notch!
Nicely designed, thick glassed, and very fairly priced.
The staff have always been very nice and will let you examine anything and everything your little smokey heart desires.
Nice designs are important so you can gaze upon something visually stimulating in between sessions.
Thick glass is important because smokers tend to be a little more clumsy and butterfingered than the average citizen.
And fair prices...well no one can argue with that.
My old roomie got Dr Evil from here: a 3 foot lung-assassinating tube that sent his enemies to either the closest located Big Boy Burger or to a tank sporting sharks with frickin' laser beams attached to their frickin' heads.
So if you're shopping for pipes, papers, bubblers, or death tubes, come here.
The Dude knows a good piece, and Mr Bill's delivers!

Small selection but a good attitude

A real fine shop !
Very complete....Great tobaccos !
I was very impressed ....Great humidor and cigar selection...!
