Unfriendly people = no tip for you

Silvia is an amazing hairdresser.
I have been going to her for over 2 years and I have yet to come out with a bad cut.
My mom and roommate now go to her too!
She is wonderful!

Tell them what you want your style to be.
Get it.
It's that easy.
They've been here for 20 + years - My only wish is I'd started coming here sooner.

I have been a client at Studio Fx for years.
Liz does an outstanding job with weaves/cuts and Krista is amazing with shampooing and styling your hair.
I always get complimented on my hair.
