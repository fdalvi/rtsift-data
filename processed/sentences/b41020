I like it!!!
I am a seafoodie.
Lobster , oysters and crab legs during dinner time.
I am surprised by the price.
Only 12.99 for dinner.
I think it's my favorite buffet.

It's a good place to dinning Chinese food,low price but high quality.i really like here!
Yummy!

Today I ordered hibachi, too.
Everything was great.
I think they all did good jobs.
And I noticed that they got 5 A cards.
Good!

I use to eat there one's week, it was close for while.
It is reopen now, I stop by for dinner today, it was great, they have lobster for dinner only $12.99 including drink.
I can't believe it, they have all kind of seafood, you name it and beet shore rib is great.
Sushi are fresh and wonderful.
Great job!
Keep up!
This is still my favorite place for buffet in town.

Staff very nice, food is horrible, no taste...go to BUFFET ASIA, same price better food!

I hate leaving bad reviews but this one deserves it.
I spat out half my choices.
They even managed to stuff up the ice cream.
I'm not a fussy eater at all but this place is bad.
Tough n chewy covered in sauce to make it edible.
