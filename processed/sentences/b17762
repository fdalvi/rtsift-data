This is a great little mexican shop.
i love their steak tacos and all the salsa is good.
would have given them 5 stars but they recently changed management and started charging me for guacomole and sour cream.
i hate litte ad ons

I agree with Than.
Quite often I'm dismayed by the blahness of many local Mex joints.
Considering how many we have and our proximity to the border, it's amazing how average most places tend to be.
Las Brazas is a notch higher.
It's not a place to go for margs with friends, or a special outing... you pour your own Pepsi here and watch soccer on TV as the jukebox blares Mariachi music.
But the food is good, plentiful and seems to be cooked by someone wanting to be a little different.
Again, it's a strip mall place and not a dining destination... but if you like Mex food, are in the area, and simply want a decent meal - it'll fit the bill.
Also love the free chips and salsa bar!

Las Brazas has great food at inexpensive prices.
The staff is friendly and courteous.
My sons and I eat there frequently.
Las Brazas is in the price bracket of Filiberto's, but the quality of the food is a couple of notches higher.
You can't beat Las Brazas for the prices.

Stopped by today and it has closed shop.
Out of business.
Sad!
