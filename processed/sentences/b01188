Victor is the fastest!
You don't spend your precious time time waiting for an over booked stylist.
Walk in with a need for a cut and walk out with a new look.
The shop is convenient to all areas of town.
Go get pampered.

Victor is excellent.
Not only is he very skilled in cut and color, his prices are reasonable.
I have received compliments on my cut and have many friends who now go to him and are very happy.
You won't be disappointed.
The staff is friendly and courteous as well.
