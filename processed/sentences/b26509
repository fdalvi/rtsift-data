Very visible location, right outside of Saks Fifth Ave. (or another department store, whatever, they have directories all over the place)  Very friendly staff.
They always have such great suggestions.
A rather small store, but still has a wide variety of jewelry and charms.

Living in Vegas, I have visited all the Pandora stores...and there are many.
I would love the Tivoli Village location to be the one I frequent the most, since it's the only one not on the strip and super close to home, but their customer service is lacking.
It's just not up to par.
This location, in the Fashion Show mall, exceeds all my customer service expectations.
I went in there on a very busy day, while they're running one of they're greatest promotions of the year (did someone say free bracelet?
) and Kelly was so helpful and patient.
I enjoyed talking to her and appreciate that she showed me every charm I asked for and some I didn't even know existed that she knew I'd love!
I can't imagine not going to this store and not having Kelly help me with my selections!

As previous folks have mentioned, it's highly visible spot beside a large department store on the corner of the upstairs.
The shop is incredibly brightly lit, and well kept.
The store was busy the day we were there, but to their credit.. the staff did their best to make sure we knew we were next to be served.
We wanted to get her a Vegas memento and Pandora delivered.
They had a pair of dice and then a money bag, or horse shoe that you can only get in Vegas.
Great little idea, and they will be taking it out of circulation soon, so we got a great deal.
Pandora is a well thought out alternative to your mom's old charm bracelet.
And it's not really that expensive when it comes to jewelry.
