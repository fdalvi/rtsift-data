Well, we needed lunch what can I say?
It's an Arby's so most people do not admit to eating here anyways.
This location has all the things you would expect from an Arby's in Sun City West.
Old people, annoyed employee's, and a loud bell to ring on the way out if you felt your service was great.
Cmon, it's an Arby's.
Lost the bell.
The roast beef is borderline food product.
Use this as a last resort.

Just purchased an ultimate BLT and it was disgusting!!!!!!
Was of very poor quality, burnt bacon(and very little) under ripe tomato(2 small slices) and wilted lettuce.
I threw it out.
This is not the first horrible sandwich I have gotten at this establishment.
Horrid is all I can say.
Don't waste your time or money frequenting this Arbys.
I guess they think the elderly can't taste or see.
Wow

I found nothing wrong.
Nice staff.
Food was fine.
No complients here :) mananger was super cool.

Thanks Arby's, You made a mistake with my order then when you found out that it was wrong you made it right by replacing the entire order the next day without being asked.
The food is great and the kitchen is clean
