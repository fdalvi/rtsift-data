I love this place!
David Hanna, who I believe is the owner is on top of his game.
I have been going here for about two years.
The first time I took my car in, I told David that there was something wrong with the rear brakes, and could also have a boot issues.
When I returned to pick up my car, I was charged $35 for an oil change.
He explained to me that though in the next 8 - 10 months I should have my brakes replaced, there is nothing wrong with them.
Many shops would have screwed me and just taken my money.
The other thing that is great about them, is that they will work with you on what needs to be done.
They give you a list of must Di's and nice to Di's, then will tell you all of it should be done by 'X' date.
They are great, Prices are fair, not cheap but fair.
And get on their mailing list and coupons come to you to help you out.
