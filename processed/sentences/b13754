I never thought the day would come when I'd be writing a review about fast food.
Here is the deal, this Jack in the Box is right next to my work and I happen to be a big fan of their iced coffee.
I stop in every morning to get it and if I don't my day just isn't right.
I am not a fast food person so all I can comment on is the iced coffee and the service.
I have created a following at work, my coworkers are now addicted to the iced coffee as well.
It actually tastes like coffee and you don't feel sick to your stomach after drinking it.
The service...this place is always busy and they are quick and efficient and the staff always has smiles on their face.
Special shout out to Perla, who is a sweetheart and I can tell is going places.
She always asks how my day is and has excellent customer service skills.
She can't help but make you smile!
I would give them five stars but out of principle I simply can not...it is a fast food place after all!

The drive through can be a strange place when you don't know what you want as you arrive.
Suddenly those signs on the window start looking good, but you know the food is going to look better than it tastes, yet you can't decide what greasyy thing to shove into you so you just go for it.
This was my exact scenario as I rolled through here near my lodging.
The signs for the new Cheesesteak melt seemed pronmising, but upon eating the thing we find some form of steak that doesn't even compare to steakumm's in quality and a mess of white cheese folded inside.
The sourdough bread was grilled nicely and the fries were crisp, but I will now have to return to the dollar menu where I belong.
The extra star is for the mini-pancakes on that menu.
Ten silver dollar beauties with butter and packaged syrup - how can you go wrong with that?

Quickest jack in Phx with friendliest staff
