Staying on a sweet tip, Starbucks stock a variety of cakes, muffins, cookies and tray bakes these days.
Alongside staples like chocolate caramel shortbread, carrot cake and chocolate fudge brownies, they have a selection of more seasonal treats like lemon tart, raspberry and coconut squares and strawberry cupcake with white chocolate curls.
The problem is, they look better than they taste.
Really.
I shared a couple with my better half and within one bite, we could tell they were (A) frozen and (B) had more sugar than butter, eggs and flour.
Guess that's what you get for snacking at a corporate chain instead of an independent, right?

it's starbucks and i love starbucks, but the girl behind the counter was rude to me and it was only just past 7am.
so sorry, lothian road starbucks you only get three stars.
maybe you should teach your staff how to be nice, especially to early morning customers on their way to work!!

Not what I'd expect T-shirts, blue jeans and tattoos Quality was ok
