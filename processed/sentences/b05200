This is the only Well Fargo I use but I have never been inside.
I am able to depost and withdrawl from the ATM.
Always has been convenient.

Have you ever wondered how WFB can survive?
In my neighborhood, within a 3 mile distance, there are 4-5 Wells Fargo full service banks and I came in here to turn in my daughters rolled quarters:  a.
Service - The teller was great.
He was wearing a sweater so I could not get his name.
He was helpful, easy going, professional and gave me some advice about accounts for my teens that was actually helpful.
Then he introduced me to their manager and that was cool to.
First class in my book.
I wasn't worried about "being sold" to open more accounts as I would do it online anyway and it does not cost anything extra... Great service.
Location - Right on Eastern and St. Rose Parkway.
Easy in and out, outdoor tellers and also two outside ATM and inside as well.
c.  ATM - If you take over 100 from the ATM, you might get some 50's with it.
If you go to the ATM inside the bank, you generally get 20's only.
Overall, I liked the service and the friendliness.
I was on verge of leaving WFB for the exact reasons I like this one.
I felt anonymous, and indifferent.
Today, the experience here was great.

I am reviewing on my visit this morning.
A young man named mike did not help me or try to help me.
I had several issues to handle.
One was a lost debit card and then wanted to cancel another account.
I just returned from out of town.
My drivers license expired 2 days ago.
This was my stop before DMV.
I had a credit card and health card as well as the 2 day expired drivers license.
He said he couldn't help me because of the expired license.
NO attempt was made to verify my identity which would have been easy...guess didn't like his attitude..
I have been to other branches where they go out of way to help...
