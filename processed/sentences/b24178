One liner:  Depends on who you get...
I have been here several times and have had both good and so-so experiences.
It totally depends on the student you get for your services.
What I will say is that if you find a good one, reschedule with them!
If you want some pampering, this is a good way to go.
The facials are pretty good and only $20!

Looked okay for haircut but would not necessarily recommend for a pedicure.
Half of the reason to get a pedicure is the relaxing experience and this set up is just not ideal.

My first time here and it was great!
I came in for a haircut and, having been to other beauty schools before, I knew it could take awhile.
I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in and the student who was going to cut my hair (Kelsey) came right out and got me.
She sat me down in her chair, asked me what I wanted done with my hair, asked clarifying questions and then called her instructor over to let her know what I wanted done.
After that, I got a nice shampoo and then she got to work cutting my hair.
She mentioned that it was her first day on the floor and I got a bit nervous when I heard that, but Kelsey seemed very confident and capable and she cut my hair exactly how I wanted it (I've had problems at other schools with students wanting to cut it differently than I want it).
I liked that it only took an hour or so and the instructors were readily available to help the students when needed.
Overall, everyone was very friendly, Kelsey was a great stylist, I got an awesome cut, and it only ran me $9!
I'll definitely be back for another haircut and maybe to try a facial.
