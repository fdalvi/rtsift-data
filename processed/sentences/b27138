This is my favorite radio station.
For music, it's a good mix of hip hop, freestyle, and dance music- in other words, music to dance to at a party.
It allows me to enjoy my morning commute.
Just like the name of the station, it's music that makes me feel good.
And sometimes relive a memory when I hear a song from back in the day.
Hope the format stays the same.

I like this radio station because they play a bunch of Old School songs from the 80's & 90's and mix it in with some newer stuff.
Very mainstream though.
It's always a fun station to listen to.
