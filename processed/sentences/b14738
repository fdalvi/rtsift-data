Skip this one, and go to the one up the road (Val Vista) near Home Depot.
Could be the same owners, for all I know.
This one is dirty and will screw up your order every time.
But they make up for it by serving it COLD!
They just don't care.
We've been there several times, as we live across the street.
(We get lazy and think, "Well, maybe they're better now.
"  Nope, still sucks.

I agree with the other review.
SKIP this one and go to the one just up the road on Val Vista & Warner.
I have visited this one twice.
I should have learned my lesson when I got cold food the first time I went here.
I tried it again figuring maybe they just had a bad day as we all have them .. NOPE!
The food was just as crummy as it was the first time.. but this time it was burnt.
If I hadn't ordered it via drive thru, I would have sent it back.
My whole order was not acceptable & was thrown right into the rubbish, except the soda.
$7 wasted.
BOO.
Don't waste your seven bucks here!!

I have been coming to this location for over a year and while it does need improvements, it has never messed up my order and the orders are usually large for a family of four.
The wait sometimes is long and the general look of the building could use some sprucing but we have never had a problem here.
I feel like lately, they are trying to improve.
