I love the employees at this place.
The store is a little small and they get extremely busy.
Make an appointment for first thing in the morning in the middle of the week if your work schedule allows it.

No one will ever hold a candle to Discount Tire in my book.
My family have been loyal customers for over 20 years and will NEVER go anywhere else.
Good, honest, quick service.
Clean waiting room, nice technicians, lots of choices and no pushing to buy the most expensive tires.
I wish all businesses ran like this one.
And it is a local AZ company.

Booked appointment online waste of time.
Edgar the little salesman that helped was a big..... Oh excuse me little jerk!!!
Will never go to that location.
They act like they want to help but they just want your money and commission.
