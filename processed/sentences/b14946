I have purchased and sold gold and silver at B J's .
Both buying and selling was very easy.
They take the time to educate and explain the items I were selling .
After research I found the prices are very fair.
I have found some very desirable investment coins there and every transaction has been easy..
I also like the limits on the amount of customers allowed in at any one time and being Buzzd in and out make the transactions more secure.
I am and will be a repeat customer for years to come...

I am in love with this place.
BJ is extremely knowledgable and the staff is very friendly and helpful.
