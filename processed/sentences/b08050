Just brought my pup Roi to get neutered.
The staff was pretty good, they treated my dog with care and I think they did everything pretty quickly, drop off at 7:30am and pick up at 3:00.
They did kinda try to upsell a bunch of stuff that kinda sounds like your dog is going to die if you don't but that's just the way it goes now-a-days.
The Vet himself was kinda dry and a little short with words, but I didn't have many questions, the vet techs were very friendly and informative.
My cat is due for a checkup soon so I may be using their services again shortly, because I was please with my visit, and Roi has been doing great since the surgery, healed quickly and never winced in pain.

DON'T GO HERE!
My Parents Shih Poos had puppies and one of them had caught a cold.
We took him in and got him treated and well checked and the Vet said he was healthy otherwise.
BUT THEN A family had come over to adopt the SAME puppy.
They asked us where a good Vet  was and we recommended Bell Ridge, only to have the puppy returned and the money refunded along with a note from the SAME Veterinarian with a list of defects!
This puppy is just fine!
DON'T GO HERE!
