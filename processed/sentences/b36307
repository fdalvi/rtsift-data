I hate to say it, but I liked this place better than Ned's crazy sub.
I have been going to Ned's since I was a little kid.

This place was filthy!
Food prep area, walls, floors, worst off- the ice tea container.
GROSS

Steves crazy subs is a DIVE but it has amazing subs, the best in az.
I suggest take out because this place is filthy.
