As for a chain restaurant this one is superior as for the service, cleanliness and food are top notch.
Very friendly service.

Gave one star because I had to give something, don't let Bianca take your order because she doesn't know the menu.
I had to take my food back 3 times before they got it right.

Worst place ever!
I did not stop in fast food places in ages.
Decided to use restroom after shopping & get quesadilla .
Girl was cleaning floor then smashed her nose , cleaned with her pants, then decided to take order.....
I asked her to wash her hands first.
She said Oh yeah, & went to restroom .
Later took my order, just one quesadilla ....
I had to wait it for 11-12 minutes.... Really?
Fast food?????
Easier to stop in restaurant !
Place is sooooo dirty!
Trash over filled ....
I thru away quesadilla but left just a coke to drink......
Yucky!!!
