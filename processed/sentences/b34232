I've taken my vehicles here before but this time, it made me change my mind about this place.
The staff appearance made me want to stand outside and observe while they work on it.
I'm not discriminating at all but the techs were all tattoo covered younger guys.
I believe staff appearance needs to be professional and I did not see that.
The main reason I am writing this is because I noticed that my car was leaking oil from the oil pan plug when I got home.
The plug was not even snug.
I was able to loosen the plug very easy with my fingers.
I would only bring my vehicles here because it was close to my place.
If you do take your car there, make sure you observe while they work on it and make sure that they tighten everything correctly.

They take good care of me and my car every visit.
You don't normally think of mechanics and friendly people but these guys are...every time.
Brought 2 cars in and they cut me an extra discount.
Could work on making the accommodations in the lobby more hospitable.
It was pretty hot in here, stale air.
Turn on the air guys!

Wow, when did an oil change to $75?
I don't care what kind of oil you use!
I was a procrastinator, but I will never be back!
