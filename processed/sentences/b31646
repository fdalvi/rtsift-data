Finally got to check out the new location and it's alright.
I do love how bright it is and the quick change rooms are a great idea.
I love the new fitting rooms as well they are very spacious and layed out better then the previous location.
Service was alright, about the same as the old location, which makes sense since I'm sure the staff just moved.
Sales don't seem as good though.
Old Navy has always been the go to for grabbing a fabulous deal.
They had the clearance area stocked with things marked down by $2, that's not a clearance sale if you ask me!
The sales in the rest of the store were a bit better but not much.
I still prefer the Frank Lloyd Wright location.

I'm not super impressed with Old Navy's new location and it seems a lot smaller to me.
It is a bit brighter, which is nice, and the main things they've changed are the dressing rooms and the checkout set up.
It's a lot nicer to have one counter that everyone stands in the same line for that way it's faster and you don't have to play the whole guessing game of line racing.
I like shopping at Old Navy so I guess I'll just have to get used to it!

I just realized my kid is becoming Old Navy poster child.
As long as mom can score some bargains, that's ok.
I started shopping at Old Navy just recently.
It is one of those stores you know exist, but you never get inside.
And I'm glad I did.
There is always something on sale, either it's adult jeans for $15 or kid's winter jackets for $20.
For boy that will grow out of it in a few months, I really don't want to spend more.
I think there is enough selection for adults too.
Maybe it's not a greatest quality, but it holds good after dryer and it's affordable, no brainer there.
This specific location is not the largest, but it has enough to choose from.
It is bright and spacious, what else do you need
