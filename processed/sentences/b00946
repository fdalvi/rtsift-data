I stopped by this store on my way to an appointment.
I really like these stores.
I ended up with two pairs of pants, 3 blouses, a coat and some lacy stockings.
Sonya was very helpful and the selection was great.
I usually shop at the Kierland one, but I was in this part of town, so I am glad I stopped by.
