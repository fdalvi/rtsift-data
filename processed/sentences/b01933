Ahwatukee Carpets is a wonderful shop with a huge selection of flooring, kitchen cabinets and counter tops, custom area rugs and more.
It's a locally-owned family operation that has served the East Valley for many years and it has remained in business because you can get the same products as you can at the big box stores for the same or lower prices -- plus you get personal attention!
The owner, Traci, is great at helping you pick out the best products for your home and she even comes out to measure your house herself.
Seriously.
We've known Traci for years and she not only runs a great business she's also an active member of the community.
If you are thinking of getting new carpet, tile or wood flooring, kitchen cabinets or counter tops, or even a custom area rug you should definitely stop by the Ahwatukee Carpets showroom.

Ahwatukee Carpet is much more than carpet, it is a complete design center.
Traci will give you great guidance to update your home or office.
She is also an outstanding leader in our community.
Thanks Traci!

Quality business, great people from owner, manager and installers.
Would use again and recommend them to anyone who is looking for home design products.
