Scheduled me and my two kids.
Appt at 9 am.
Didn't see the first of us until 10am.
Didn't let me escort my daughter (teen) but did let me escort my son (at about 10:30am).
They were disorganized and behind schedule.
My daughter said the doctor/dentist wasn't personable-- didn't explain things to her.
She said the hygienist was nice though.
Same dentist seemed like he wanted to get my son in for more xrays, son might be missing an adult tooth underneath baby molar.
But then the assistant took us back after he left and did full pano xray.
He was not missing that tooth.
Weird that the dentist wasn't willing to do it right then-- wanted us to make another appt.
They did fluoride treatment on my daughter without asking me, which was $17.
Which I paid, but they should have asked first, I would have said yes-- principle though.
I never got seen, they ran out of time for me, because we had to leave by noon.
Took 2.5 hours to see 2 out of 3 of us.
Weren't very friendly.
And to boot, I found out they use Dr Jeffrey Kootman for their surgeon on Thursdays-- he did extracted my wisdom teeth years ago and I would NEVER let him touch my kids or myself EVER again.
Very disappointed.
Don't get Total Dental insurance-- hard to find a good dentist and this is an example of what you get!

Very incompetent.
Would not recommend to any friend or family member.

This place was not clean, unorganized and unprofessional.
The surgeon didn't even wash his hands before looking in my mouth and he still had ink in his hands which means he didn't wash them before coming I to the room!
He even was looking at the wrong X-ray for my mouth because I didn't even get X-rays in that office.
The staff was unprofessional and did not have good communication with each other.
I went there because my previous surgeon was not covered by my insurance for the procedure I needed otherwise I would have stayed with him!!!
I WOULD NOT recommend this place to anyone unless they are absolutely desperate.
