When I got pregnant, I didn't even search for any doctors, I just automatically picked Dr. Gex.
He delivered my nephew 5 months prior, and my sister told me how much she loved the staff.
I'm glad I trusted my sister's word.
The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable.
Dr. Gex is quite possibly my favorite doctor in the world.
He always has a smile and a few jokes.
He and his staff make you feel at home with them.
When progress on my labor stalled and we had to do a c-section, Dr. Gex asked me many times how I was doing, and if I was okay.
It's that kind of compassion that makes him a great doctor... Not to mention my scar is straight and tiny!
We love Gex Women's Care!

Dr. Gex was recommended to me by 6 friends and family, he definitely lived up to my expectations.
During My whole pregnancy he was soothing and caring he takes the time to listen and gives his honest opinions and not pushing them on you like others.
his office staff is amazing.
Once I was admitted into the hospital it's such a relief seeing your Doctor calm and collective he just made the whole experience easy breezy.
Gex has to be one of the best in the business, despite him being a saints fan!
Haha :)
