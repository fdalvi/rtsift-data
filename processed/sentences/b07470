Presto Auto Title Loans are a joke !
They advertise one thing on TV yet when you go through the process everything is not as advertised.
If you want a quick and legit title loan do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.

I will never get a title loan from any other location in town!
I needed some emergency cash for some home repairs.
I don't have much established credit at all so getting financed for any loan from a bank is such a chore.
I went into Presto, they were so nice, helpful, and it didn't take much more than 30 mins to complete the whole process.
I got exactly what i needed with no issues!

As someone who is on SSi disability This company Not only gave me a loan but are reporting the on time payments to the credit bureau's helping me and others build our credit.
This place ttreats you with respect and courtesy when your in a bind.
