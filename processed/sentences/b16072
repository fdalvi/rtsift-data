This is one of three stations I usually use to fill up for gas.
I only use Chevron Gas whenever possible.
It is just a habit.
The price here for gas is usually +-$0.05 within the other stations I frequent.
What I like about this station is the ease of ingress and egress.
It is very easy to access from I-215 and it is very easy to get back on the I-215 as well.
The convenience store has what I need when I'm in a hurry and is always clean with friendly employees.
One last thing is the drive through automatic car wash here.
It is open 24 hours a day and is also brush-less with no track.
This is good as I used to drive my lowered car through here and I do not like anything but hand washed by me, myself and I.
The brush-less car wash is a good alternative between washings, however!

Got the $9 wash.
Unfortunately it was kind of a shitty wash.
I still had lots of bugs stuck in my lower front bumper.
My lights were also spotty with dirt.
Windshield was ok, not great.
If it wasn't so close to my house I wouldn't come back.
As is, I'm definitely on the lookout for something better.

Gas station.
Right off 215 and Town Center.
Nothing too special.

There are gas stations within a few miles of this particular location with cheaper prices.

Typical of this chain.
Very dirty.
They never seem to clean their facilities.

This Terrible's is pretty close to my house.
I stop there for beer on my way home.
Used the car wash one time, I felt I payed way too much, for a horrible car wash.   Never pumped gas there, because it's higher in price than most gas stations in my area.
The convenience store has a good selection of products, at a decent price.
The beer cavern is great, because it's the coldest beer, in miles.
It's not the easiest parking lot to get in and out of.
It's usually crowded, and parking spots are hard to find.
The employees are pretty much what you can expect from Minimum Wage Employees.
I will still go there, as long as the price is right.
