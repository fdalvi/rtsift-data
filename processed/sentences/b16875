What can I say it's 7-11!
I can say that we were going to Kaze Sushi  and they were not open for a couple hours and we were hungry so we got some snacks .
Say what you will but the hot dogs and the fried cheese wraps, whatever they are we're good.
The girl working here was really nice, she had excellent customer service!
I found myself thinking, this girl needs to be at a higher paying job, with her customer skills!!!!
But, it was clean and she was very nice!!!!
Cheap eats and great Customer Service!

There is only one reason to give an otherwise-mediocre convenience store a review.
And that reason is Slurpees.
Coming from a state that doesn't have 7-11s,, you had to pay for a $10 movie ticket, then shell out about $5, to get Icees- and that was as close as you could get to a Slurpee.
This convenience store is conveniently located and gets multiple visits from me.
On good days, I'll celebrate with a Slurpee.
On bad days, I'll seek one out as comfort food.
Needless to say, the convenience has made my frequent Slurpee habit border on addiction.
BF gets lucky when I stop here, and I'll often grab him some sunflower seeds, beer, or a treat from the pastry case for something sweet.
Downside to this location is that they inconsistently stock some of their foods and it's always hit or miss whether or not they'll have the whole seeds in stock without having to grab some bizarre flavor like dill pickle.
Staff here are friendly in a way that you don't usually see in a convenience store- they'll make conversation and remember you after a few visits, unlike cashiers I'm used to getting who look like they hate their lives and wish they were anywhere but work.
