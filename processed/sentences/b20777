If the food from this nice, upmarket deli was labelled like in Alice in Wonderland, the labels would say things like "Eat me- I'm very middle class you know!
" The fare is varied and exotic: the first time I went I had a delicious butternut squash and coconut soup, then a tomato-olive-corriander-and-homemade-hummus sandwich; on Day 2 I opted for Jerusalem artichoke soup, followed by a sandwich of stilton, on walnut bread, and with a fig chutney.
Spiffing!
The soup is lovely and hot - in every sense of the word.
The meal-deal is also very affordable.
Â£4.25 for a lunch of this quality is a bargain.
I work right across the street, so I'll be ordering lunch from here, like, every day.

I'm updating my review of Appetite to five stars because, frankly, having tried other places in the area, it really is exceptional.
Due to an office move, I'm not there as often as I'd like.
I miss the amazing soups and sandwiches, and I'm trying to come up with inventive reasons for taking a two-hour lunch break in order to satisfy my addict-like needs.
So while I can't go, you should.
You won't be disappointed.
