Very nice place.
Looks like some construction in the front but that's a cover for their outdoors dining area which is surprisingly very clean and comfortable looking.
inside is also really clean.
Small bar area with a few different types of liquor, Korean place so obviously a big ass bottle of Crown Royal, Respect, a bottle of jack (WTF?!
), bottle of Vodka, and a bottle of Tanqueray 10, as well as assorted Soju, flavored Soju and beers.
Omg i cant remember the last time i've had an OB...  Food is awesome, but this place is more of a Korean watering hole / hangout spot / watering hole.
VERY friendly people  Will go again for sure, just need a designated driver next time I wanna relive my glory days of 300 dollars worth of soju shots in Korea   Update It's been a month since my last visit.
Every now and then i have a huge craving for a Kim Chi stew and an OB.
Gotta find new friends all they wanna eat is jack in the box

Great place to eat away from the strip - go there early for some good food and quiet place to chat with friends, stay later and you'll get all the clubbing locals.
Food is good, I just wished I didn't eat so much at the buffet, by the time I was there could really order only two dishes.
Very cute waitress there.

re open!!!
for the love of something very loveable reopen or at least tell me where to find the head chef!!!
been months since i had a decent pot of military stew!!
