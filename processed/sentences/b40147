Great local small business.
Very helpful and informative.
And great idea...consigning my previous wedding set!

I met Carl at the Women's Expo last year and finally made my way over to the store a few weeks ago.
I was helping my brother "recycle" an engagement ring from a few years ago.
It's hard to find a jeweler you can trust to be fair and give you the best options for your situation.
Carl spent so much time laying out the options and finally helped us to find a new mounting for an already gorgeous diamond.
The ring came out beautifully and she was thrilled to say YES!!!
All of the staff were so friendly and accommodating.
It was a great experience very professional, no pressure and really great prices!
For anyone looking for a new ring or to make better use of old jewelry I would highly recommend the Diamond Consignment Store!

Carl & Babara of The Diamond Consignment Store in Scottsdale give such wonderful customer service!
I will ONLY buy my jewelry through them for years to come.
I recommend them HiGHLY!
You will be very pleased with their service, their pricing & especially their jewelry they have in store or can find for you.
Don't bother looking elsewhere, Carl will find it for you at a price you can afford.
