Never again... Heard it was good but got there none of the barbers looked close to being a barber messed up my cut..had to go buy my own machine n fix it... Don't knoe if this is how they get down in Vegas but not my style should of just waited a extra hour for my barber to open in Kali

All the barbers are like there shirts tight.
They all give good fades and blowouts.
They like to clown and eat alot.
They did my design by hand not with a stencil.
On Fridays and Saturdays the wait can get long.
On Tuesdays appointments aren't even necessary, you could get in and out.
This is one of the best barber shops I have ever been to.

I like this place.
I drive all the way from the southwest side of town just to get my cut here.
Ralph, Paul, Lee, Kyle and Dan are always a trip.
Become a regular and join in the bullshittery in this place.
These fatboys make for a fun time and they can all cut.
Dan's the man.
Paul is cool.
Kyle aims to please the trendy and Ralph is way underrated.
Been a regular for nearly 4 years and I gotta tell ya,  I've seen this place get renovated and I'm stoked for the success of this shop.
Can't find a better barbershop around with such affordable prices.

By far the best shop in Vegas!!!!
They offer pick up and drop off services...
Phenomenal cuts!
Great time!
Good People!!
