New store nicer lay out but the back corner and aisle near the coolers going toward the pharmacy is kinda wonky.
The cosmetic area is very nice and right up front right when you walk in.
Love the drive-thru pharmacy!

This is a fairly new store here in the valley and I must say it is very impressive.
Good customer service.....very clean....and they seem to always have some sort of sale going on.
The pharmacy department is very good and the staff is extremely friendly.
If your in a hurry they do have a drive thru for the pharmacy which makes getting what you need very nice.
I mean most CVS stores are pretty much the same.....however because this one is so new and near a major intersection I think it will truly stand out.
I will keep you all posted on it's progress as time goes alone....because I think that will tell the true story about this locale going forward.
Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!

Filthy.
From the parking lot to the restrooms.

This is the newest CVS store that I've been to as I don't  usually come to this neighborhood to shop.
The store is in the then- Bashas' grocery store.
The store is very bright and have good selections.
I was just trying my luck for a special soap I usually get at Target, I was so shocked to see it and the price is cheaper too.
Definitely coming back here again for that specific soap.

I have the best service there!
Especially love Mary, she's always helpful, smiling, helps when there are problems, remembers me when I pull up!
And she gives my dog Lucky a dog biscuit when he's with me too!
