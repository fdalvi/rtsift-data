Good lunch.
Supreme Sandwich or a Bowl of Chili are always rocken!!
Breakfast on the other hand go with the Croissant Sandwich.

OK.
So I've only had a toasted everything bagel with cream cheese.
I'm not a New Yorker.
I'm not a bagel expert.
I know the yelp debate on this culinary disc can get more heated than a black leather seat in Phoenix in July.
But each time, it's perfect.
Cream cheese is spread evenly on the bagel.
Bagel is cut in half and wrapped in white paper.
I hate the places that serve you cream cheese in a little squeeze packet.
UGH!
I never get all the cream cheese out and end up cutting it open and licking it out.
Like the lady in the commercial squeezing ketchup packets at home into her ketchup bottle to save money.
The gentleman behind the counter is friendly and remembers my name even when I don't.
The menu has pastries, hot breakfast and hot lunches.
You can also grab fruit, yogurt and Snapple.
There's plenty of reading material and the decor is simple yet comfortable.
It's tucked away at City Square Plaza (gee, thus the name)...next to the Light (De)Railed Cafe.
Yep.
It's 86'd.
Thanks City Square Cafe...for allowing me to make a pit stop on my way to work.
Those three blocks can be grueling in the summer and it's refreshing to cool down a bit before walking 200 yards to my job.

Always friendly and the food is really good.

5 stars for the value at this joint.
50 things under 7$ several under 5$.
Breakfast here rules.
If your on a budget this is the spot, and the food's good either way.

Great place to get a bite whether you are on your lunch time or just want to get some good food at a decent price!
I have been to this place since 2010 and have never been disappointed!
There are daily specials displayed on an outside board and the staff is very friendly.
Jim, the owner, is usually working at the joint and will flash a smile and chat you up a bit.
It is amazing to see an owner that is very involved and remembers just about every customers name that walks through the door.
Personally, the breakfast burrito is my favorite and will leave you full!
Can't go wrong with this joint!

I was at a training session across the street and stopped in for lunch.
The owner was serving and it was great.

I had the club sandwich.
The meat portion was very generous.
And the side of cottage cheese had a bit of tang that was to my liking.
The atmosphere was comfy and there's 2tvs with sports playing.
