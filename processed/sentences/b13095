OK, so this Gilbert Red Brick Pizza isn't that much different than the other Gilbert Red Brick Pizza.
BUT, one thing different is, I never tried the gelato at the other one.
Big mistake!
Red Brick Pizza's gelato is made in the store fresh every day.
They rotate between 50 flavors, offering 12 at a time.
I thought the pizza was a little shy on the sauce and the store wasn't as clean as the one I usually go to, but it's hard to complain when the gelato's this good!

For cheap and fast pizza this place is good.
I go every once in a while to get a pizza.
Seriously, its chain and it tastes like one.
Go if you want some fast cheap pizza, don't expect Grimaldi's or anything.

It really is good for the money.
They have great salads too.
Very fresh.
Kids loved this pizza too.

this pizza is so so.
i get pizza there for my husband and son.
they seem to like it and they have a coupon card.
so every pizza you order you get some $ off.
we paid $2.00 tonight for our pizza.
great deal.

Took my kids there everything came out quick and we ate it all.
Kids wanna go back.
