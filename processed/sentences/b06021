They really made me happy when we got our flu shot for free.
Thats because we get ours on the military base for free.
So they didn't charge us.
So they will see me every year, as long as there offering it to me for free.

Used to shop this CVS almost everyday when I lived just a couple of footsteps away.
The supervisor that was there, Lisa, was really cool and like a friend.
Not certain she is still there.
The rest of the staff is pretty cool too.
Store is always clean and neat and they typically have some of the best fire sales outside of grocery stores and liquor stores.
When I lived out here two years ago, they did have a reputation of hiring some seedy folks.
Had one, I'm pretty certain, steal my debit card number and my niece and sister both told stories of checkers offering you everything you were buying for free if you'd slip them a $20 spot.
Outside of that, I like the honest employees and the convenience of being of walking distance when I lived out here.

I work by this cvs and I shop here daily.
Probably for the last 4 years.
The staff is always friendly and the store is always stocked with the item I need.
The only thing I dont like is that the prices are kinda high....the price of fast shopping.
Still never the less its a nice place and always clean.
The employees come and go like any job but the staff is always friendly.

Went to the drive-thru pharmacy pick-up and the pharmacist, Ron Horvath, was a complete jerk.
I waited for 10 minutes after his rude and dismissive attitude over the intercom system.
He needs to be taught some customer service skills.
