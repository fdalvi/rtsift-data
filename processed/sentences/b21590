Really fun shoes, beautiful store & a friendly clerk.
If only the shoes cost hundreds instead of thousands...

I love this store!
My travel and shopping companion and I must stop here every time we are in Vegas.
They carry hard-to-find designers and the shoes are just awesome!
Fun, funky, unique, and beautiful are some words I would use to describe the shoes at this store.
The sales associates are some of the best I've encountered, if not the best: very helpful and friendly, not at all pushy, and they don't put any pressure on you or make you feel bad if you decide not to get anything.
Thanks for making our shopping experience a great one each time!
