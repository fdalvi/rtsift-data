The staff is incredibly helpful and they know customer service.
I will gladly go into Safeway (& go out of my way in general) to use this Wells Fargo as opposed to others.
Joey is very professional and personable, as well as the rest of the employees.

I know I can't always expect good service from the big banks but this branch was fast, courteous and informative with a very complex banking situation.
They even waived some fees to get money sent out.
Thanks

Very very friendly, happy to help, and fast service.
Will make this location my go to.
