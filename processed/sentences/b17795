Run by one guy (Dale).
We've lived here since 8/2001 and have had a variety of vehicles - he's done the tint on all of them.
He does a great job, takes pride in his work, and is very reliable.

We have utilized Dale for all of our tinting in our home and our family vehicles.
Very relible while providing quality work at a fair price.
Strongly recommend!
