We had a great experience at Escape Eagles.
The bikes were in excellent condition, the staff were friendly, everything was positive.
Also, discounts for firefighters!

The entire team at Escape Eagles were very helpful and accommodating.
Their motorcycles were in great condition.
Most all of the choices were 2012 models.
They offer a military discount and everything was included.
Insurance, goggles, helmet, and gloves.
I will definitely return here.

Best part of our trip to Vegas was renting a Honda Goldwing from these guys.
Easy renting.
Smooth process.
Price for us for 24 hrs was $170 plus tax.
Helments and gloves provided.
We did our own GPS.
They are open daily.
When we returned the bike there wa a sign to call a # as they had stepped out.
Ordered our own cab only for the guy to roll up and offer to call a company he's aligned with for cab business as it's too hard to get anyone to come out there.
Goldwing was just like ours at home.
Carefully taken care of and it was a great experience.
DEFINITELY would do it again.
Highlight of our trip.

Absolutely top notch, THE place to rent a motorcycle in Vegas!.
They have a good selection of late-model Harleys and GoldWings; I rented their Fatboy for a multiday trek across NV, AZ and UT.
Viktor and his staff were friendly, knowledgeable and accessible and worked with me to schedule the rental for my convenience.
They stored my luggage, filled my water bottles and called me a cab to the airport at the end.
The shop is immaculate and the bikes are in excellent condition, obviously well maintained and shiny as can be.
Will definitely rent with Escape Eagles again next time I'm in the area.
