This library has recently been renovated.
The mural outside has been repainted too.
There is a large Libraries 4 youth section with plasma screen and games consols.
At the back is a really nice kids section.
there are of course, books, magazines and public acess computers.
The library staff are great and they run books for babies, library link snd other events on a regular basis.
Its a great pity that they are only open part-time.

There are dotted around Edinburgh a number of good libraries that are worth a visit for those with book reading tendancies.
This, however, is not one of them.
I've been here and one of my friends has also been here and we both agree that unless you live right next door then coming here is a waste of a trip.
Not a great library.

This is definitely not one of the most extensive libraries in Edinburgh by any stretch of the imagination, but it does serve a good local purpose for the locals in the area with internet access and a range, although very limited, of books.
The library is where members of the area come together on Monday's to discuss their book of the week, and in this respect the library has a great civic duty to the area.
But the amount of books available really is quite pitiful and I think that the council really do need to think about upgrading the library to ensure that the people in the area get a library that they can be proud of.
As Robert says, it isn't worth a visit if there is another library near you.
