Last year we purchased a $4,000 special order sectional from the Comfort Shoppe.
We experienced quality issues and the same horrible customer service that Jennifer P. describes.
If you are looking for top quality merchandise and hoping to do business with people who care about you and your business, we recommend that you avoid shopping at the Comfort Shoppe.

I was a huge fan of the Comfort Shoppe, I ordered many things there over the last 5+ years and recommended it to many.
But, since the new owners have taken over, I have much to complain about.
It has taken me almost 6 months to receive something that was supposed to take 10 weeks.
I finally just cancelled my order, as I found it somewhere else.
What really got me was how the new manager didn't even seem to care or save my business.
Very disappointing and sad that they handled it this way.

This is the worst group we have encountered.
Originally our furniture was to take six weeks for delivery.
We are on week sixteen and still no furniture.
The are poor communicators and we found that it was hard to believe anything they told us.
They have no explanation for delays and they were very reluctant to have any open communication.
I would stay away.
Our hope is our new furniture will last a long time, because of the hassle of working with them.
I would stay away from them and I would not recommend buying a throw pillow for a couch from these guys.
