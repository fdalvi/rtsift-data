Food: 3 stars.
My 'naked' grilled veggie burrito tasted fresh and flavorful, but 'grilled veggies' was limited to zucchini and squash.
Also the assembly line system makes for a very uneven burrito.
My veggies and beans disappeared under huge scoops of guacamole and cheese.
The selection of salsas, however, is great and is sure to satisfy everyone.
Staff: 2 stars.
Unfriendly and are obviously just there to get the job done.
Atmosphere: 3 stars.
Standard fast food setting.
Lots of windows.
Attracts a usual business and school crowd, and gets very busy at lunch time.
Price: 2 stars.
Expensive for a simple fast food burrito!
I could go to a sit down Mexican restaurant and get something much better for about the same price.

It sort of reminds me of a subway version of mexican food but that said : it is no Taco Bell.
I've always been a huge fan of their grilled veggie burritos , bean burritos and taco salads.
The ingredients are amazing and I know some people complained about the beans but gosh - they're the best part!
I love that hot salsa-- pour it on!

Clean, good food.
Friendly service.

I would have given this Qdoba 4 stars because the food,  like all Qdobas, is good enough, fresh and consistent.
However, I have given it 3 stars due to the fact that when I went into the bathroom to change my son's diaper there was no changing station.
Seriously?
I would understand if this were a fine dining establishment but it's Qdoba.
Kids go to Qdoba all the time, they have a kid's menu for goodness sake.normally I would just put his changing mat on the floor and change hon there but the floor was grimey too, yuck!
At the end of the day it's pretty expected for a fast-food place like Qdoba to have changing facilities for infants.
How irritating!
