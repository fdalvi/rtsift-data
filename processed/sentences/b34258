Thanks for straightening me out!
Literally :)

in and out.
Very easy but no insurance taken.

Ever since going to the Joint I feel much better.
The staff is friendly.
I'm in and out quickly.
I've recommended the joint to many people.

Emeliah gives this place 5 stars.
She's so sweet, and remembers your name after one visit.
She even remembers the previous stories you shared from 3 months ago.
She's very caring and really strong.

Dr. Emeliah Hanson is one of the best chiropractors I have ever used!
she is excellent using low force technique and has helped me dramatically after several injuries.
I highly recommend you take the time to go visit "The Joint"!

Dr. Emeliah Hanson is incredible!
We found her a couple of years ago when my back problems began and I'm soooo thankful that we did!
I'm now a regular and would recommend her to absolutely anyone!
Caring, considerate, and great at what she does - I just really can't say enough about Emeliah and what she's done to help me regain my mobility.
