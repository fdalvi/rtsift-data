$114 for a dozen Valentines day roses with thorns still on and a balloon!!
Enough said.

Great flowers and people.
The store is very nice as well.
I decided to get my wife flowers celebrating her promotion on my way to work and a beautiful arrangement was put together in no time.
Thank you for a great job.

After many trials and tribulations using national flower chains to send floral gifts to my mom in AZ ( I'm in IL) I thought I would take a chance with a local establishment.
I ordered on line for Mothers Day and just last week.
Both experiences were very easy for me as the purchaser.
The web site is easy to navigate through and confirmation is received when the order is placed.
My mom has enjoyed the beautiful arrangements.
They are exactly what I ordered and have lasted a long time.
Best of all, my request for the delivery man to be patient and wait for her to get to the door has been noted and followed.
He has been very pleasant and kind.
Thank you Watsons for helping a far away daughter make sure her mom is going to get the right flowers on the requested day!
Your product and service has been fantastic!
