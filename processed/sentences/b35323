I came to Rolf Therapy works  along the way in my quest to cure my scoliosis.
Although I knew in the back of my mind that I'd had it since childhood, I only started to address it at the age of fifty-three.
Now, after about three years, my healing is well along.
My treatment included chiropractic, massage, and naturopathic, and most recently, Rolfing from Roberto Paredes of Rolf Therapy Works.
To make the most of all the bodywork (none of which has been covered by insurance, but oh well), I have been taking yoga, tai chi, and qi gong classes.
This has been an amazing experience, because along with healing my posture, I have also straightened out my life.
Many thanks to Roberto Paredes for the supportive yoga and tai chi classes, and Rolfing.

Roberto provided me not only with 10 Rolf sessions of Structural Integration, but also coupled the treatments with customized guidance on life style modifications including regular exercise, nutrition and body awareness.
Another great benefit of specific soft tissue work on my arms was that Roberto eliminated painful flare ups from repetitive typing stress and I avoided carpal tunnel surgery unlike many of my colleagues at work who opted for the operations.
