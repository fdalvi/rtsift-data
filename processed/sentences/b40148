Do not try to sell to this guy.
Here is his deal.
He sends his fiance (I have no issue with her as she seemed professional) out to your house with some insulting low-ball offer.
I gracefully declined the offer and told her I did not appreciate the offer and we parted ways as friends.
Not even FIVE minutes later I get a simple text from Matt saying "GO FUCK YOURSELF.
" Horrible "business man" that should not be trusted in your home.
PS - the 4/30 review is by his fiance.
Sad that he had to have her right a positive review for him.

Great experience!
Found a couch online and they delivered it to me THAT DAY!
Genuinely friendly and honest people, something that seems to be lost these days.
It was a seamless, hassle free transaction and I absolutely love my new couch!
Just like new for a fraction of the cost.
I would highly recommend Fresh Couch to anyone!

I bought a couch from 'Fresh Couch' a couple of weeks ago.
And as I'm sitting here on it, I must say...  it was well worth it!
The fresh couch people were easy to deal with, and I was especially pleased with how quickly they delivered it to my place.
I'm happy that I decided to buy from them, and I would do it again.
