GREAT experience.
Very quick, and clean.
I had my a/c recharged here and they made sure everything was in tip-top shape before I went back to the road.
They were incredibly helpful especially in this soon-to-become HOT Las Vegas!
Everyone is very friendly and this is by far the CLEANEST Facility I have ever been too.
They care, do things very well, and at an incredibly affordable price.
I would recommend this place to anybody!

Very Happy I finally found an honest mechanic in Las Vegas!
I just got my front brakes done and they only charged me $35 for labor!!
Ted Wiens quoted me over $500 to do just my front axle for parts+labor.
So I bought my own parts at autozone and took them to MWM.
All in all I paid $145, which I believe is reasonable.
I've done my own brakes on two different vehicles in the past and I know that it is not overly complicated, but you just need the right tools and work space.
So I know the rates MWM charged me are very very fair!
The facilities were clean and professional and so was the staff.
I immediately felt as though I was dealing with honest men.
He didn't try to upsell me on needless services.
I asked him if I needed the brake fluid changed yet and he told me no.
It is fine.
(Again Ted Wiens told me it was very dirty and wanted $90 for that as well.
)  If you're tired of getting ripped off for maintenance and repairs I highly HIGHLY recommend MWM auto.
As long as I live in Las Vegas, they will get ALL of my business anytime my truck needs servicing.

I went to get my oil changed here and they were able to fit me in without an appointment.
Nice facility and there wasn't any upselling on unnecessary services.
