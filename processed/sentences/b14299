Good food, good prices, and good service.
Nothing too "Extreme" about Extreme Pita, except maybe the welcome alternative to a burger and fries.
It also has an over-lit, generic, fast-food decor which inhibits digestion.

I have to agree with Michael C, there's nothing extreme here.
The food was A-OK and better than McWendyKing's.
I did find the service and presentation fit the mold of other fast food joints and that's not a good thing.
One of the guys behind the counter was a persistent up-seller which quickly became annoying.

I hang out in this complex a lot (at Gold Bar) and finally broke down and ate here recently.
Here's my thoughts on the whole place.
Extreme Pita isn't bad.
It's just not great.
I mean, theres a decent menu, prices are okay, service is mediocre.
But, something about it feels like a subway with pitas.
I got the gyro pita, and it was fine, but it just isnt anything that I would crave/miss food wise.
Like Micheal C said, it has an overlit, generic fast food decor feeling to it.
I think he said it best in his review of this place, and pretty much covered how I feel about Extreme Pita.
Go Micheal C!
