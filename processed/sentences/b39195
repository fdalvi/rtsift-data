My appt was for 1045.. its now 1121 and still waiting on lobby..uuggh

Office staff is very friendly.
I arrived early for my daughter's appt.
and I expected to wait which was no big deal since I've worked in healthcare for 10+years and know how it can go, but they got my daughter in really quick.
The doctor was extremely nice and explained everything to my daughter where she could understand it.
It was also very easy to get an appt as well!

I have been going to Daniel Taheri for over a year now and my face has cleared up alot!
This doctor is extremely nice and he knows his stuff!
Every appointment has been on time and the ladies at the front desk are extremely nice!
They always give free samples and truely care about their customers!
I highly recommend this dermatologist!

This is my 4th or 5th attempt to find a dermatologist in Las Vegas.
I cannot always just go to the one I see in San Diego.
The staff is very nice.
The office is clean and quiet.
The problem was I waited 2 hours for 5 minutes of a PA's time.
He was nice.
However he spoke so fast, and it appeared he could not wait to move on to the next patient.
They did not know my history nor really cared when I told them.
He suggested a small procedure, then went into how much it would cost due to my deductible.
Between talking about money and the speed of the exam I am not comfortable having a procedure done here.
Would that be 5 minutes as well.
I am not going to a dermatologist for cosmetic procedures.
I go due to a serious condition.
Regardless of the reason for the visits all patients deserve more than 5 minutes.
I will stick to seeing my dr. in San Diego.
