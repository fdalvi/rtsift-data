Our lady did a great job with our medi and pedi, Kind of pricey about $30 but my gf lives down the street and I really needed one.
Its pretty much in the middle of no where but they did have a sonic's in the same plaza .. Hey, we don't have sonic's in LA!

I live right up the road so it's close for me.
Prices are not bad fill ins are 15 dollars.
Full sets are 25.
I think 30 for pink and white.
They do some good nail art.
I haven't had a problem yet and I have been going to them since 05/2010.

I always come here to get my eyebrows done.
Its very hard to find a good eyebrow place and someone you trust!
Love that its close to home and not wicked expensive for a simple request!
Im definitely a regular here.

I come here to get my eyebrows done with Amy she's Amazing and the only person who's ever done my eyebrows can't trust anyone else LOVE IT !!
