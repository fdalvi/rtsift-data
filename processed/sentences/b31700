As a first-time homebuyer, I was worried about the inspection process.
Toby took the time to explain everything to me and fielded all of my questions.
He provided a thorough and  clear inspection report with photographs.
He also made maintenance suggestions and showed me where electrical and water cutoffs were located.
Toby can be trusted to do a professional inspection.

We are really happy our Realtor has the contacts she does as we really enjoyed our inspection with Toby.
He was very thorough and patient and speaks from a place of experience.
He quickly identified areas and was able to speak about the options and alternatives available for mending or repairs.
Would do business again.
