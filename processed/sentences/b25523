Got a summer haircut yesterday.
Gal did a nice job, seemed interested in me and not just doing her job.
Happy with the haricut results and they keep a nice clean facility.
Tip - they have $2 off promos and a punchcard if you get 9 haircuts you get one free.

Worst haircut EVER!!!
One other haircut in my life I went back to get fixed but it was for minor trimming.
After this haircut from Supercuts I need a complete redo except that in the front my hair is so short there is nothing that can be done until it grows out.
Girl that cut my hair had no clue.
Started off with the clippers and it felt like she wasn't getting close enough, sure enough when I got home there are medium sized patches that are much longer than they should be.
On the top in the middle she left it way longer than towards the sides (but still on the top).
When I pointed this out she started going shorter, then shorter, then shorter still at one point groaning because she wasn't the results she was trying for.
I could go on....
So while the haircut was terrible... the worst part was that all her "tools" or whatever hairdressers call it were sitting on the counter in front of me and as I looked closer they were all filled with OTHER PEOPLES hair!!
This is just wrong and disgusting.
Supercuts blows and I will never go back.
From now on I will spend the extra few bucks and go to Sports Clips where they always pull out a new and CLEAN towel with clean clippers.

I have to say they gave me the worst haircut I have ever had.
I will never go there again.
