This is the best hardware store around.
It is not the largest.
It has lots of competition of big box stores.However we always return & shop at Ace for one special reason...And that is customer service.
The sales people are knowledgeable, approachable, friendly and will actually meet you at the front door and walk you through your shopping list.
It doesn't get better than that.
Your shopping time is substantially less.. it saves you from wandering aimlessly through aisle after aisle, and you leave with a smile.

Very helpful when I went to buy a faucet valve.
Guy there showed me exactly what I needed and checking around, it was a good deal too.

A REAL hardware store with employees who actually know what's what!!!
Such a refreshing change from the big-box stores who's employees have no idea what you're talking about.
