Friendly service, very helpful and reliable.
I had a problem with roof rats.
They came around blocked all the holes they could find with wire mesh and set bait traps around the house - plus they gave me plenty of advice.
Roof rats have gone from the house and they have been very reliable on their monthly visits.
Highly recommended

These guys are the best.
It all started when we had a roof rat in our attic.
They sealed up our house right away to prevent it from happening again and got that sucker!
My neighbors used them too and after setting up bait stations no rats for the last year!
We have been using them for over 4 years.
They come every month and check with me to see if I have had any problems.
They are very honest and fair in their pricing.
Plus they are a locally owned company.
It doesn't get any better than that.
If I ever have a problem they are on it.
