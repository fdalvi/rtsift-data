Wow, after taking a look at the parks website i feel like my review will be incomplete.
Well I'll couch it.
This morning I was looking for somewhere to walk around and the receptionist at my hotel said there was a park just a half mile down on McKellips.
I drove by it first, then on the return found it opposite of 1733 McKellips Road.
I got out and set off on the wide, well-maintained sidewalk.
It wasn't that early, but the park looked abandoned except for a park working spraying something with a hose and assorted homeless people.
I jogged around the lake once and went on my way, it was too manufactured I guess, and creepy that it was so abandoned.
Now I see that it is only 1 of 3 huge tracks that I was running on, and that actually the park extends from McKellips up to MacDowell.
I will go back to check out the whole span of the park, see if i can find any people.
All in all, I've experienced better.

Um not sure whyTF there is a low-star review.
Because it's fairly empty?
Weird.
I start out here for my bike rides up and down the green belt.
I've never encountered any vagrants, though some of the disc golfers have the homeless look going on.
A nice splash pad, lots of seating, and sometimes there are some teens (?
) practicing music in the park.
Minus one star as this place is packed on holidays and some evenings, and these fellow park-goers don't seem to understand (or care) that the multi-use path is not a good place to let your young children run free on.

A hidden gem.
There is a free mini water park here... bring the kids and play!
