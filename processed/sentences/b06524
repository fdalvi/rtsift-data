Things have gotten much better there since my initial 2010 review,  I had a taco there the other night that was as big as my head!
The bartender / owner has turned things around and made this a designation I prefer instead of avoid like 3 years ago.
Nice turnaround!

Stopped in after cross country skiing at Indian Lake for a beer and burger.
FANTASTIC bar burger and fries, done a perfect medium.
Bacardi and a cheeseburger / fries ran around $10.
The place is very clean, and friendly bartender.
We'll definitely stop back again !

The Whip rocks!
Yes, the most recent owners have really improved the quality of the food and maintenance of the bar and restaurant.
The food is excellent.
Don't get me wrong, this is still a dive.
This is not a 4 star restaurant so don't expect that type of food.
However, it is not a redneck or biker bar either.
The Friday night fish fry is worth the trip.
The breading is light and the fish is flavorful.
The burgers are also very good, and the service is excellent.
The atmosphere is simple but clean.
On a weekend night all the locals gather to drink and eat.
It parallels a German pub being the social center of the area.
You can see 3-4 generations of the same family at the Whip at the same time.
So if you want to see the real Wisconsin rural pub seen, stop by for a beer and a tasty meal.
You won't be disappointed.
