I needed to stop at the ATM last night.
This is not inside the Lucky Center but rather along Trop.
It was easy in and out and I was on my way quickly.
there's not much else to review about an ATM machine.

Its a bank..
Most of the tellers are friendly they get you in and out.
Get any questions answered.

Tons of Wells Fargos in the area but this is the only one open on Sundays (11-5) and open late till 7pm mon-sat.
These are the Vegas conveniences I really missed when I moved.
It's a small, but full service branch nside an albertsons.
Pretty long lines on a Sunday, but my teller was quick, friendly and super helpful
