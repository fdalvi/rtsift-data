Each time I visit Scottsdale, I make it a point to come here.
It is centrally located and the selection is something to be seen!
The owner is extremely knowledgeable about the pieces in her gallery and very fun to talk to.
Highly recommended!

Nice to find a gallery with pieces that really separate themselves from everything else around.
Stop in and have some fun looking around.
