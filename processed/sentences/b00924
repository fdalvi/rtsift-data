A receipt coupon for a $20 oil change from Fry's brought me to Midas.
And I was also 1k miles past due for an oil change.
I called ahead to make sure they could accommodate me and was told that they were busy but come in about 2 hours and they should be clear.
So I showed up 2 hours later and they were able to take me right away.
The guys there were professional and found some other repairs I needed.
They took the time to actually show me the problem areas.
The manager was supposed to provide me an estimate/pricing on the repairs but when I mentioned that I wanted to run the problems by my regular mechanic and compare costs, he left off the estimate on my receipt.
Of course, I didn't notice until I reviewed my receipt.
I brought my laptop with me because I saw that they had wi-fi and sometimes these oil changes can be longer than an hour.
Well, the wi-fi didn't work but at least my service time was only 45 min and the Cardinals' game was on TV so I had that to keep me preoccupied for a little while.
I'll start at 3 stars and once I talk to my regular mechanic I can see how accurate they were with their assessment.

Definitely make an appt before you go.
I liked the low key sales approach.
They told me my fuel injector needed replaced but for $89 I told them I would wait and check with my mechanic after reading the other review.
Plan on being there for 45 min though.

I got my brakes checked out here and i feel they were very nice and explained everything to me honestly, usually I feel pressured to get more done than what I intended when I go to auto shops but they weren't pushy at all and they even let me use the coupon I had for $50 off.
I will def come back here for any further service needs.
Nice people here for sure.

Do not take your vehicle if you value your sanity and your money.
This was the worst auto repair experience I've had and if I never have another experience like this one, it would still be too soon for me.
