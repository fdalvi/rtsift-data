While searching for new carpet we stopped here to check out the choices and prices.
Huge showroom.
So many choices of flooring.
I wish I could have hardwood, too many rules in my condo HOA.
:( I knew I wanted a medium dark gray carpet.
I found the perfect color, great padding, you have to have good padding.
And best of all a great price.
The Salesman David was great.
Did not try to oversell or push anything on us.
He came to our place to measure.
The carpet was installed 2 weeks later and it is fabulous.
George and his team did a fantastic job on the installation.
Professional and neat.
Should I need flooring again, this is where I will be going.

We have had dealings with Cloud Carpet for years and I have to say that there is old fashioned customer service there.
If you want people who really care, you can find it at Cloud Carpet.
I have to agree with the previous reviewer.
Dave and George are great.
I recommend them to everyone.
