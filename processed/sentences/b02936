I had purchased a Laptop from their Gilbert store.
Took it in to this store, because I had questions about operating the laptop.
My questions were answered quickly and correctly, and there was no charge.
A year later, the laptop got a severe virus.
Took it in, got diagnosis, was quoted a price for repairs.
Two days later I had the laptop back in operation.
These guys are pros, and honest.

These Guys are Great from the top on down!
If you have a question they will answer it.
Whether online or in thier store!
Best wishes for your continued success!

Unfortunately, had to take my laptop in for spyware removal for the second time.
Once again, Data Doctors performed a complete repair/cleaning of the system.
Service is professional and knowledgeable.
Turn-around time amazing.
I trust these guys 100%.

Where do you go when you want to date a doctor?
Data Doctors!
No but actually they are really friendly and helpful.

Was quoted $59 + $99 labor for a $39 replacement keyboard.
All I needed was one key replaced.
Replacement key and retainer clip found elsewhere online new for $6.99 delivered.
