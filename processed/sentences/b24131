This place is awesome.
They have cheap used bikes, and the money goes to charity.
What more could you ask for?
The only problem is, because they get their bikes as donations, the selection can be spotty.
I stopped in looking for a used road bike, and they had 58cm and larger frames, and 50cm and smaller frames, with nothing in between.
