Most popular spot on ASU Tempe campus undoubtedly!
This is the house of food, entertainment, sports & activities.
They have a great selection of food, right from Papa Johns, chic file, subway, BK, extreme pita, taco bell, Einstein bagels, Starbucks!
But my fav is the Mexican food place called Z.
They have amazing tostada bowl!

What a wonderful space!
Right on the water...makes you wish you were in college again!

I love the MU!!
:)   You'll always find someone or something to do.
Favorite spots include, the fireplace right by the Changemaker.
It's my favorite spot for studying every morning before class and Its perfect, since its quiet and usually just about half full.
My second favorite spot is right by Starbucks and that area gets packed up quickly so grab the first table you see, thirdly the outside patio.
My only suggestion would be to add healthier options.
So far my top and truly only choices include, AFC Sushi, Extreme Pita and Subway.
Other options here are, Burger King, Papa Johns, Chick-fil-A, but those are pretty lame and insanely high in energy intake.

We held an event in one of the sections of the Vantana ballroom.
It was a nice room and the projector was easy to use with the computer we had.
However, you could hear the people in the section next to you and it was very distracting and hard to hear our speaker over the noise.
