Went here for years, and always just put up with 3+ hour service times for tire replacement.
Often times I would walk to west towne mall and back and they still hadnt touched my car.
They always seemed understaffed.
Sure, I didn't always have an appointment but this place just sucks.
A tire shop should be able to get "just tires" people in and out in a reasonable amount of time.
One time I'm pretty sure I paid extra for a road hazard warranty, got a flat a few months later, brought it in and surprise!
No warranty coverage....full price for replacement.
Go to discount tire on junction rd instead.

I had 4 tires with 30k miles on them.
My problem was my car is 6 years old and the rubber was rotting.
I called ahead, let them know my situation.
They had 4 new tires on hand that fit what i needed...and on promotional price.
I drove in and all tires were changed within an hour.
I'd give them 5 stars if they would have told me they were gonna tinker under the hood...I was a bit upset to see them looking at my battery and fluid levels, but I asked them just to service the tires and nothing else and they accommodated.

Excellently priced tires and I didn't even need an oil change appointment today to get in right away!
These guys rock and are serious about customer satisfaction, which means the most to me!
