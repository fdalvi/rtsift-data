Amazing!!
I have been to 13 different places for extensions and I thought that the messy and painful process they out me through was normal.
I thought my real lashes were supposed to rip out with the extension.
Then I found Alexa!
I can't explain how different and wonderful the experience is.
Everyone asks me where I go and are amazed at how long mine last and the condition of my real lashes.
Thank you for being such a perfectionist and so framing my eyes so perfectly!

I have been seeing Alexa for eyelash extensions for well over a year.
She is so talented.
I Love my lashes.
They are very low maintenance, and always look great.
I would not hesitate to recommend Alexa.
Her technique is painless and she is a true professional.
I usually fall asleep on her comfy table while she is working away!
I always look forward to seeing her, and although her schedule is full of happy clients, she is always most accommodating.
You won't regret using Alexa for your lash extensions!

I never right reviews for anything, but I have to let everyone know about Alexa (Lash Out Couture) I've been going to Alexa for about 9 months.
She is nothing short of AMAZING!!!
I would go as far as saying she is the BEST in AZ!
I was referred to Alexa by a girlfriend of mine that has been going to her for over a year.
When i was considering lash extensions, I almost made the mistake of going to a place that was advertising on Groupon for 1/2 the cost.
My girlfriend convinced me to go to Alexa and pay full price (which was only $30 more than the 50% off price)  My lashes turned out so amazing the first time and has every time after.
I get compliments on my eyes ALL the time.
My lashes last for about 4 weeks, which is usually unheard of by other salons.
The process is very relaxing, I fall asleep every time :)   If you are considering Lashes or you currently get lashes some where else, I would consider trying Alexa 1 time.
You will NOT regret it and You will definitely go back!!
