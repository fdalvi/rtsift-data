Our pizza was totally raw!
Completely disgusting and totally un-edible.
I would give 0 stars if I could.

You know what you're going to get: delivery/take-out pizza.
I'm not expecting gourmet anything and I'm not disappointed.
They're fast, efficient and consistent.
I usually order online and pick it up -- the people behind the counter are always pretty friendly.

Ordered a large pizza with extra cheese for take out last night.
The pizza was smaller than most large sized pizzas.
The crust was like cardboard and there was very little cheese.
$15.00 for a very lousy pizza.
