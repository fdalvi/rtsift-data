Usually this place is OK. Don't try to ask any questions, there won't be any meaningful answers.
Food is Great.
My favorite thing is the diversity of options compared to other mexican places.
This location usually is filled with business casual people.
And, is completely packed at lunch  Now do not get the Tortilla soup to go.
it is $3, comes in an small cup, and leaves the worst taste in your mouth.
Stick with the burritos.

I enjoy the food here.
Straightforward concept like Chipotle and the like.
I am a big fan of the nachos here.
The three cheese sauce is delicious and has a little spice.
I enjoy the salsa here, always seemed fresher than competitors.
The burritos are pretty standard, and always consistent.
My only real concern is that on veggie nachos or veggie burritos you have to pay more for fajita veggies or rice (only on nachos).
Seriously?
I am already not getting meat, which means that it is already cheaper to make.
Other than that, this place will stay on rotation.
This Qdoba is always very clean, not really too busy, and the service is typically pretty decent.

We used to go to the now-closed location at D.I./Durango alot (before Chipotle was here- the cashier said that that location was closed due to numerous robberies).
We came here recently, a couple weekends ago.
It was for lunch on a saturday- nice day so we just barely got a table outside.
Inside was big/spacious, clean and not too many people eating inside either.
The food containers were full.
There were several people working there.
(No drive-through window.
) There was yummy seasoned smelling chicken on the grill which reminded me of El Pollo Loco.
They make it right there in front of you- to your liking (beans, salsa, etc.
), like Chipotle and Zaba's.
Simple menu  (like Chipotle, and prices were around the same too, average price $6-) but no take-out menus available.
My husband had the burrito and I had the hard corn tacos (you could get soft flour tacos).
I think the cost was around $16 (regular price) for the both of us but we had an Entertainment Book coupon so it was half that!
It was very good- as good as I remember, a few years back.
The flavor of the seasoned chicken was really good.
The crunchiness of the corn tacos was fulfilling.
I had corn, lettuce, cheese and salsa.
Notice I keep making references to Chipotle.
I just love Chipotle (been there 3x in a month's time) so it easily edges out Qdoba Mexican Grill; the concepts are similar but not exactly the same, but it still gets high marks.

If you like Chipotle, this is Chipotle.
The only thing that separates itself from Chipotle is that "queso" (cheese with peppers in it) they offered to put in the burrito.
Other than that it's the same exact thing.
They just re-labeled a Chipotle.
The food is fake mexican like Chipotle, but served by clueless non-english speaking servers.
Know what you want, say it loud, and be prepared to point.
Don't make special requests.
You'll ruin someone's day.

I ordered the Nachos, they were pretty good.
I like the queso cheese on the Nachos, and the chicken is good.
I also like the portions.
For me, the chips are a little to salty, but I don't eat a lot of salt in general anyways.
The service was pretty fast and mostly friendly.
Me and a friend ordered together and specifically asked for 2 drinks.
She gave us 1 cup and when we told her again we needed 2, she said "I only charged you for 1" in a somewhat snotty attitude.
WTF, I don't care, charge me and give me another cup.
Other than that everything else was fine.

WTF.
The burrito was tiny, the tortilla was gummy and it was ALL rice with all the salsa and sour cream only on one side.
Awful doesn't even describe it.

Terrible food.
The cheapest nastiest tortillas I've ever had.
And how hard is it to roll a burrito that doesn't just fall apart?
Hate.

I really like Qdoba Grill.
For those who have not been to Qdoba before, the concept is similar to Chipotle.
Burritos, Salads, Quesadillas, Tacos, Nachos.
Select your item, pick a meat, select from an "assembly line" of ingredients.
The ingredients are flavorful and fresh and I've never been disappointed with a meal from here.
Great for a quick lunch or dinner.
My favorites are:  Naked Burrito - just means it comes in a bowl without the tortilla Queso Burrito - perfect medicine for a hangover Grilled Chicken Taco Salad - sans the crunchy tortilla bowl  Favorite ingredients are:  Blackbeans - protein rich goodness Corn Salsa Pico de Gallo - fat free low cal volume  This particular location is ok.
I've been to a few other locations and the staff is more friendly and "giving" on the portions, but overall this is a good location.
Typically I come here for lunch so realistically the portions they are providing for LUNCH are sufficient.

Qdoba is right up the street from where I work, and my coworker is a big fan, so we eat there ever few weeks.
I have only had one thing, the naked burrito.
Naked simply means no tortilla, so no extra carbs, and you are cutting 330 calories!
All the goodies go into a bowl instead.
You get to pick chicken, steak (both of which are good) and I think they have pork as well, but I have never tried it.
Then black or brown beans (I always go with the black).
Then you can pile on the rice, veggies, cheese, sour cream, guacamole and multiple different kinds of salsas.
The corn salsa  is my favorite, but last visit they had a mango salsa that was excellent.
I really hope it is not seasonal bit I bet it is.
Service has always been great when I have gone, and I have never experienced the employees skimping on things like other reviewers have mentioned.
Then again this is the only location I have tried, so perhaps I just don't know what I am supposed to be getting?
I am always happy after eating lunch from Qdoba though, so I am a fan.

Best mexican fast food!
Very yum Mexican Gumbo (vegetarian).

For above fast food mexican food, cant be beat.
cheap prices.
good quality of food.
great taste.
I really like the 3-cheese burrito or 3-cheese nachos.
Having the choice between black and brown beans is also very good in my opinion.
Location is very convenient for me being near my house.
And I would absolutely put Qdoba up there with Chipotle quality of food.

Qdoba Who?
Funniest thing happened, as I walked into a Qdoba I felt like i walked into a chipotle.
Yes, same thing.
Except that I had no idea what Qdoba means, (and I'm Mexican) but it looks more like a middle eastern word.
The concept at Qdoba:  All the ingredients are laid out in front of you.
You pick  from burrito to tacos or just a bowl or naked burrito, you pick your protein, steak, chicken or pork and last you pick all your toppings and you have a meal.
A very good  Quality meal for a very good price, fast!
I really like the location there is plenty of parking  and right across from my favorite star bucks.
The place is clean and the service is also great.
Great for quick lunch or a nice casual dinner with friends.
Some "useful," information.
The word Qdoba has no meaning, it was created by Qdoba marketing because two previous names they used were already being used by someone else.
"funny" so they decided to come up with a unique name and they ended up with Qdoba.
"cool"

So I was always wondering what kind of food Qdoba was.
Little did I know what that it was similar to other places I have ate at.
The concept is the same as a Chipotle or Cafe Rio.
You tell the first person you see what you want and they prepare what you want on your burrito, taco, salad, etc.
The food is good, but it is not worth the price.
Chipotle is virtually the same price and the same food.
If you want convenience, go to the closer one to you because it is virtually the same.

Eating at Qdoba reminds me of eating at Chipotle' except a little more on the mexican side.
I mostly eat there on longer lunch breaks because I'm never sure how big the crowd is gonna be.
Another major factor is that Qdoba's manager comes by my work (a block away) and drops off 2 for 1 coupons, which really is a no brainer.
I like how all the ingredients are laid out in front of you, the workers are pretty efficient and quick to choice selection as well.
I prefer the soft Burritos with Carne' Asada and corn, some black beans, Guac and Sour Cream for a super filling meal.
At the same time, I can't see dropping $8 on lunch when I can get a massive mondo Carne Asada Burrito right down the street at Roberto's.
But, the place is clean, The bathrooms are usually spotless, and it's usually busy at lunch time.
It's twice the distance (2 blocks) from my work which deters me sometimes, and though I like Qdoba, I usually can't find a spot close to it to park with my limited time due to gym crowd and workers parked in the parking lot.
I enjoy this place and will come back every so often.
I don't believe they deserved quite 4 stars, maybe about 3.5.
Cheers!

I am indifferent to the food here.
The salsas are kinda' bland but you can tell that the meat is lean and not fatty.
Whenever this is the only restaurant in sight, I always drive around for a bit to see if I have another choice before settling .

Needed taco fixin's for a last minute office lunch party.
Not being a party planner, I was advised to use QDoba's.
Called and spoke with Rebecca, who could not have been nicer or more accommodating.
She helped me figure out what I needed...and got it to us at the agreed upon time.
The ingredients were fresh and well prepared.
I would highly recommend, and will most likely use again, although we don't have many office parties.
Thank you Rebecca!

What I typically think about Qdoba is that it's just like Chipotle just not as good.
I was in the mood for a burrito bowl and Qdoba was much closer than Chipotle so I thought I'd give them a chance.
Pretty much all the same options as Chipotle.
They offer brown rice as well, but I decided on white.
Service was quick and satisfactory.
Nothing amazing or noteworthy but it sufficed and I was in and out in less than five minutes.
I took my meal home to eat and it was tasty and relatively healthy, depending on what you choose to eat.
Overall the experience was a 3 1/2 star, but I rounded up for convenience sake.
I have to remember that it's in the area, which I always seem to forget.

I am a big fan of Qdoba.
I have been since I was in college in Reno and a Qdoba opened up not too far from my apartment.
This place was awash with kids from the University all the time.
Mainly because it was the first place of its kind to open up in Reno.
No one had really experienced this type of fast-food movement before.
Reno had Qdoba before it had Chipotle.
Overall I like both Chipotle and Qdoba.
There are a few subtle differences, but for the most part is the same style, same food, same way of doing things.
The one thing I enjoy different about Qdoba is the their Queso Burrito, which Chipotle does not have.
Basically you get a burrito (or anything I guess) and you can have queso dumped on it.
Thus making your somewhat "healthy" meal completely and utterly unhealthy (add sour cream for extra fatness, yay!).
This particular location is in a very busy shopping center.
Parking is quite limited.
The restaurant itself is also on the small side.
But, I've never waited long for the food and the employees for the most part are quick and cordial.
I would give 5 stars, but since being introduced to Chipotle I think I like the Chipotle style just slightly better than Qdoba, unless of course I want queso.
Well, then the choice is clear.

First time at this location.
Went in at lunchtime.
Only one server/cashier working but she did a great job moving us thru.
There were at least 6 people in line.
Had a naked chicken burrito with queso and no rice.
Excellent.

Although the prices here are higher than in California, fiancé said we HAD to come here because she was bummed the one in our area had shut down after only 6 months.
Probably because it wasn't charging Nevada prices??
Anyway... pretty straightforward restaurant for Chipotle-style food.
And conveniently located near a 24 hour fitness for the gym junkies who want a healthy choice after their workout.
The guy who prepped my tacos I believe was the prep cook who came over to help because they were getting busy... which came out to be a good thing because he ended up putting good-sized portions on my tacos that I ended up having a chicken bowl after my tacos were finished :)

Qdoba is a hidden gem for those of you that have been hiding under a rock or never heard of it.
The concept of Qdoba is similar to Chipotle and Zaba (healthy Mexican food).
They have quesadillas, burritos, taco salads, tacos, and some of the best nachos with toppings that you can buy.
The queso dip is incredible as well.
You are able to pick your meat of choice as well as the toppings to go along with it.
Very simple.
The naked burrito is by far one of my favorite things on the menu when I want to eat healthy.
You order what you want and they put it in a bowl for you.
The staff are always very friendly and the place is always extremely clean.
Enjoy

Food is good and service is excellent.
Came here after the gym and the guys were friendly and built me a custom meal per my request (since im on a lean down diet).
The meal really hit the spot.. Definitely be back here again!

I use to come here alot , till I ask for a request and the employees acts like they never done it before.
I asked the cook  if he can cook it for me, all his response is I don't know how.
Do the manager asked what I need I told him,  his response was so rude.
And he asked me who done it for me to give  the person's name so he can fire that person.
I said no I'm not gonna give the name.
So I just walk away, I'm never going to that place again.
