I had my air conditioner stop working and needed assistance immediately for my home.
This business was able to assist me within minutes of my call and the technician was extremely professional.
He was honest about what was wrong with my unit (major concern) and fixed my air conditioner the same visit.
The young man stayed to verify that my home was cool again and went the extra mile to make sure I was a satisfied customer.
I couldn't thank this High Country Comfort enough.
I would recommend this place to anyone....friends, family, co-workers and neighbors.

Have been using this company for 18 years and been very happy.
Had a problem and for 200$ I was told ac was working.
20 minutes after they left stopped working.
They were trying to help go thru a home warranty company but that failed.
I made another appt and there was a mixup that was absolutely understandable, then have tried to call for 2 weeks now  no callback.
Wow what happened?

Dave and his staff are professional and honest which for me is number one when it comes to the A/C business.
I was using another company when my a/c wouldn't kick on and after 3 days and numerous attempts at fixing the unit they were convinced that it was the main board which would be an expensive fix.
I didn't feel right, I know I should have cut them loose sooner, I had High Country come out and take a look at the unit.
It turns out the main power supply wire had shorted and needed two feet of wire replaced.
So thanks Dave for saving me hundreds of dollars.
