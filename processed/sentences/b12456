These people love what they do and it shows.
One of the best places in Madison for a create your own deli sandwich - hot and cold.
High quality natural and organic meats and cheeses help this deli stand out.
And the customer service!
These guys are fantastic and totally into what they're doing - making for a fun visit.
I love Artamos Deli.

Boar's Head meats, organic everything, homemade sides, reasonable prices, huge portions, locally-owned and operated...what's not to love?
While I don't buy their meats very often I do go for lunch quite frequently.
Their half-sandwich with two sides special is cheap for what you get.
Great deal.
I'd love to see them expand their deli offerings but that's not to say there's not a large selection now.
Artamos is the closest I've seen in Madison to a NYC deli.
And its WAY WAY better than those gross chain sandwich shops in town.
Don't be fooled by the strip-mall location, this place is worthwhile.

awesome.
quality meats and cheeses.
local, too!
and the people that work there know their stuff.
their make-your-own-sandwiches are delicious and they do NOT skimp you on the amount of meat and cheese they put on them (like some other places ::cough::cousin's::cough::).
you can get hot or cold sandwiches, hot or cold sides .. and all are tasty.
i recommend both the potato and mac salad.
if they have mashed potatoes, those are pretty awesome too.
don't miss this place.
