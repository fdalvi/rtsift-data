This is a nice little family style restaurant.
Upon  entering it is clean, well decorated, and you are greeting promptly with a smile.
I could tell that this place has a lot of regulars eating their this morning.
The waitress all greeted everyone with cheerfulness and some by their names.
The portions are huge and the service was fast.
Temp was good and not microwaved.
My husband and I both ordered breakfast and my son shared off our plates.
I ordered the chicken fried steak, country potatoes, and biscuits with gravy,   When served I had two HUGE biscuits that were nice and fluffy.
The potatoes my son chowed down I hardly got to taste them they went so quickly, my chicken was big and nicely cooked did not taste like it was frozen.
I was disappointed in the gravy though.
I LOVE gravy and this just did not work for me.
It had not flavor at all and I could taste the flour.
I added a lot of salt and pepper but it was still very bland.
So for that I would not order gravy again.
But for the rest of it I was pleased.
My husband ordered the breakfast steak (medium well) and eggs with hash browns.
The steak was the biggest breakfast steak I have seen in awhile it was lapping over the plate.
It was a disappointment though that the steak was cooked medium rare and not the way we ordered.
He ate it anyways but said it lacked flavor.
Hash browns are crispy and brown on the ends and the eggs cooked very well.
Prices are good for the portions.
I would go back and try it again sometime.

I had breakfast at The Place over the weekend.
The portions are HUGE and affordable.
I am not lying when I say that I had the best sausage patty I have ever tasted that morning.
Delicious!
I have no complaints and I plan on returning.
The wait staff are friendly and Trinity Gondella (hostess) is the sweetest of them all.

Descent breakfast.
Need hotter salsa.

OK to good.
One of the better places to get a decent breakfast WITHOUT the corporate taste on the plate.
Food is portioned on the HUGE side, and the prices are fair for the quality and quantity.
Not over the top great but good enough.
Menu could use some expansion.
......

Steak and eggs!!
The homemade green salsa is really good.

Went for the first time this weekend and let me tell you, I was not disappointed!
There was a wait, but they are efficient and got us in really fast considering.
I ordered the country fried steak with biscuits and gravy.
Very happy!
Biscuits are HUGE and the gravy was very flavorful.
We will be back.

Just went back this weekend.
Not as good as 1st few times.
A little bit inconsistent...uh oh..inconsistency kills

I went here on a Sunday morning around 11, the place (haha, The Place) was PACKED.
The waiting room was filled with people along with all tables and chairs.
We had about a 15 minute wait and was quoted 25, not bad.
I had the french toast and my mom had the biscuits and gravy.
I will definitely go back and get those.
I feel that its the safest thing to order from anywhere.
The waitress was awesome and the place was clean.
The only thing I would not recommend getting is water... of all things I know.
I drink excessive amounts of water a day and this is one place I won't get water from again.
Overall though, Ill visit again.

After lasting one night in that spooky L Motel where strippers go to die- I was idiotic enough to take a referral to eat here.
But I always give second chances, and this one failed.
The place was crowded on Monday morning (labor day).
The water was dirty and delayed to arrive at the table.
The table was dirty, and the silverware and napkins were absent.
The food was horrendous, and the eggs seemed like they'd been soaked in water after being scrambled.
The fruit bowl consisted of one grape, and two or three slimy melons.
We sat but did not eat.
Paid the bill and sought refuge in Safeway's deli.
When you're passing through town, get thee to the grocery.
Waitress was super nice though, it wasn't her fault the meal was awful or the place was dirty.

The food - I ordered an omelette.
You can build your own and I went with sausage, swiss cheese, onion, mushrooms and bell peppers.
It was very good; as light and fluffy as it could be with all those ingredients.
The omelette came with either hash browns or fried potatoes and either biscuits/gravy or two pancakes.
It's a lot of food!
I couldn't finish and brought the biscuits/gravy home.
They have a number of breakfast options but I should point out that if you're on a diet you're not likely to find something light on the menu.
The price - the omelette, hash browns and biscuits/gravy set me back less than $9!
That works out to 1/3 of a cent per calorie.
The service - They were busy but the service was still very good.
People were walking around with coffee and we were checked on often enough.
The inside - the restaurant has a diner sort of feel.
It's clean, nicely laid out with a lot of booths and tables.
Things are getting a big old inside but this isn't a fancy-schmancy place so it's fine.
Not on my side of town and my waistline couldn't handle coming here often but if I'm in the neighborhood I'd stop in again.

IT APPEARS TO OUT OF BUSINESS.
we found an empty building and that's it , called the phone number and its out of service.

Good prices, decent food, and huge portions.
The food definitely isn't bad and the prices are really good, but there aren't quite enough healthy options for me to give it a 4.
I like the place better than your average breakfast place, but not by much.

DO NOT EAT HERE!
My friend and I had breakfast here yesterday morning and we've both been up all night with food poisoning.
We've eaten here before and never had a problem.
But apparently it's not so chill now.
BEWARE
