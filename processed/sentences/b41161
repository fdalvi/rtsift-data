Not only do these look awesomely cool but they're a total hit with anybody!
It was my boyfriend and my anniversary and how lame would it be to get him flowers?
BUT I ordered him comic book flowers and he loved them!
His coworkers thought they were great too and a little jealous they didn't have some ha!

If your looking for a one of kind gift for that special girl in your life, be it your wife, mother, daughter or anyone else you can think of then look no further.
Whether a pop culture fan or not, nothing says "your awesome, and I love you" like a vase full of hand crafted comic book or pop culture roses!
Wonder Woman, Superman, or any other geeky icon you will find them here.
Sheli does amazing work and my wife absolutely LOVED her vase of roses I recently had made for her.
An amazing and personal gift crafted by an amazing and caring woman!
Two thumbs up!
!, six if I had that many!

When looking for something that fit the Superhero theme of my wedding I came across her products.
She custom made a Star Sapphire wedding bouquet for me that   blew everyone away.
Not only was it made of comics, it had glitter and smelled like sweet pea and vanilla!
It made my wedding perfect.
I am bad, I also had a throw away bouquet but had to keep it, don't tell anyone.
My husband also had a Green Lantern boutonni√®re.
I highly recommend her!
