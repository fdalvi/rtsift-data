SO happy to have the HUB in Central Phoenix!
I popped into the new store this morning after brunch - it's so nice not to have to battle the large crowds to get to my favorite store.
The owner is delightful, the staff is always the best, so friendly & knowledgeable.
I love the edgey, sexy clothing lines the store has - my new favorite: cameo.
I can't wait to wear my new dress!
You have to go visit for yourself!

First time I have ever spent over $100 on some denim and I am glad I did.
Granted, I was the only customer in the store but they were insanely helpful.
Gave me honest opinions and even suggested the cheaper pair of jeans because she felt they would work better for me.
They had a lot of styles and sizes for how small the store is.
If you are looking for high quality jeans, give this place a try.

Horrible Customer Service!!!
I've been buying jeans here since 2009 and have always been able to find denim brands i just can't find anywhere else.
A couple of months ago i bought a pair of jeans and 3 weeks later attempted to exchange them after not wearing them and I was treated with disrespect being told that i "put a stain on the jeans".
Now we're talking about a pair of distressed Diesel jeans that came stained.
Nearly Every clothing retailer on the planet will honor exchanges on unused merchandise but not here.
They carry great products but I won't being going back.

I LOVE Hub Clothing, they are the only boutique that carry the style of Diesel and Nudie that fit my slim body style.. Peter is always great along with the other staff that are always helpful.
Yes you will pay the retail price for high end denim (180-250$), but if you want clothes that look fabulous and will last, then you might just have to spend a little extra!
money.
Cant say enough good things about this local retailer..
