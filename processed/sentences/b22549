Took my dog there just for a groom.
The gentleman at the front desk was rude and short.
After leaving my dog, I stepped outside the door and heard the groomers talking about me.
When I picked my dog up she looked like she had been hit by a lawn mower.
The professionalism sorely lacked and to say the least, I will NEVER return

I take my dogs on a regular basis to Above and Beyond.
I have for several years.
I moved from Anthem but I still make a 45 minute drive to bring my dogs here.
I am always impressed with the cleanliness and friendliness of this establishment.
The way the shop is set up is it's open so you can always see your pet being groomed nothing is behind closed doors.
It's very reassuring.
Grooming skills are amazing.
I request hand scissor finishing, they never charge extra for it.
My dogs always look great.
They also brush their teeth!
For no extra charge!
This place is amazing.
I completely trust them with my pets.
My dogs and I are grateful to have found this establishment.
I won't go anywhere else.
