This is the worst mani pedi I have ever had.
Total time was less than 30 minutes.
I took my sons girlfriend with me to treat and she couldn't believe I was finished 45 minutes ahead of her.
The women I had was very negative, talked about how bad my feet were and was very rushed to get onto the next customer.
I will never return.

I'm a self professed tomboy, so when I arrived with dry legs and even worse feet, I braced myself for an angry woman with an accent to scold me on my manly behavior.
I was surprised to encounter just the opposite.
I went for the deluxe pedi because I needed the sugar scrub, badly.
The nail tech I had was friendly, asked about how my Summer was going, and didn't mention my neon orange polish that had stained my toe nails a funky yellow.
The sugar scrub on my calves and lower legs felt amazing, and I could feel all my man-skin be scrubbed away.
The peppermint lotion made my toes say "ahhh" in unison as they were receiving the most moisture they'd had in awhile.
My polish stayed on for a long time.
I'll be back again, with hopes that no one will mention my man feet and legs.
*looks down at feet* Yes, I need to go back again, and soon.

This is a terrible place!!!
I felt so sorry for my mother who was visiting me.
I sent her there thinking it would be good!!
NOT!!
The massage lasted one minute!!!
People were rude!!!
Just wanted her $$$!!!
Water was cold!!
Kept asking to warm it up, received attitude instead of complying.
Never again!!
I work at an establishment all over the Vegas area with many cocktail waitresses!!
I will warn them... NEVER to go back!!!
Terrible!!

Expensive.
Pedicure was about 15 minutes.
I had to actually ask to get my cuticles cut.
Won't go back

Not very good.
They were sloppy.
