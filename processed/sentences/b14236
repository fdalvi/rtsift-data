FOOD POISONING ALERT!
I ate here on Saturday 5/29 with my son.
Same evening, him and I are both drastically sick.
My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too.
AVOID.
AVOID.
AVOID.
This one knocked me on my butt.

Ordering food for a friend.
I would never eat at Panda.
Unflavorful and greasy.
I am writing more about the service.
Yes I guess it was food court after all, but that still does not make it right to have bad customer service.
The cashier reached over the counter to grab this small container to see what was in it.
I told her orange chicken, and then she threw it back in my bag and it was tipped over.
Careless.

I usually love Panda Express but I won't be coming back to this one!
The two ladies working were really rude to both me and my husband and were slamming our food and drinks down on the counter.
One lady barely  put any chicken on my plate.
I asked if she could put a little more.
She said "I can for $1.50!".
To top it off they barely spoke English.
Ive never had an experience like this at a panda express.
I won't be back here that's for sure!

The food sucks and so does the service beware of the old Asian lady Linda she is the worst!
Super attitude and can barely even speak!
Avoid this place at all costs it's not worth your money or disappointment!
Just say no
