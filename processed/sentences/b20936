LK Bennett is a mark of quality and you won't have any problems with shoes falling apart here.
They are, however, quite pricey but such is the price you pay for quality and shoes that are a little bit different to the run of the mill types seen everywhere.
They often have sales on where you can find as much as 50% off these babies!
I think shoes are one of those things you really do have to pay a little bit extra for as you can tell a cheap pair of shoes just by looking at them.
Plus, you want something of a reasonable quality too.
