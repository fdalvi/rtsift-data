On weekend mornings they have a great breakfast menu which is definitely worth checking out.
The place looks like a dungeon so between that and the beer they brew themselves it's definitely my favourite pub experience in Waterloo.

Being new to the area, I've been on a quest to find a comfortable pub with a good beer selection and good food.
After a number of disappointing excursions to some of the bars and pubs on King Street and the surrounding area, I decided to venture below Cafe1842 in the Huether Hotel.
Lion Brewery is a cozy place with a large stone fireplace, brick walls, a low wood ceiling.
(My first time there was in winter so the warmth of the place stands out in my mind.
)  Minimal televisions.
Low but lively chatter.
And solid beer choices.
You can't go wrong with a group of friends, an English Ale, and any one of the Lion's pizzas.

Had the worst meal of my life at Lion Brewery.
I ordered French Onion soup as a starter.
It tasted like an entire bottle of pepper had been accidentally poured into it beforehand, making it undrinkable/inedible.
Ordered wings as the main course.
They were, quite literally, battered in salt.
Combined with the over-peppered soup and over-salted wings, my mouth was uncomfortable and on fire.
My friend ordered a Chicken Pot Pie.
He found chicken bone fragments in it.
All in all, not a good experience.

It would be hard to wax lyrically about the food at the Huether because it takes far too long for the food to come.
If we weren't celebrating a birthday we would have left.
Seriously doubting a return visit.
Perhaps they need a bigger kitchen or serve fewer people.
In any case it's been an hour, it's Friday night and our appetizer hasn't made it to the table.

Came here with a huge group of coworkers (20+).
Pleasantly surprised.
We sat in the cavern - and we literally had the whole area to ourselves.
Waitresses were pretty prompt with beer, drinks.
Delivering food was a bit inconsistent, but the kitchen probably got slammed with our orders so I don't blame them.
I just felt bad because one person had to wait a long time for some pulled pork.
Portions are huge and in the end the bill was pretty reasonable.
It's a pretty cozy place with a decent menu that serves a variety of tastes.
The burgers are good and there were folks who enjoyed fish 'n chips, pulled pork, and wiener schnitzel.
Would I come back otherwise?
Probably not.
But good for groups.
