I love this place.
I do all my postal needs at the UPS store.
The employees are so friendly and helpful.
If you go in enough they will start to know you by name.
They are also pretty quick - I rarely ever have to wait in line.
Fun things you can do here: ship packages, buy stamps, copy paper, buy cards, get things notarized, they have PO Boxes, fax stuff and the list goes on and on....

I was picking up some take out from next door and realized I had a package in my car that needed some delivering and decided to multi task!
I got there a bit after six, the lady who was working was obviously closing up but let me drop it off anyways- super nice!
Come the next day I realized I was supposed to drop it off at fed ex and not UPS.
I went to the fed ex website to try to track it & thankfully it was off for delivery.
This UPS store was kind and thoughtful enough to make sure my package was sent with the right people.
They totally did not have to do that and it was so sweet of them.
I will definitely be going to them for future package/shipping needs.
A million plus for customer service.

This location is terrible.
Save yourself a headache and go a mile down the road to the UPS store on 44th and Oak.
I bought a box to ship my laptop in and they said I had to go put it together in the parking lot even though I bought it and was shipping it at their store.

I don't often write reviews, But this UPS Store is by far one of the best stores we have Ever been to, and will continue to do business with.
My aunt had to move her entire house out of state, and we needed about 40 boxes worth of personal belongings to ship.
Not only were the price of shipping boxes reasonable and convenient, after my family and I packed the boxes at our house, the owner personally picked them up from our place and took them to their UPS Store on 44th street and Indian School Road.
My aunt could not be more happy and relieved.
Very personable and professional service.
