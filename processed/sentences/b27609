How often have you come across an apothecary?!
The only time I was ever aware of such things was in high school studying the plague.
So naturally I had to go in.
I was so surprised by the amount of different scents, candles, soaps creams, and everything else smelly.
Yeah it was really expensive (£13 for a bar of soap...) but if you're having a big party, or trying to impress your mother-in-law, or just want to feel posh for a while then it's worth it.
Furthermore, when I was in I noticed they were doing MINX nails - google it!!
I've seen them in magazines and nearly started to cry when I was given an appointment as part of my 21st.

Dollyleo is beautiful, it's really individual and I can't think of anywhere I can compare it to.
Dollyleo stock innovative skincare and beauty products, many of which are exclusive to Dollyleo.
The beautiful items here are perfect for gifts or just if you feel like treating yourself.
Why not, eh?
The staff are very friendly and knowledgeable about the products and whenever I've ventured in I've never felt pressured to buy anything.
The last time I popped in was with a friend who laps this kind of stuff right up and has more money than sense.
She a very girly girl and is obsessed with having the perfect nails and spent around £60 in here on treatments for her perfectly maintained talons including a rather pricey cuticle treatment.
I'm not as quite high maintenance and just giggled at the word cuticle.
Such a funny word, plus, it's my ultimate "Eye Spy" word... nobody ever guesses "C for cuticle" it's always a winner.
Anyway, I digress.
Overall, a gorgeous little pampering boutique with a stack load of beauty goodies, definitely worth a visit.
