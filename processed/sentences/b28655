Just along from the well known Southsider Pub, and right next to Bonsai restaurant on West Richmond St. is this wee cafe.
The Richmond Cafe doesn't exactly immediately draw you in.
It looks like a fairly standard affair.
The one off putting feature is the low quality photographs of bacon and eggs in the window, something I've never found understood or found appealing.
Inside the Richmond Cafe slightly improved.
Its big clean tables, high ceiling, arched stone brick walls, the place does have some atmosphere and in particular if feels spacey despite its actual size.
Apart from the standard affair of hot drinks, the cafe also serves main meals.
These are mostly Italian or tea time classics, like carbonara or soup.
There is a surprising range, but I get the impression the dishes are not all  exactly freshly made using local produce.
The Cafe also advertises its morning special, takeaway bacon or sausage roll for £1.60, which isn't terrible, if that's your sort of thing.
In its defence the Richmond Cafe also offers a 10% student discount, which is always a bonus.

I agree with Jonny L. on this one: the Richmond Café is acceptable but underwhelming.
They have a standard range of sandwiches, tea and coffee, pastries and breakfast foods, and it's quite a pleasant and spacious place,  I've only been in for coffee, which was neither especially good nor especially bad - just straight up coffee really.
I'm also not quite sure how they stay in business, as it's always been empty when I've been in, but perhaps they have occasional rushes of customers, especially if the weather's nice when it must be tempting to sit outside and admire the scenic main road next to the café.
