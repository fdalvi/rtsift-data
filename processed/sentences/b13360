Recently hired A Wise Move to move from one house to another.
They were early to arrive, very nice and did a wonderful job.
Pricing was fair for 3.5 hours $292.00.
They also reassembled all our items and moved things from one room to another as I decided where they should go.
All of my possessions arrived in perfect condition.
I highly recommend this company for fast, efficient and great customer service for anyone needing to relocate.

I hired A Wise Move and I must say they did an impeccable job!
I work in an industry where good work is appreciated and people return to me based on the work I do for them and I will be recommending A Wise Move to everyone I get the opportunity to!
I am so incredibly pleased with the move!
And @ a reasonable price!
SOOOOOO worth it!
I will be using this company the next time I need to move!

I hired A Wise Move twice in the past three years.
When I sold my home and when I was remodeling.
The price is reasonable under $300 for a 3 bedroom house and $85 to deliver all the material for wood floors.
They are prompt, fast, clean, helpful and very careful with my things.

My husband & I were getting ready to relocate after a year in a assisted living facility.
We had our furniture & things in a storage unit & in the AL apartment.
We are both disabled & needed lots of extra help at a affordable price.
We decided to see if any other Yelpers had suggestions for a good moving company.
We read the great reviews on Yelp about A WISE MOVE & decided to call them.
So glad we did because we hired Mike & his crew for our big move.
They took great care of us & our stuff.
We were very impressed with  their professionalism, speed & efficiency.

We used a wise move recently and it was everything I would have hoped for.
We had one 26' truck and 2 movers.
They were very careful with my belongings.
Nothing was damaged and the move was extremely smooth and efficient.
I have heard horror stories of people who used moving companies, but I can attest, these guys were nothing like the other companies that give movers a bad reputation.
I wl definitely be using A Wise Move with any future moves and recommending them to everyone I know.
