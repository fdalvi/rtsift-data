As much as I like the breakfast at McDonald's, I will no longer be going to them.
WHY?
One reason, their Wi-Fi.
It is without a doubt the absolute worst on the planet.
Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks are fantastic but McDonald's is very, very, very bad.

This Mcdonald's is no different than any of the other's when it comes to food at least.....and I have only had there ice cream....and mocha drinks.
The one unique thing about this place though is it is always PACKED....I mean the drive-thru is ridiculous.
I say unique because it is surrounded by all kinds of wonderful places to eat.
There is Olive garden.....red lobster......outback steakhouse....In and Out burger....CoCo's.....5 and diner....Island burger......Laparilla Suiza......Barro's......Chick-Fi-La.......Picasso's........IHOP.....and they are even building a new Culver's and all of this in walking distance of this mcdonald's.
Yet these people invade this establishment like it is the last Mcdonald's on earth....don't know whether that is good or bad...but for me I will pass.
Eat, Drink.
and be Merry my Friends!!

Been here a few times, just a normal Mcdonalds, well, was.
Pile of rubble as of 07/01/2014.
Don't know if they're rebuilding.
