Great company.
Did a great job on my install.
Excellent customer service

Had a great experience.
Would recommend to anyone looking for a good deal and great service.
I've used them a few times and will use them again in the future.
It's nice to work with a local company instead of some 1-800 number.
Two thumbs up!

Because our TV is still under warranty and they did the installation, I needed to call them to change bad wires that are in the wall.
I have had two appointments and they have not shown up at either.
They just didn't show up either time and no phone calls.
What gives???
