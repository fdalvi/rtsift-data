A hidden gem on the South side of Edinburgh.
Part of me hates to give it away in fact but this is a superb supermarket for all your Asian food needs.
I am never without a packet of their dim sum in my freezer and I always end up finding a new ingredient to try out.
They have a monstrous selection of noodles, every Asian sauce or spice you could ever want, heaps of frozen dim dum and some weird but wonderful delicacies for the adventurous.

Love this place and it's on my way home from work so I stop in a couple of times a week for allsorts of culinary bits and bobs.
My main stay items are frozen edameme for £1 or so a bag, udon noodles for 40p, various marinades/spice mixes for pennies, soup noodles galore and the bargains in the freezers.... £2 for 50 frozen spring rolls!!
The staff are freindly, place is clean, well organised and modern.
One of my favourite places for asian ingredients.
