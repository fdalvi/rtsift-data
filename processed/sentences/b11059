I came here a couple of weeks ago and instead of skipping over their Weight Watchers menu I actually tried something on it.
They had two salads on there that sounded interesting one had fruit in it and the other one had steak and potatoes.
I tried the one with steak and potatoes of course!
It was different but it felt like a whole meal and it was good!
The salad also had fresh spinach and finished off by a tasty vinaigrette that I wouldn't mind having again!

My friends and I came here a couple of nights ago.
We had a great time and all the food came out right.
Heather was a GREAT server!
She had a great personality the entire time.

Kudos to Applebee's for opening early for breakfast to raise money for the families of the two Metro Police Officers and a citizen recently killed in Las Vegas.
Breakfast was very good, the service was excellent and thank you for being a Community Partner.
All funds raised will be donated.

Food was pretty good.
Service great.
We like this Applebee's location better than others in town.
