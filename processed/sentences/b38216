It's a Piece of Cake is far superior to the other specialty cake shops in town.
Two reasons .... first, they use a marshmallow-based fondant that actually TASTES yummy not bland, and second ... the owner, Cindy, really cares about her clients and puts 100% of herself into every delicious concoction.
If you are looking for something unique, flavorful, and STUNNING then look no further than Its a Piece of Cake!
I've gotten baby shower cakes, birthday cakes, and Cindy even did wedding cakes for more than one friend .... with every single customer highly satisfied and incredibly pleased with her work.
I recommend you contact IPC for all your specialty cake and cupcake needs!

Ok I have only been once so not sure fair but not going back so writing based on that.
For the price it didn't seem worth it.
We didn't finish what we got.
We tried it versus some other places as was in shopping center, however the selection wasn't impressive.
Most were basic, chocolate and vanilla combos, vanilla with PB frosting, red velvet, choc chip cupcake with basic frosting.
The frosting was thick and heavy.
The cake moist but not so special.
If I'm splurging on a cupcake I want a wow flavor that's unique and worth it!
We aren't into red velvet like someone tipped, and based on our experience there are better places in town.
The people were rushing us as a big group was there too so we felt pressure to pick quick as well.
Not so easy with a kid lol.

Went in to check this place out and was not impressed with the small selection.
For the price I could have done better at home.
Which sucks becuase I really wanted to like this place.
I guess I will keep making the drive over to The Cup cakery in Henderson.
BTW, the girl with the pretty eyes needs to greet the customers with a smile and not look like she hates her job.
Sorry but this was my impression.
The one star is strictly for the effort.

Yummy frosting.
The cupcake was as good as Magnolias in NYC.
Very good I'm happy that I ordered a cake as well at the same time.

I was skeptical of this place at first.
I mean 2 dollars and some change for a cupcake is that worth it really?
Also the space was very clean but the selection was very little.
I bought the red velvet and the strawberry cupcake.
I brought the cupcakes home and tried the red velvet first.
The cake was very moist and the frosting was decadent!!
I could not stop next I had the strawberry cupcake dare I say it was better than the red velvet!!
This medium sized cupcake was absolutely amazing!!
The cupcake was well worth it!!
Yes there selection is small but The flavors they have they have mastered and perfected.
I would go and have gone back there.
Pure decadence!

It's a Piece of Cake made our wedding cake and we were ecstatic with how it turned out!
Cindy was very helpful and had a great sense if humor.
She was responsive from beginning to end and ensured our delivery to the restaurant was seemless.
We also had an atypical color and flavor request which ended up being absolutely perfect.
I have already recommended them to a friend!

Great

Was so so excited when I saw the sign go up for this cupcake shop in my neighborhood!!
I was definitely not disappointed!!
I went in on a whim after eating dinner with my hubby and we got a couple cupcakes.
He had the Oreo cupcake and I had the strawberry!!
They were both Devine!!
But the Strawberry was seriously epic!!
The cake was moist & bouncy and the frosting was sweet but not too sweet with small fresh bits of strawberry on top it was heavenly!!
I craved it for days!

I was looking forward to bringing home some delicious cupcakes and they really fell short.
I was disappointment that they had no problem selling me 2 cupcakes that were oddly shaped.
I bought 4 cupcakes for $10 and some change for that price I was expecting quality.
Other than the birthday cupcake the others were regular store quality, I could have gone to Smiths for that.
Piece of advice, take pride in your products and don't sell anything that you wouldn't be proud of having your name on it specially when it comes to presentation.

I wanted a "beer pong" cake for my boyfriend's birthday.
Before placing my order I shopped around and priced what my cake would be.
I chose this place because it was by far the cheapest for the result I wanted.
When I called to place my order they were super helpful.
I asked what idea they had in mind and they said they would use their marshmallow based fondant and build little cups.
Exactly what I was envisioning!
It's a drive from where I live but when I finally saw the cake I knew it was well worth it!
It was much bigger than I thought it would be and it was placed on a big piece of wood so it was super sturdy since i told them i would be transporting it to Brian Head for the weekend.
They even helped me to my car!
My boyfriend loved it and so did everyone else.
I chose red velvet and it tasted just as good as it looked.
The cake was moist and really tasty.
I'm personally not a big fan of frosting but the frosting was very good.
I'd definitely make the drive and order a cake here again!

Gave this one a shot.
The flavors are great..The selection is small (not a deal breaker) but the cupcakes we're not baked the same day.
It was a Sunday so hopefully it was a one time thing.. To succeed they need fresh cupcakes daily, period..
I'll give then one more chance

Cookie butter macaroons!
Cookie butter macaroons!
Quite possibly the best sweet treat I have ever tasted.
I can't wait to try everything this place has to offer.
Check it out!

I only bought cupcakes here that were already on display so I can't really vouch for their cake baking skills.
The cupcakes we tried were pretty good, not phenomenal but in their defense I haven't had a cake in Vegas that really stood out.
Priced like all these other cupcakes places, about $3.50 each.
The frosting is a little heavy but the cake part is moist.
They are new so the place is pretty empty.
I would consider inquiring about a cake in the future simply because they're so close to me.
The only thing I didn't like, and it stood out, was that the lady that helped me seemed irritated that I didn't want to buy a dozen cupcakes (I only wanted 6).
I thought a customer is a customer?
We were walk in's so I was a little taken aback from that.
It may be a while, but maybe one day I'd come back.

Friendly and knowledgable customer service.
Limited selection with a tiny piece of paper on the counter with how much everything costs.
They have a cookie called "pile of crap" I think....which was unusual and turned me off.
The cookie butter macaron was hard like a cookie or cracker rather than a macaron.
However the strawberry cupcake I had was very pleasant with ACTUAL STRAWBERRIES in the frosting which I prefer over an extract or artifical flavoring.

Love this store.
Been there a few times and the cupcakes are always yummy.
Love the frosting too.
My work even hired Cindy once for our monthly birthday treats.
This place is a winner in my books.
Going back soon for more.

Decent cake, Mickey/Minnie theme for twins (boy & girl...
The accent was misplaced in her name unfortunately).
Moist cake and the butter cream was velvety.
It was a perfect size for about a dozen kids plus parents ... Only had 3 thin slices leftover!
My only complaint is that the fondant was really thick, kids were peeling it off and throwing it away, eating only the "cake".
Also know that we told them we'd pick up the cake by 5pm, arrived close to 4 and the cake wasn't ready yet...
Figured an hour wouldn't matter but in this case it did; went back at 5 and it was done.

After visiting several cake shops, I brought my ideal to Its a Piece of Cake & Ruth listened and delivered!!
Since my cake design was created only in my mind, there was no pictures for them to go off of.
Thanks to Cindy and her amazing team, they made my husband's 40th birthday one to remember for years to come!
The cake far exceeded my expectations!
No one could believe that it was a cake because of the complexity and all of the little details!
My cake was ready on the pick up date & time as promised!!
The cake was very moist (carrot & marble) and delicious!
I have already recommended to friends and now they want to order cakes from them too.
:)   Well worth the money for a memory that will last a lifetime!

While my boyfriend and I were waiting for our take out order from Spaghetty Western, I decided to look at this cupcake place next door.
I read some of the reviews and a few had said that their strawberry cupcake was very good.
And I LOVE strawberry so I was like, "Why not!
Let's just try one!
"   So we went in to order exactly that strawberry cupcake.
The place was very basic with limited flavors/varieties to their cupcakes.
Everything was quite simple.
Each cupcake are $2.75 each I believe, so a little bit less than $3 per cupcake.
The presentation was very cute and there was a heart on top.
However, when we ate the cupcake, the frosting was HEAVY and SWEET.
I suppose you can say it was rich.
There was strawberry flavor ... to the FROSTING.
But because it was way too sweet for me, I had to scrape the majority of the frosting off but when I ate the rest of the cupcake that way, it no longer had any strawberry flavor to it.
There was no flavor to the cake.
I was quite disappointed.
I remember glancing at a review and someone said there were actual strawberries in their frosting ... but there were none.
It wasn't particularly super moist either.
I've had better.
A-okay but don't think I'll return.

I moved to Vegas in January and since then have been trying all of the cupcake shops in town.
This place is, by far, one of the best if not the best!
I can't vouch for their cakes, but the cupcakes are awesome.
Yes the frosting is sweet and heavy, but that's what a gourmet cupcake should have!
The cake part is moist and very tasty.
They are very well priced, being the cheapest I have found so far for single cupcakes, And the shop is small and not in a busy part of town.
The guy that helped me was very polite and answered my questions.
Only downfall is their lack of selection.
Their cupcakes are delicious, so I wish they would make MORE because I would probably be there everyday!
I think I have found my new favorite spot and look forward to placing an order for my 30th birthday cake here this year!

I had been speaking to Cindy for about a month before we arrived from Chicago.
When I got to the location 4 days before the event, the cashier stated they were not taking orders.
Luckily,  an exception was made placed the order and picked up the cake.
Unfortunately,  my mom didn't like the cake and it was frozen.
The cake portion was dry.
Its a shame too because the place was conveniently next door to the restaurant we were having dinner.
Needless to say, we will not be ordering in the future.

My absolute favorite cupcake shop in the city!
Sprinkles whaaaaaattt?
These cupcakes are from a mom and pop shop, homemade fresh daily!
They have a really cool chalk wall you can write on too.
Definitely recommended.

Annoying and inconsistent.
Came in on a Monday evening to put in a request for my daughters birthday party on Saturday, baker wasn't available so I left all my info to be contacted.
Was told that they only needed 2  days notification.
Didn't get a call from bakery until Wed.
Went back in and put in our request and was told they weren't able to do it.
What a waste of time and energy.

Stopped in to pickup something for Mothers Day, I thought there might've been some mini cakes or cupcakes with a Mothers Day theme, but there wasn't any, so I settled on a few strawberry cupcakes  and a birthday cake one for me.
Thou they are tasty and moist, the price being a bit high for the size of the cupcakes.
$2.75 for a plain ole normal size cupcake!!!!
I'd love to see a bigger cupcake if I'm paying that much.
The birthday cake one tasted like a plain white cake and it was the frosting that really only had a flavor.
I probably won't be coming back.

AMAZING!!!
These are truly the most amazing cakes and cupcakes you will ever eat!
I've had all of my kids birthday cakes made by It's a piece of cake the last cake we ordered was a Mikey ninja turtle cake which was chocolate cake with Oreo filling, can you say HEAVEN!
I also go all the time just to get cupcakes I live in Aliante so it's a long drive but totally worth it I have to tell all my co workers when I'm going so I can get them their "fix"!
We walk out with a few dozen cupcakes every time!
I recommend them to everyone!
Thank you It's a piece of cake for helping me keep my girlish figure we love you!

Just read about what they do for foster kids and I think that is amazing and I would support this business just for that.
YOU ROCK!

I ordered my daughter's Disney Frozen themed 6"cake and cupcakes totaling $250.
I provided pictures and ideas to the owner and thought they would come up with a great cake using no fondant.
When I picked up the cake, I was extremely disappointed so much so I broke down crying in the car on the way to the birthday party.
The cake was so plain that I could not believe I spent the amount of money for what I got.
The top of the cake had white frosting, white snowflakes, the #4 in white and white Olaf (it looked like a blizzard).
They could have used a little more creativity or how about color!!!
The Elsa and Anna picture was cute but It was so small and bordered with more white frosting.
The only blue was around the cake itself.
The cupcakes were alright but no flavor.
I asked for them to be mixed with blue and white to have the "Frozen" colors with raspberry filling but it was plain vanilla and 1/3 rd of them were tossed out at the party with only a bite.
The husband of the owner called me after I left the store reassuring me his wife would call me on Monday and  make things right even though they could not fix the cake on the day of the party.
I was willing to wait for the owner to call and make things right prior to writing a review because not for nothing mistakes do happen even on special occasions but obviously they just don't care it's all about the money for them not the quality.
