Stopped by this place with some friends randomly while in Vegas and had a wonderful and educational experience!
Like they said on their yelp profile, they treat their customers the way they want to be treated, and it certainly shows.
Will be adding more to the review soon...

A family owned and operated business, very professional, very friendly, had an excellent experience here.
They will evaluate your coins based on numismatic value versus value of the metals and pay you whichever is the higher price.
Their commission is 10% which is very reasonable.
I just relocated from California to Nevada and had rare 8 coins tucked away for a rainy day.
In my situation, the payout was based on the value of the metals (one gold coin, the rest silver).
The money I received from Round Em Up Coins paid sereral large bills that resulted from my move so needless to say I am one happy camper.
If you are looking for a fair deal and people who know their stuff, look no further.
My highest possible recommendation.

Are we talking about the same store?
We handed over $30,000 to Kenny to buy silver and have not heard from him.
We call and call but he won't answer and will not give us the silver or our money back.
Be very leery of this business.
We are in the process of trying to find a way to get our money back.

I've been in once before and the pricing is decent.
They are helpful, but the selection is lacking.
Also....I would expect that they would be open during posted hours.
I have been by three times during business hours and they were closed.
Not even a vacation note.
