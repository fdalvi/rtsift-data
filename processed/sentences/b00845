This Pizza Hut is just a take-out location, no eat-in; they may do delivery also.
It's best if you call your order ahead and stop by to pick it up rather than dropping by.
If you drop in and order, you'll need to wait about 15 minutes for your order.
They have their best-selling pizzas and 2-liter sodas.
They're on the corner in a busy, tight shopping area on N 16th Street.

Good service at this location, Robert acknowledges you as soon as you walk in the door.. Orders are always correct too

Called today to place a large order to send to a local business as a thank you for helping us out.
Spoke to Jeff who worked out an AMAZING deal with us for a group of pizzas.
Then after he got my card number, he discounted it some more.
Excellent customer service and price.
The pizza was enjoyed by everyone!
