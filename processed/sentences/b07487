I have noticed this deli for a while, it is right down the street from my work.
Today I thought I would give it a try and am glad I did!
It is a family owned shop, very friendly people.
I ordered the Albondigas Soup, fresh and homemade and quite delicious!
The menu looks like a wide variety and great prices.
I can't wait to go back to try one of the sandwiches!

Great sandwiches and the owners are so friendly!

I love their whole menu.
I always get fast and friendly service.
Never had a bad experience.
Love this place :-)

Great breakfast and great sandwiches.
Family owned, and very well priced.
I would recommend trying them out!

Amazing sandwiches and soup.
Today I had the albondigas soup and the roast beef sandwich.
They were both so good.
The wait staff was friendly and helpful as well!This is the second time I have eaten here and I am truly impressed!
