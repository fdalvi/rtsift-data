They still have the old menu until Sept '11.

I always like to stop at Paradise bakery because I like their tea only today I purchased a muffin.
I just wished I didn't have terrible allergies right now because well I couldn't taste it.
This review is based on service.
The staff is pleasant and nice.
They were all working together to get our order completed.

This is a review of the giant cookie.
I ordered one recently (snickerdoodle), and it wasn't very good.
The cookie seemed like it had too much flour in it.
Very doughy (not raw-doughy, too much flour doughy).
As a result it was also pretty dry.
And they never asked about color for the icing design.
I should have thought of it myself, so I have to take some of the blame.
They picked a ridiculous color combination (red and zinc chromatic green) for me.
For an order like this they take your phone number, but they never called me to say "hey, you didn't specify a color".
I don't think I'll be ordering one from here again.
I had better luck last time at the Paradise at San Tan Village.

This location is inside of the mall food court.
Given its location it usually has a line no matter what time of day, but they move through it quickly and efficiently.
This last visit I decided to have a half order of the Greek Salad with Chicken.
I waited a few minutes, and they whipped it up fresh and it was boxed up in a container you could either eat out of immediately or take away for later.
I've had their cookies on other visits, and they are always fresh and tasty.
The service at this one is consistent and they are always moving with a sense of urgency, so if you're in a hurry, don't be deterred by a line here.
Overall: A A good food court option!
