I love this hairdressers.
For anyone who knows me, they will know how important my hair is to me, so i need to have a good hairdresser that i trust.
I started going to this branch of Cheynes when i moved down to Leith and joined the David Lloyd gym in the same building.
Now i live up at the Meadows, it's not exactly handy to get to, but it's worth it.
All of the staff are lovely, in particular the receptionist and my hairdresser Tracy.
They are always on hand to make you feel relaxed, offer you endless cups of tea, coffee and bucks fizz on occasion :)   There is lots of parking outside, so although they are a bit out the way, that's fine.
The prices aren't cheap, but you do get what you pay for.

Ive been to a few different cheynes and this one is definitely my favourite.
All the staff are very nice including reception and its not too loud/busy.
The only bad thing is the price as its very expensive.
