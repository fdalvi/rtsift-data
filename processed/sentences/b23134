Hello you, it's me again.
I went slummin' big time today over in Monona.
I decided to stop and get myself some good ol' Taco John's fast food.
They call their food "West-Mex," instead of "Tex-Mex.
"  So..........so clever, I get the shivers.
I pulled up to the drive thru and ordered a #6 grilled chicken burrito combo.
The eager beaver on the other side screamed at me "CHICKEN OR BEEF??
"  Before I could answer she screamed it again "CHICKEN OR BEEF!!!!!!!!!
"  I admit, I was irked by this, but I let it slide because I'm just good natured like that.
You know how I roll.
However, when I got the window a girl, perhaps late teens, early twenties, glared at me while I handed her the money.
She took the money and then slammed the window shut so hard it actually bounced back open a little ways.
After waiting for at least 5 minutes, she opened the window again and thrust a bag at me, and then again slammed the window shut.
I looked in the bag and saw two beef tacos.
WTF?
I ordered #6 grilled chicken burrito beeeeotch.
My jolly good nature was quickly flying out the window.
Despite her "I hate you and want you to die" attitude I decided to cut the kid some slack.
Retail is hard, working fast food is harder.
So I looked earnestly at the window until she opened it again and glared at me.
"This is the wrong order," I said quite kindly.
Then she looked at me like Bon Qui Qui from King Burger on MAD TV and said "oh hellllllll noooo!
"  She grabbed the bag and slammed the window shut again.
I waited another five minutes, hoping she wasn't in the back making up my burrito with a side of steaming terd to go.
She flung open the window again and said "What!!
What did you order!!?!?!
"    At this point I had lost my patience, and I hulked out.
"ARE YOU KIDDING ME??
I ORDERED A #6!
"    This did not phase her.
She just slammed the window shut again.
I considered ramming my car into the building repeatedly until they gave me my burrito.
I also considered tying her to my bumper by the hair and then speeding away.
But no, friends, I did not go postal.
I just stared at the reflective window and daydreamed about her falling into the deep fryer.
Just then she opened the window and thrust another bag at me.
I took it, and as I looked up at her once more, it seemed like slow motion.
The word F*CK slowly bellowed out from her festering mouth.
Stunned, I looked down into the bag to see that the order was finally right, so I looked back up at her as she was for the last time violently slamming the window shut and yelled "YOU DESERVE THE EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH AWARD!!!
"  Then I drove away.
After this lovely exchange between two well-mannered ladies, like afternoon tea in the sun garden in our frou-frou garments and wide brimmed hats, I promptly dropped my burrito on the floorboard of my car rendering it inedible, (at least to me), and alas I will never know what that steaming terd burrito tasted like.

Don't eat here.
I found a yellow finger nail in my soft shell taco.
I was eating there so I took it up to the counter to show the manager who acted as though it really wasn't a big deal.
In fact he offered to refund me for the taco, not the meal I bought, just the taco.
Um.....
Thanks but no thanks.
I've never eaten  there since.
What made me even more mad was I wrote a letter to the owner regarding the situation and never heard a response.
Very poor professionalism.....not even an apology!!!!
It's too bad I loved taco johns.

Waste of my 3 dollars for a plain breakfast burrito

Its frickin Taco Johns!

Taco John's is far from being authentic or gourmet, but for a fast-food gringo taco chain I really don't think it's too bad.
It seems to be something like what people say Taco Bell was in the '70s and '80s: greasy and filling without being too artificial-tasting.
I didn't really find the place to be especially dirty, or the server to be any less polite than I'd have expected.
I guess the table-service aspect could be making people pay more attention to politeness/impoliteness than they would otherwise.

The staff was friendly, the food was good (for fast food) and the place was clean...
I will be coming here again soon!

My wife and I had breakfast here for the first time and were pleasantly surprised.
Our burritos were very good (really liked that the veggies were crisp-tender and not just mush), the service was attentive and friendly, and the restaurant was quite clean.
I've always liked their salsa bar and it was kept well-stocked.
We'll be back!

Potato oles + side of sour cream = heaven.
The employees at this location are always nice to me and service is pretty quick.
I stay away from the beef taco, they are very greasy and just a weird texture with the meat, maybe it's just me though ;) They have specials throughout the week that change daily, they throw a flier in your bag usually.
