This store is not open to Haggling or making any type of  deals  One of the salesmen is always Drunk lol   There was a Problem with delivery - they wanted me to pay 25.00 because the salesman took that off, after an hour of negation or so-real extra petty!
They then said they can just drop it off, instead of putting the items up as well, as they were supposed to do   I asked to speak to the manager- Left me on hold 15 min Finally they decide to honor what was sold to me   Driver spoke no English   Left my door open, coming in and out with Dirty shoes trampling over the carpet  They left a bag of Nuts on the floor!!!
Hope everything is put up right.
They also left garbage all over my house, including dirty hand prints all over my furniture

Nice selection and willing to work with your on pricing, especially if you are buying multiple pieces and/or paying cash.
Delivery was available for the next day, and even if they had to special order it was only 7-10 days wait to receive.
Delivery man was on time, clean, and cordial.

The sales lady Elaine was very nice and negotiated the price, and told us 2-3 weeks delivery.
Well 4 weeks later I still don't have a couch I paid over two grand for.
They have been so rude on the phone to us.
We understand that things happen, but where is the customer service?
Never once apologized for the inconvenience, or offered to take the delivery charge off.
They said last week that their delivery truck was broke down, not really our problem, again where is the compensation?
We will definitely be going else where to buy any other furniture again!
