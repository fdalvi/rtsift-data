I am from Cleveland Ohio and was visiting my mother after a very bad divorce from my father.
I never write reviews.
However, while in Vegas I went to Optionz to get my makeup and photographs done.
I was very nervous because I had never done this before.
When I came in the photographer Leslie sat down with me and explained the process, where we shoot and how this is to be fun.
She then introduced me to Roxanne (Owner) and Sheen (Makeup Artist).
We all talked about what looks I wanted and why I was doing this.
I explained that the photos were for my personal portfolio so that I could start the online dating process.
Roxanne showed me photos/poses on her Ipad.
We picked four poses and she explained that these were baseline poses but that it would be adjusted to catch me in the best light.
Sheen completed my makeup wonderfully.
She gave me a smokey eye which really brought out my blue eyes.
Once we got going Leslie checked the lights by taking a few shots.
She made some adjustments and then we were off.
It was sooooooo exciting.
I felt like a supermodel.
Roxanne helped me pose and Sheen touched up my makeup through out the 1.5 hr experience.
I did not want it to end.
They made me feel like a superstar.
Leslie had a way of making me connect with the camera.
I would highly recommend this experience to anyone who feels a little shy about standing in front of a camera and previously unknown people.
My mother is scheduled for next Tuesday.
Her and my father recently divorced and I want her to see how beautiful she really is.
I know the Optionz team will make this happen  Thank you Optionz

Bought a Groupon for this place.
I was a little apprehensive since I'm a not a stick figure.
But they were great with suggestions and making me feel so comfortable.
Going again soon!
