lousy!
rude but most importantly she butchered my pants!
DO NOT USE

RUDE!
Ruined my daughters brand new prom dress!
Snagged it then tried to get snags out with hot iron/steam but now the dress has oil like stains all over it.
My daughter has been crying for days and we may have to buy a new dress and prom is in 4 days.
Lady wouldn't come out to talk to us, she's hiding from us and she took our money and won't return it.
DO NOT USE THIS TAILOR

Do NOT used this tailor.
She is incompetent and a bad seamstress.
My pants  had to be done twice and there is a hole in the fabric.
Shame on this business!!!

I really don't know what this people are talking about.
I have been her costumer more than 3 years now and never had any problems.

Hello, I have to say that my experience with PV Tailoring has been a very pleasant one!
I have received top notch treatment and am very pleased with the work and attention to detail on my garments.
Ali is an absolute doll and extremely helpful.
She always manages to squeeze me in and get my items done on time!
I would recommend PV Tailoring to all!
It is in a desirable location and the hours are quite convenient.
Parking is easy too!
Hope this helps all of you new to the area or whatever your needs may be!
