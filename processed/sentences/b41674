I have been coming to K-Land Nails & Spa for 4 years.
They offer great service in a clean and welcoming salon.
My husband gets his nails done here too.
Jenny and Henry have a great staff.
Strangers comment on how great my nails look all the time.
You must try them out.

Very nice salon.
The new owner is great and does great work.
Very professional and clean.
Great salon

I have been going here for years now.
I never leave disappointed.
The one and only thing I do to treat myself to relaxation is a monthly pedicure.
I can get an appointment the same day I call which is really convenient for a busy gal like me.
I used to see Mindy, however I just found out she left.
Henry (previous owner) took care of me today and I am thrilled to say he will be my new "go to".
I always leave feeling rejuvenated upon departure.
I highly recommend k-land nails.

K-Land Nail and Spa does a fantastic job on my nails/toes!
The new owner is very friendly and honest.
He is great at doing the hard gel which is difficult to come by.
The salon is clean and affordable.
I would highly recommend this place.
