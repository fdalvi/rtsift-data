This has been my favorite location to get pizza in Madison since I was a child.
It used to be such a treat to get those pizza twins and argue over the toppings with my sister and I always remember being thankful when i had it.
Not much has changed since, other than the fact that I can afford it eat it when I want now!
I probably order from there 5 to 7 times a month on average and I can't forget their slices which they have available from (11 to 2).
I'm a fan of the inferno wings, hell all of the chicken there is above satisfactory in my estimation.
The Zesty Djion BBQ sauce is one of a kind and I've never seen it replicated in any other restaurant.
It's perfect for the crust  and chicken alike.
I'll admit at times it's greasier than I like but overall it's one of my favorite pizzas in the city from the cheese to the sauce.

Just can't get decent pizza in Wisconsin... sorry... but someone needs to head down to Chicago and learn how to make a pizza.
This place piles sauce and toppings on a crust that can't support it.
you end up with a slide off mess.
Flimsy crap.

Grease running down my hand.
That's a first.
Maybe that's appealing to some people, but definitely not me.
Sorry, Pizza Pit staff.

The pizza here is OK, the staff here is friendly, and they have good daily deals.
