I've been a patient here off and on, for the past decade- whenever my health insurance covered this dentist.
It was a smaller office in the first few years- it's now twice the size.
Though the staff has changed over the years- everyone is very nice.
I am able to get 7 am apppointments which cuts down how much time I miss from work (about 45 minutes).
Appointments are prompt- a nice change from doctor's appointments.
I chose the location mainly because it's very close to my residence- in the Smith's shopping center/strip mall.

I love this Dentistry...My daughter was scared of the dentist and they really took there time with her, and she now can go see the dentist with ease.
Dr.  Mike is amazing.
My family has been to this practice for years.
The staff is very professional and they take care of there patients.
I highly recommend them to anyone.

I can rate 5 stars with confidence based on not only my first visit and consultation, but on the work performed by Dr. Wendelboe two weeks ago; though each persons experience is unique, I can say with confidence that if you are a "dental coward" like myself, prone to anxiety, first impressions are everything-whether walking through the door and being greatly warmly by Mary & Anna in reception, being assisted by Samantha getting dental "impressions" literally, this gentle and caring staff come highly recommended!

This is the best dentist office I have been to, they are extremely professional, Dr. Wendelboe is amazing he is fast, genuinely cares and takes the time to make sure all work is done correctly!
Never had any issues with them, I refer everyone to them and will definitely remain a patient here.
Simply phenomenal from staff, to service to the dentist work!
Love them.
