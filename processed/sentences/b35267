I really liked my visit today... been needing professional shoes for work.
The young gal was very attentive to me and brought me shoes I had indicated I was looking for in my size.
I liked a style that they didn't carry (bummer) but could order, so she was able to order it for me and... voila!
I should be getting my new Dansko pair by Wed!
free shipping!
All 3 staff persons were very friendly and by no means pushy or anything of the sort.. actually very educational.
I will be back if I need to buy comfort shoes in the future.

My wife has foot problems.
I have knee problems.
These things have made us aware of the importance of good footwear.
But good footwear is very difficult to find.
Most shoes are pieces of crap, frankly.
No stability, no support, no shock absorption.
This store specializes in shoes and sandals that do offer such support and quality.
You pay for it, but it's cheaper than suffering foot problems.
And their staff seems to knows their stuff.
If you want to have healthy (pain-free) feet, you need good shoes.
And this is one of the few places you can find them.

Very comfortable shoes & cute!
Aaron is amazing!
Will definitely be coming back.
