Even though I was nursing a hangover and in need of crappy, greasy food, this was a letdown!
First off service was so slow and the cashier was utterly lackadaisical in her attitude.
Oh well, what did I really expect...

Not bad.
Pan pizzas weren't cut all the way through, and of course no knives in the airport, but hot and fresh and everything it needed to be.

The food was old, but what do you expect at an airport late in the evening.
