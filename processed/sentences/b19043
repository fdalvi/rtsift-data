I have only been to Covet once and that was because my hair guy-Joel Porter (formerly of Salon Jo-el right across the street) recently moved his salon into the Covet store.
The store seemed awesome and they have a great selection of men's shoes.
I highly recommend going to see Joel, Jamie or Cassie have your hair done though!
And then you can check out the store!

This is probably the best place to shop!!
i love this little boutique.
it's clothes are ones that turn head and say "fashionista" haha, but seriously it's an amazing store to shop in or to just browse around.
if you love your seven jean, true religions, or diesel you wont find it in this store.
this place carries the best selection of jeans around, from Ksubi, April 77, to Habitual.
The shoe selection is awesome!!
you can't find the kind of shoes they have anywhere in the valley, from Alexander McQueen Pumas, Nike, Swear.
they also have little parties, so if you sign up for their new letter they post when they have gatherings.

Covet rocks!
Ever since Salon Jo El relocated here I've been hooked.
At Covet you can get your hair cut, colored and styled and shop at the same time, which is what I always do.
Not only looking fabulous, I leave with the trendiest clothes and shoes every month.
Hard to find fashions abound here; Randy is so friendly.
If you're going for your hair, please request Cassie!
She rocks!
