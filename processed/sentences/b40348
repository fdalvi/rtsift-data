I absolutely love going to Jackie for all my skin care needs.
She does amazing custom facials and she delivered on everything I asked of her.
She also does my eyebrows and they have never stayed looking so good for so long!
I just went on vacation and had her tint my eyelashes as well, and they have lasted weeks!
Would highly recommend her to all my friends & family.

I have had the privilege to not only work with Jackie but to also be a client of hers.
Jackie is a consummate professional.
Her knowledge of skin care and make up is barre none.
I have been a Lash Extension client of hers for 4 years and can NOT imagine going anywhere else.
She is always striving to up her game with new techniques and services.
I have and will continue to refer Jackie to my circle of friends and professionals.

Jackie is very professional and is awesome at what she does.
She is thorough and makes sure she tells you exactly what she is doing and recommended treatment plan going forward.
I've been to her several times for peels and came away each time loving the results.
Also, I love her cozy treatment room, it's very comfortable and relaxing!!!
She uses Rhonda Allison products which are wonderful as well.
