Cozy place with good fried food and super cheap booze.
I expected some attitude from the locals when stopping in here before a party nearby and got none--partly because we were the only folks there but also the bartender was nice as could be.
Perhaps some day I'll go back and point out the inconsistent apostrophe position in their signage and get punched in the face.

A friendly locals' dive bar.
Don't expect much, however, it's a nice enough place if you need to whet your whistle out yonder.

Due to the third annual Schizophrenia hardcore/gabber event, my friend Aaron and I found ourselves on the outskirts of Madison and in need of whiskey.
Luckily the warehouse we were destined for was by Slices' (Slice's/Slices).
Boy, oh boy, factory bars in Wisconsin pour stiff drinks!

Drinks are stiff, and the bartender is awesome.
I lived in this town for 26 years and didn't know this place existed.
Come in and ask for Justin, he'll treat you right.
He makes a mad decent Tom Collins.
The summer sausage sandwich is a pure Sconnie experience and paired with the mini corn dogs is the bees' knees.
The sound system is nice and the jukebox is deep if that matters to you.

The bar is now called Slice's.
Bullit is gone (thank god).
Great friendly service, great food and the owner is cute as a button.
Justin no longer works there but Kimmy and Brian will treat you right.
There mixology is beyond reproach.
Great fish fry and even better burgers.
