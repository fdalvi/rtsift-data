Artie's Alibi Casino rocks.....EXCELLENT HOME MADE FOOD, GREAT SERVICE, FRIENDLY PATRONS & A GREAT PLACE for single women to hang out ........A super place to have a party whether 10 or 50 people, allways accomodating from hot finger foods to veggies & dips, hire your own DJ, decorate the place up a bit & party the day or night away................5 star review @ WooHoo!
As good as it gets!!!!

This is a dive bar (and I mean that in the best way possible) in North Las Vegas.
Cheap drinks and great bartenders make this place worth the trip (unless you live in North Las Vegas, in that case this is your local joint).
I should mention that the food wasn't bad either.
So don't be such a snob and check this place out.
Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!

I miss the two dollar bloody Marys.
The bartenders are friendly, but not very good at mixing drinks.
Joey the manager is a super nice guy.
They  sometimes use jiggers to mix drinks.
I am fine with that.
It means I won't get a weak drink.
And I don't always want a strong drink.

Attended the official closing on new years 2014. sorry to see it go.
Even more sorry to  see it become a Dottys.
