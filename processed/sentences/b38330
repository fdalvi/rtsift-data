Dr. Budd is an orthodontist of absolute integrity, friendly, well organized , and concerned with each patient.
He has an impressive intellect , remembering movements and improvements with his natural enthusiasm.
He also offers the best pricing and will not advise on teeth extraction unless necessary.
My reference is my grand daughter who was told she needed 5 teeth pulled by another orthodontist, and has a perfect alignment from Dr. Budd's expertise, no extractions.
I was so impressed with her results that I now have braces at 71.
There are patients in my age group , another comfort of Budd Orthodontics, all part of a professional staff and exemplary Orthodontist.

We were referred to Dr. Budd after having an orthodontist who was removed for serious issues relating to incompetency.
My son had to start his treatment all over again and it was a nightmare.
Fortunately, Dr. Budd knows what he is doing and was able to get my son on a good path and fix the poor work that had been completed previously.
Dr. Budd and his staff are professional, fun, and kind.
He also does a family movie day, which is great!!!
I never win any of the monthly contests that they have, but I will not hold that against them (:
