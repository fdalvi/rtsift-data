Like a lot of women, I'm worried about getting conned when it comes to car issues.
I got a nail in my tire the day before Thanksgiving and had to get a new one ASAP.
Luckily, I happened to roll into this place.
Manager Jeff and his crew took my car in right away and put in a brand new tire fast, so I didn't miss much of work.
I was very concerned about getting overcharged, but after doing a little bit of research I found that they actually sold me the tire below average price.
Major props for this place.

At 3:45pm on a Saturday I called JD (asst.
Mgr) @ Advanced, with a busted headlight.
By 4pm I had handed him my keys and by 4:30pm i was leaving the center with an oil change and a new filter along with a new bulb.
The speed and prices were good...the level of service and explanation i got were great and are the reasons I will return when my Accord needs any more work done.
I had received some pretty pricey recommendations from a nearby company I'll just refer to as "Big O T." - wait, no, too obvious, let's just call them "B. O Tires" - which JD explained to me were currently unnecessary and that I shouldn't spend money on them for another 10-15k miles.
I will certainly return to him and them when that time comes.
Why 4 stars, not 5?
Because it was quick, minor service.
They were 100% on point in every aspect, I wouldn't have changed a thing.
I simply wouldn't put a 5 star reco when I experienced such a small part of their offering.
It would be like going to Fogo de Chao, only having the salad bar  and giving them a bad review.
Stay tuned for my next visit, when I get more work done and fully anticipate leaving a 5 star review.
Sidenotes: - Appreciation & general respect for having a professional, user friendly, search engine friendly website.
- I am typing with no "A" key, so the fact that I have been "copy-pasting" every 5 letters to write this review should show how sincere I am in my messaging that I fully recommend visiting JD @ Advanced Auto on McDowell.

Had a flat at 7 am.
They quickly mounted the spare so I could get my son to work on time.
Very courteous  & fast.
Replaced my ruined tire at a very reasonable price when i came back in the afternoon.
Highly recommend these folks.

Found my new Auto repair location, great job.
Will bring car here for future repairs and maintenance!

They tire I had to buy because mt tire got ruined was way overpriced.
I shopped prices after and found I could of gotten for a lost less.
I think they took advantage of me because I am a women.
Would not recommend this place.

I went to 2 other car repair shops -- one of them Whitey's in Scottsdale -- and literally spent $2,000 on repairs that did NOT fix the rattle.
Advanced Auto found it right away.
I feel like I am being treated like a valued customer, not a cog.
I will never, every go back to Whitey's.
They could have cared less, and I spent $2,000 on...likely repairs that were not even needed.

I went to the location on 68th St and Thomas and had a great experience.
I went in to get an oil change and they recommended a few other things, which I went ahead and did.
They were quick, friendly, and did a great job.
I can't say enough good things about this store and location.
It is definitely my new go to for anything auto, great job!
