These guys are cool.
I as looking for some take off part for a sportster I am working on and I could not find them anywhere.
I had driven past this place a ton of times and always see sportsters out front.
I stopped in on Thursday and meet who I think is the owner Scott.
I told him what I needed and he went in the back and came out with it.
He gave me a price but I didn't have enough cash he saved the stuff in the back for me until I could come back.
I went back this morning and pick up my stuff plus some other stuff I needed that he also had.
The guys there this morning were also cool.
This is a old school bike shop where you can walk in tell the guys what you want and they know what you are talking about!

Good prices on bikes and seem to be realatively straight up and honest.
Though I bought a bike there rode it 4 miles down the road and it died (condenser), called Scott told about it and he basically said, "like oh well" bring it in and we will fix it for a price.
It was a simple fix on my part but it is the principal of the thing.

Great place for getting parts and honest advice.
I haven't had my bike serviced there, but have bought parts from Scott.
I once called to order parts from him I thought I needed, and after talking to him for a few minutes he told me to not buy them and that I could actually fix my problem without them.
He was right and it saved me some $$.
The difference is that he took the time to talk to me about my bike, and even lost a sale in the end.
But he gained a returning customer for sure.
