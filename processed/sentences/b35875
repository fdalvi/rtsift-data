Just keepin the review short and sweet.
This place is awesome and it has a cool vibe.
It's just fun and over all a great place to go for a swim.

Great fun, excellent views.
What more could you ask?

Very nice facility!
25 yard lap lanes.
Opens at 6 am weekdays.
I signed up for the lap fitness and technique class.
Monica is my instructor.
She is very good at helping improve my swimming technique!
It is amazing how she has been able to help me.
When I 1st started I could only do 2 laps.
End of 2nd week I am up to 14 laps.
5 Stars for Monica!

Nice new aquatic center right on Hollywood Blvd.
convenient location, brand new amenities, huge restroom area with open showers and ones that has dividers with shower curtains.
Clean & well kept.
Big indoor olympic size pool 7' - 9', a smaller indoor pool 3'-6' and an outdoor pool and an awesome slide!
Lifeguard always on duty.
They offer swimming classes for all ages and party reservations!

Thanks to my cousins we now have a new place to chill.
Silly waiting for cowabunga to open when all that we need for our 7 an 8 year old is at Hollywood Aquatic center.
The place is clean and new.
Really nothing to complain about.
