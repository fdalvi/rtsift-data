If you want amazing results this is the plastic surgeon for you.
I was very nervous, unsure, and had anxiety about my procedure.
Dr. Roth and his staff made me feel very comfortable, answered all my questions, and were very caring.
After my surgery, which went great, Dr.Roth and his staff were there for me if I had any concerns.
Dr. Roth's attention to detail is impeccable!

Dr. Roth is very personable!
I went to him for Latisse.
He was so thorough in answering any questions I had about other things like injectables.

I cant say enough about Dr. Roth.
I bought myself 2 new additions for my 40th bday and they turned out AMAZING!!
Dr. Roth lifted and and enhanced my chest..
He was so amazing to work with and truly showed how much he cares for his patients.
The follow up was awesome and 2 years later I still look pretty darn good..
I have referred 3 friends who are all just as happy as I am.
Dr. Roth is the only one I would trust for my future cosmetic "enhancements"
