I had just moved here from Maryland 3 months before going to Marcedes.
The Dominican Salon i went to twice before kept trying to make me get a relaxer and eventually i ended up cutting it :(.
It was so hard to find a stylist who could tend to my natural hair care needs.
My hair looked a hot mess and I had just been offered a job.
I googled Black Stylists and my search began.
I called Marcedes the night before I was to start my new job.
I explained the story and she took pity on me lol.
She booked an appointment for me  that upcoming Friday....I have been with her ever since.
That was 2 years ago!
My hair has grown and will soon be the length it was before cutting it.
A good talented stylist is so hard to find and trust me I'm not letting this one go!

I've been going to Marcedes for more than a year.
My hair was thinning and shedding, she had worked a miracle.
My hair is now very healthy and shiny.
Marcedes is always very prompt and extremely professional.
If you want a professional, clean and attention to detail stylist Marcedes!
