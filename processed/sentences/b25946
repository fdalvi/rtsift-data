I was looking for a quick bite to eat and saw the dreaded mcdonalds drive thru, so I thought ok whatever.
But then I saw this Mexican place so I decided to try it.
And I'm glad I did, I got a ham breakfast buritto and it was seriously the beat one I've ever ate.
It just tasted so fresh and authentic.
The green sauce they have is great also.
I've been back here a few more times and had the Carne Asada Nachos and Wow they were delicious.
The 2 ladies I see here are very nice and the place isn't that expensive.
I recommend trying this place.
I've only had the breakfast burritos and nachos.
But I'm sure everything they have will taste great.

They put some effort into making some dishes look good!
Items like quesadillas, on the other hand, are plain, and made with just the essentials.
Carne asada is a good judge of what's hot and what's not in these places, and theirs was too chewy, and in tiny pieces...but, it was well-seasoned.
That being said, this is the kind of place you'll only go if you're stuck in the neighborhood a while...you can't find better for miles in any direction.
