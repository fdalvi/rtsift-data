This place sucks...it could be a nice laundromat as laundromats go but unfortunately, they let 20 little kids run through the store pouring cherry flavored sugar straws in with your laundry, and not cleaning up the place..there is always one Mexican lady there who never speaks...I don't think she speaks English, but is never very helpful.
I hate this laundromat with a passion they need to get some better help in here and have more control over the people that wash here.
Plus that it is virtually in possible to get a hold of any one if you want to complain and no one has ever answered one of the comment cards I have left, most of  the time they do not have them, I have been ripped off here had laundry ruined.
Not worth it to go here.

They have machines that work really well on my clothes, even when I come in with 15 loads of laundry.
(They have multi-load machines.
)  The dryers are super fast at drying, and my clothes are practically pressed when they come out.
Free Wi-Fi and television are available.
They also have a friendly staff who told me about several deals they have going right now.
I did 15 loads of laundry last night for under $20.
Nice!

I don't know how it is on weekends but I've gone twice on weekday afternoons and I love that you don't need quarters and that I can do my whole laundry basket at one time.
Just a warning though.
The dryers aren't very strong so make your loads a little smaller.
For the price, it shouldn't be a problem.
