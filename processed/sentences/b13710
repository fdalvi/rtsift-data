Not as big as some other Circle K's but clean and no scruffy customers seen at this location!
I wish I could say the same for the one closest to my house!

Have to strongly disagree with the one and only review I have seen here.
This Circle K is exactly like all the other one's in the valley.
Let's see it's dirty....unorganized.....dark parking lot......scruffy customers......disinterested customer service staff....and other than the drink specials.....everything else is overpriced.
Enough said.....Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends......just not at Circle K.

We're staying in the area for the long weekend and the kids (including a niece and nephew) wanted to get after-dinner snacks.
Hoping to make a quick stop to pick up a pack of gum and other (simple and portable) snacks, the kids opted to get ginormous .79 cent icees instead.
The store associate (with name tag That Guy) was very cool and friendly; he answered all our questions and offered us complimentary hot dogs (due to the late hour).
Although this store is not the most pristine store we've visited, I have to give this store a 5 star rating for the fun and yummy experience the kids had.
As I write this review, my niece is sitting next to me slurping the same icee from the night before.
