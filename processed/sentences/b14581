This place has a great variety of English tack, attire, and horse stuff.
They have rows and rows of breeches.
I bought $700+ boots for less than $300 during one of their great sales.
The staff is really helpful.
Overall great store.
Only desire-more consignment.
It is conveniently located off the 101, but it is a good 30 minute drive without traffic.

What a wonderful store - I am new to riding (English Saddle, not Western).
I had a child and what do ya know, my feet grew!
So I went to buy a pair of reasonably priced boots so I can take up riding again.
Well, to my delight, they had the best of the best and they happened to be on sale!
I got a pair of leather riding boots that fit me perfectly - I have large "runners" calves.
My last riding boots looked cool - but were fake leather!
Yuck!
The amazing boots were only 59.00 - this is unheard of for a pair of top of the line, well made leather riding boots!
So I am one happy girl!
I also picked up a helmet - that was also on sale!
The sales woman was so nice, professional (knew her stuff) and guided me to exactly what I needed!
Loved this store - was broken hearted when the sales woman told me most people come in and try there stuff on - only to leave their store to find it on the internet cheaper!
Yuck!
People, lets support our local business's - this isn't a Nordstrom - I am pretty sure this is a family owned business!
Thank you Cindy and happy riding!
I will say the only negative thing is there location - it is a bit hard too see from the street - I wish for them (they had a more visable location).
Screw the internet - I like to try my stuff on and meet the nice, helpful people along the way!

I have been a customer since the mid '80s.
Best English tack shop in AZ, owner Jane never seems to change.
She's like Dick Clark.
If you want to deal with people who understand riding and showing and have been in the business for decades, go to Greenway.
