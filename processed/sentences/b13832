You know why I like Ace Hardware?
Because when I go in looking for:  -Machine Screws Pan Phillips 4-40 x 1/4....not only do they know what they are, they have them in stock!
More than 3!
(Lowe's sucks)  Because when I go in looking for:  --Small plastic parts boxes with dividers....they know what they are and I can buy one without also buying a freaking toolbox that it is inside!
(Lowe's sucks)  And speaking of Lowe's why do they only stock 3-5 of any particular item?
What if I want 7?
I need to visit 2 Lowes?

Helpful staff, way better than Lowes or Home Depot.
You can even find a great bargain if you are looking for it!

I came to Ace in search of some quality paint.
The service I received here was great.
The store was very clean.
The prices however seem to be higher than Home Depot.
