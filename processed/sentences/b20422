I've been to this place and it'snot exactly my favourite.
The food's rotton in the refectory.
When ever you ask for a roll w sausage or bacon etc you have to ask for the butter as the butter is not in the prepared roll.
They give you a wee scabby plastic knife to butter the roll with as well.
In the refectory you are not allowed to take a packed lunch, when i first heard that I thought wtf?
If you want decent lunch advice go home then return afterwards.
