I hate myself for reviewing Dominos, but I have to give props to this location for their awesome service and incredible speed.
A++++ service - friendly, helpful, and enjoyable.
Definitely not what you'd expect from a carryout chain pizza place.
The "all new" pizza that the commercials boast about tastes exactly like the "old" pizza to me.
Perhaps there's a bit more garlic flavor to the crust, but otherwise seems to be the same 'ole Dominos pie.
Pricey, too.
A 14" Brooklyn with 3 toppings and a pair of chocolate lava cakes was $25.
Ouch!!!
Same deal from Papa Johns would've cost $15.
I usually eat Dominos pizza about once every 2 years.
Even with the "all new" pizza, I don't think I'll be sampling with any more frequency.
Summary:  Service = 5 stars (awesome folks working here, seriously!
) Food = 2 stars (despite being "all new" it still tastes the same to me) Value = 1 stars (extremely pricey for take-out pizza) Misc = 5 stars (online ordering is the best system ever)
