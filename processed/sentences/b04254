I'm so glad by appointment with Nationwide got FUBARed.
Had it not, I wouldn't have ended up at Dr. Schrolucke's.
From the time I set my appointment, to the time I paid my tab, the staff was so friendly and nice, even good for a few laughs.
The doc himself seems to be a down-to-earth kind of guy, and I felt entirely comfortable throughout the whole exam.
Their office isn't the sleekest or most modern.
But it's comfortable and clean.
I didn't have to wait very long for my turn, and the whole exam went rather quickly.
Best of all, they didn't try to sell me some glasses I didn't need.
Gotta love that kind of honesty.

I was impressed, John really knows his stuff.
He is obviously a well educated optometrist who is passionate about his patient care.
If you live on the West side I would highly recommend John for your annual eye care exams.
These guys are light-years ahead of the national chain stores in service, quality, and training.
The only downside is that they don't have much of a selection of eye-wear.
(So just get your chic frames elsewhere, and have these guys put in the prescription lenses - FOR LESS MONEY).

He always does a good job and is personable.

I had always had 20/20 vision but over the last 5 years or so my eye sight has been deteriorating.
I just kept putting off going to an optometrist and a friend told me about John Schrolucke so I finally made an appointment.
I am very happy I went to John.
He is a smart individual who knows his stuff.
He gave me options and explained everything to me.
It feels so good to see the way I did years ago.
Everything is clearer and brighter thanks to John Schrolucke, O.D.
