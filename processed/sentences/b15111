This review is primarily for the car was that I use a couple times a month, though I do typically fill up here because I have some weird alliance to Chevron gas...
There is a no-touch car wash at this Chevron that is a pretty good deal.
It's a 4-5 minute, touchless wash that is only $8 for the top end wash.
I think you get a slight discount on gas if you purchase a wash, though the two have never overlapped for me.
I always get the $8, top end wash, and it does a good job.
You park in a stationary place and the machine moves around you, complete with wheel cleaners and a lot of soaps and rinses.
The dryers don't do a great job, so I bring a couple towels with me and park by the vacuums to get the excess water (of which there is a fair amount).
Vacuums are $1 in quarters, and gets you a few minutes.
Vacuum quality isn't anything to write home about, but it gets the job done.
This wash is also right across the street from Chipotle, so it's a great location for a lunch time car wash.

Painfully slow pumps.
Dirty store.

Stopped here to put gas in my car and got a car wash while I was at it.
Only had to wait a couple minutes to run my car through the drive-in wash, as there was a car ahead of me just finishing up with the rinse and then dry cycles.
My car came back very clean, surprising, since I only got the Express wash and that usually doesn't do the trick but is convenient and quick.
Later on, I did find one spot of bird droppings the car wash missed, but it happens.
I like Chevron's gas because it does seem like my car runs smoother using their Techron-formulated gas, rather than using the cheap, watered-down stuff some places in town offer.
I recommend using their brand, and if you haven't before, giving it a try and seeing what you think.
