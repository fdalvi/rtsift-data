Flair Boutique is a wonderful neighborhood store that offers a little bit of everything from speciality gifts to great clothes, jewelry, hats, purses, etc.
I like the uniqueness of this boutique.
The owners are very helpful and friendly.
I highly recommend checking out this boutique if you have not already!
