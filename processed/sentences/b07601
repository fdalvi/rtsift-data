Ok, here's the thing.....I grew up in Cleveland, Ohio eating Polish, German and Slovenian meat & sausage.
Best places back home to buy this kind of thing are on 185th Street, the ethnic "hood.
"   Moving to Phoenix meant lots of sunshine, no snow and no sausage like I was used to.
The closest I could find to home was Stanley's on Bell Road.
They have a wonderful selection and the girls smile every time I go in and ask, "Now how do you pronounce that?
"  My favorite is the rice sausage that's made with liver.
It is in a ring and bakes up great in the oven!
Short of making a trip back to Cleveland & 185th Street or the West Side Market, this is GOOD STUFF!
Do I shop there all the time?
Nope, but it's definitely the place to go to stock up for ethnic holiday types of meals, especially at Easter and Christmas time.
I stopped at Shreiner's last week on my way home from work and was a little dissappointed.
They were out of a lot of stuff, didn't even seem familiar with my favorites, but the young girl working there was very nice.
She told me they don't make the type of sausage I was looking for, but suggested I try some Brats.
Not exactly what I wanted, but I decided to try some.
They were okay, but for the really good, authentic ethnic sausage I love, I'll keep going to Stanley's!

Stanley's on Bell road has been evicted.
Drove out the weekend after turkey day and it is no longer open.
