Located on 67th ave. just north of Deer Valley, on west side of street.
This place is normally fairly clean, has a lot of customers, and has a good selection of stuff.
Only complaint is the darn loitering kids from the nearby school who dress like homeless hipster types.

I received an email stating that my photo order was ready for pickup at Walgreens store #4434.
On arrival, I was told that the order was not yet ready and that I would have to wait 20 mins because there was a large order being printed ahead of mine.
The photo clerk was very nonchalant and unapologetic about the situation.
When I spoke to 2 managers on duty, the only compensation I was offered was a 10% discount on my $2.90.
My time spent waiting was worth 29 cents to Walgreens.
Talk about adding insult to injury.
I will never shop at store #4434 ever again and I'm moving my prescription refills to a competitor.
I took the time to contact Walgreens' customer service about my experience and was told to expect a call back in 2 business days.
That never happened.
