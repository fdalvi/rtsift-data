Not one of my favorite Pawn Shops to browse when looking for stuff, but a few years ago I found a great deal on some golf clubs, so now I stop by here once a month 'just in case'.....  Needless to say, I've struck out ever since.
However, once you've hit gold, it's hard not to stop and see if there are any good deals.

I did not like this place at all.
The store was messy and the merchandise was horrible.
I don't know how they make any money off of selling stuff.
The staff was very rude and had little to no knowlege regarding jewelry.
I will never go back and I highly recommend driving south a few blocks to EZ Pawn.

Dont expect anyone to greet you here.
Not only will they not greet you, they will ignore you when you ask for help, EVEN WHEN THEY ARE NOT BUSY!
go down the street to EZ PAWN, this place has the worst customer service in any industry in VEGAS.

Time for an update....this was not one of my favorite joints.
However, over the past year or so, they've improved their product offering and we've found several pieces of jewelry at a great price here.
I no longer find golf clubs here, but the improvement in jewelry selection bumps them up 1 Star for me.
Service here is so/so, seems to change when they turnover employees.
