Jim Beam burger and sweet potato fries oh my so very good love this place and the best part they are going to have the biscuts like Hardees

Went through the drive-thru today-- got my friends the cod sandwich.
Several hours later, one friend had digestive problems.
I've gone there before without incident, but i'd double check to make sure the food is cooked enough.
Perhaps nuke it for a minute in the microwave at home to be safe.

I don't care who says Carl's is the least healthy fast food place.
Their double western burger, and criss-cut fries are legit!
I hate going into a fast food place and them giving me stale ice tea, but this location nailed it with a fresh batch.
Food came out fresh and fast, and my order was correct.
What else can you ask for out of a fast food place?

Horrible drive threw service.
They are always out of food and the wait time feels like forever.
They forgot most of my order half the time and had to go back to get and they wanted to give me the old stuff instead of making it new.
Then when we talk to the manager she didn't even care just said "ok" a lot.
