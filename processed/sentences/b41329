As far as airport bars go, this is fine.
Fairly generous portions on the beers, though the draft selection is minimal.
Instead of trying to create their own food, which would likely be a disaster like most airport restaurants, they have decided to offer food prepared by Nathan's and Jersey Mike's...probably a good idea.
I had a cheeseburger and fries.
Nice and greasy as you might expect.
Better than the other fast food options at Maccarran though.

The bar is small, but it wasn't very crowded so I stopped in for a pre-flight adult beverage.
There are only about 4 or 5 beers on tap, and a wine list with about 8 different choices.
The Sauvignon Blanc is decent, and for $9 this they pour a VERY generous portion.
Huge wine glass, filled at least half way, which I don't find typical of airport bars.
The service was fine, nothing to write home about, and they have a decent TV with, you guessed it, sports on.
There aren't many options in this terminal, and this one is pretty good.

The food and service was horrible!
I waited over 30 minutes for hot wings and they were cold by the time I got them.
The waitress did not even apologize for the mess up.
The beers are pricey.
It code $9 for a beer on tap.

Had the breakfast platter.
Food was edible but I can't say it was good.
I just covered it all in ketchup cause I was hungry.
For 2 people to have breakfast platter, 1 coffee, & 1 juice, total was $29.
Took 20 minutes to get check after we'd finished eating.
Took another 30 minutes to get someone to charge the card so we could leave!
Don't stop here if you're in ANY type of hurry!
