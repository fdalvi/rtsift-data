The great service, great food, and great bar are only surpassed by the best all-weather (covered and heated) patio in KW!
You can even catch some rays while you watch the game, because they have TVs on the patio too.
A nice bonus!
For food, definitely have the pot-stickers for starters, and you can't beat their steaks for dinner... and good luck picking a dessert that's NOT a great choice for an ending (my wife loves the white chocolate brownie).
It's even a hit for a family dinner...
There's lots of choice for the rug-rats, and my kids rave about the "volcano sunday" dessert.

Best pasta dishes in  KW.
The people there  try hard so have patience.
Wine list is dreadful.
All in all one of the better places in he area

Awesome food!
Awesome Service!
Awesome atmosphere!
I will be returning.

Great service from Allegra.
Had the grilled Fish Tacos and it was perfect for lunch!

My wife and I returned to Moxie's for my birthday.
We both agreed the calamari app was the best we've ever had!
They don't cut it in the normal ring that most places do.
Which really helps it stay moist while it cooks.
It is lightly battered and comes with a chili aioli for dipping.
It also has some lightly battered jalapenos and pickled ginger.
MMM I'm getting hungry again just thinking of it.
I order'd there Chop top lager on tap which I was warned that it was a very hoppy beer.
Unfortunately I didn't like it at all but my server had no issues replacing it for me with a different beer.
The service is top notch, the food is top notch and the menu is very reasonable.
2 beers(3 total but I wasn't charged for the ChopTop), 1 starter, and 2 entrees $77 plus tip.
On a side note the outdoor patio is heated for the cooler nights.
