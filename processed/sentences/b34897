This campus of Mesa Community College is great!
Staff is friendly and actively tries to help in any way they can.
Great job guys!

The people there are so nice and helpful.
Every time I go, Im in and out fast.
I chose to go to MCC Red mountain because of the friendly and professional environment there.
I highly recommend people go there.
