What a fun store!
I went in looking for one gift, left with two.
Chad was very helpful, and somehow injured all the merchandise.
Im glad I paid attention to the previous review and really spent my time looking around the whole store,  probably more than twice.
I found something new on each shelf, each time I looked.
And this was all in one visit.

Awesome local art, and unusual gifts.
Every time I go there there's something new to look at.
Take your time and look around, you never know what you find.

I'm a fan of unique gifts, I love taking the time and finding something that someone really likes vs. something that someone just "needs" I stumbled on to Whozitz and Whatzitz while another friend was purchasing, but now I'm addicted and go there when I need to find unique gifts that don't fit in proverbial box.
Plus I love friendly staff that guides you through the whole process, it is like shopping with a friend.
