This shop has everything for scrapbooking, card making, stamps and inks, beads and more.
The staff really know their stuff and surprisingly for a specialist shop its not expensive.
check them out if you're feeling creative on the run up to Christmas.
So sad but this shop is now gone.

As you walk along Portobello High Street one shop which certainly has the ability to catch anybody's eye is Get Creative!
From the outside it has a large bright blue canvass cover which hangs over the front of the shop, which displays it's name in a sort of Art Attack sort of way.
Inside, the shop is full of stationary, paints, arty stuff and many things which would entertain any kid's art class.
This certainly is not your typical stationary shop, indeed it is more than that, and it focuses on providing products for arts and crafts.
The shop is bright and colourful inside, which adds to its character.
The staff were very friendly and seemed to have a passion for the creative arts that the store specialises in.
Prices are also very reasonable also for pens, pencils, your normal stationary items.
A great little shop and a great find!
