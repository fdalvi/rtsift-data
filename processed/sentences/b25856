Wonderful staff, Rosy is a pleasure to encounter and my family has always received quality service from her Pharmacy.
A friendlier, more personal pharmacy experience that keeps us coming back.

My family swithced to Rosy's over a year ago and we have never had a better experience with a Pharmacy.
Rosy and her staff are wonderful!
I would encourage anyone who lives close enough to experience what real customer service feels like.

I love this pharmacy.
The staff is corteous, friendly and they know what they are doing.
customer service is A+.
It's a business you enjoy visiting.

Great service plus they speak English ans Spanish.
My parents really love that .

They provide really great personal attention that you wouldn't get at a big pharmacy.
Plus I can walk there.
