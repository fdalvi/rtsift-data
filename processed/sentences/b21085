I have a predisposition toward liking post offices.
Coming from a village where the post office was a central part in the community, I understand how important it can be, and the affects its removal can have.
But Edinburgh still have a number going strong.
One of these is West Maitland Post Office, just off the West End of Princes St. Basically it does what it's supposed to.
It delivers, it receives, it provides essential items for postal.
It's not  the biggest Post Office so its services will obviously be limited, but for its size it does well.
There was nothing mind blowing about the service I received when I sent a parcel and bought some stamps, but it was a pleasant service and perfectly adequate.
No complaints.
Keep up the good work!

It's a post office, there isn't much to say.
But the staff are pretty friendly and very helpful.
I got what I wanted posted so job done.
Overall, a decent post office, can't really complain.
I only went there because I needed to, but I will go again.
