The dumbasses sold me the wrong size intake hose because they didn't have the right size in stock.
I bought a fancy hydraulic jack there and while it was great for awhile the thing broke shortly afterwards.

The service and knowledge of the staff is so poor I moved my shop's commercial account to a different location.
Constant screw ups.
And if you go in the counter person will invariably have no idea what you need and will have to ask an absent coworker for help.
Even when I call with THEIR part number they can't get it right.
Pathetic.

Poor customer service.
Waited in line with 5 other customers, while 5 employees didn't even acknowledge one single customer.
One of them was the store manager.
His name was Ruben.
This place is a joke.
