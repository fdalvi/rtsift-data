I would rather walk my parcel to its destination than visit this location ever again.
The woman I dealt with (Mary Jo) was horribly rude.
She gave me the ultimatum of paying for an extra service that was NOT necessary or taking my box to USPS, which was already closed.
If I didn't have to get the box out that day, I would have kindly told her to shove her packing material up her external orifice responsible for defecation.

Will only be scheduling pick ups if it means coming to this location.
The older lady working there is so rude and not helpful at all.
