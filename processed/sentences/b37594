The Skylark has a really nice, laid back feel to it.
I wish their food was better, though, as the dishes I had just didn't quite hit the mark.
Portobello has a number of good little places, and this is one to add to that list, but it's perhaps better just to pop in for a coffee or a drink.
Overall, we said: "I thought that The Skylark had real potential, particularly as a relaxing Sunday afternoon spot, as the place has a smart and understated charm.
However, the food needs marked improvement.
It was just all too meek for its own good.
It was rather reminiscent of Cafe Milk, in that regard.
With a significant dose of chutzpah, they could develop a really attractive offering.
For now, there are other places in this neighbourhood that make a better case for meriting a visit.

Could be such a nice place if the management and staff stood back and thought about it.
As you walk in you are given a blank expression as if what the hell are you doing here?
I take a seat and try and grab a member of staffs attention but fail, there are four members of staff and l can't understand why they simply can't work together as a team.
The server guy comes along and points to the wall saying the specials are over there than telling me what they are as l can't see the specials board as there is a pillar in the way.
I had the chai latte with a club sandwich.
In total all that took an hour and a half where in the real world it should have take less than 30 minutes.
A second visit at a later date might secure a 3rd star.
