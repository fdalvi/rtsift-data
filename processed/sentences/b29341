I followed a trainer from another gym here and I took her Saturday 8AM class and what a wonderful workout I got, a class that you burn the fat and boy I felt like the fat was burning all day.
I get really bored at a regular gym so I love Group Training with variety of exercises which included on my workout which of course they would change ropes, jumping, burpees and so much more.
What I love is the trainer motivating us during the workout.
At times since I am out of shape I wanted to stop, but the trainer was behind me pushing me and that helped me get through the workout.
The gym is really big with high ceilings and a lot of room for big classes.
They even have an area for sports performance training which I am excited to get my daughter to get involved in since she is in soccer and this added training would be good for her.
The Group Training classes currently are M-F 6AM and 11AM and Saturdays at 8AM.
They will be adding more classes.
There is plenty of parking.
You have to check them out!

State of the art facility with knowledge staff.
Trevor and Brian tailored a strength and conditioning program specifically for our Rugby Club.
Thanks for kicking my butt and pushing limits today.
See you again soon.

I have been training here for a couple of weeks now, and I have to say that this facility is fantastic, state of the art, with extremely knowledgeable and friendly staff.
I went in with some serious back issues and Trevor has already helped me tremendously.There isn't a sign when you're trying to find it, so you have to look a bit, but it's definitely worth it.
They offer a lot of services, from personal training to sports performance training, and everything in between.
The facility is nice and clean.
The nice thing about a place like this is that you're getting personal attention, knowledge, and not dealing with those horribly crowded gyms.
I have to say I'm a big fan of this place.
Definitely make it a point to check them out!
