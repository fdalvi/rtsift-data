Kanopy dance studio is beautiful; spacious, mirrored, well lit, view of state street.
I love taking capoeira classes here.
The capoeira class is excellent and from what I can tell, their other classes, ballroom, ballet, tango, salsa, belly dance, are all high quality.
They even offer an african drumming class.
awesome.
come dance.

Kanopy is THE place for dance training in Madison, particularly modern and ballet dancing.
The teachers know their stuff.
Ever heard of Martha Graham?
She's only the greatest modern dance legend to exist, and the Graham classes are "heady" (you use your noodle) and also extremely physical, so you get that dancer physique.
Kanopy also has a professional dance company that performs regularly at the Overture Center, so check Overture for the latest shows.

Great dance spaces here.
I've been going to Tango lessons with Joe from Madison Tango for weeks and weeks.
Learning so much.
The studio is divided into a few parts so there are a few classes happening at once.
For instance, it also has some crazy Brazilian thing happening.
Never smelled such sweat in my life, except for...  nevermind.
Anyway, it's a great studio.
Go there and learn some things!
