The place is conveniently next to the gym.
Great place if you are looking to drop off a lot of stuff I popped in one day and decided to find out how much they charged and wow..
Very cheap.
I didn't see any reviews so I only dropped off two of my dress shirts.
The gal there told me to come back the next day after 3pm.
FAST.
I came back and my shirts were clean and pressed.
Nothing wrong with any of my shirts.
I asked her if they did the pressing themselves, but they said that it was sent off to another place.
For the price, I didn't care.
Side note, they do alterations as well

Price for cleaning is awesome, 3 shirts and a pair of pants was under 10 bucks, AAAAAND its ready the next day, the place I went to in the past used to charge a little extra for that.
Awesome.
