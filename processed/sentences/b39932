Funke yoga is a relatively new yoga studio to Old Town Scottsdale, but it is NOT "Scottsdale".
The owner, Mara, is very friendly and welcoming and so are the teachers.
Every time I've been to a class there the teacher has always taken the time to help me adjust my pose to get the most benefit.
I'm not flexible AT ALL so it's always nice to have someone show me how I can still get the stretch in without being able to touch my toes.
I really like restorative yoga, it's an hour practice of deep stretching.
Perfect for me since I run and I know I never stretch as much as I should!
Plus, I work in a nonprofit so I get 10% off!

My favorite class is with Kerry on Sunday!
My back was KILLING me one afternoon and I went to restorative yoga and Kerry taught me poses that took all the pain away!
It was amazing!
The owner, Mara, is very personable, positive, and has great customer service skills.
I have two friends who have never done yoga so she gave me two coupons for them, each was a buy one get one.

I have been doing yoga regularly for 7+ years and have sampled many of the Phoenix area studios.
I LOVE Funke Yoga for being down-to-earth, real humans.
The owner, Mara, is so friendly and welcoming and the studio itself invites you to make yourself at home.
I took my 50-something year old dad to his first yoga class ever and it was perfect.
The class completely served me as a "seasoned" yoga participant, at the same time being the perfect class for my dad who knew absolutely nothing about yoga.
Danielle is an amazing teacher!
I definitely recommend the studio - I live in downtown Phoenix and it is worth the drive!
