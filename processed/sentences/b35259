Best place to grab a bite or drink to escape the heat!
Try their halo-halo...
I think it's the best in town.

I was pretty stoked to learn about a Goldilocks store near my place but wound up disappointed when we entered the store.
Severely lacking of entrees to choose from and their baked goods are limited as well.
Prices are a bit on the high side.
Might as well go to Seafood City to buy Goldilocks pastries - generally a few cents cheaper.
Lady behind the counter wasn't too pleasant nor helpful.
Off day perhaps?
Maybe I'm just spoiled with other Goldilocks chain stores in California.
I will check out the other one at Henderson though.
Hopefully that location is much better.

Always a great source of Filipino food.

It's like being home.
Sarap Pinoy food.
