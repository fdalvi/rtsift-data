$$$ but very flashy n trendy stuff here...good for 20-30 yr olds

Cute clothing at The Mirage.
Good brands and a huge sale section.
Great for a cheap, trendy option if you want something new to wear.

Great designer clothing section without even walking into a big crowded mall and they have pretty good deals in the back of the store that are 50% - 70% off.
Customer service here is excellent, the sales guy would always check if I was finding everything ok. You can't miss this store when your going or leaving the pool to your hotel room.

Bought a formal dress and a cocktail dress here, but wanted to buy the whole store.
The people who work here were friendly and helpful.
The store is clean and carries a wide variety.
Expensive.

The customer service in this cute boutique was AMAZING.
We originally went into the store to just kill some time and try on some things and take some cute pictures.
Vicki was so tolerant, friendly, and helpful even though we were obviously just browsing.
I did, however, buy the most fabulous dress.
Their prices are very reasonable for the quality.
I would highly recommend.
A special thanks to Vicki!
