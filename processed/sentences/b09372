Jeff:  This is where we take the van before every tour.
Tom personally inspects and does all the repairs.
He is honest, gives a fair price and is an all around nice guy.
Tom always remembers you and your vehicle history and that rules.
Chris:  I take my car here whenever I need anything done.
He's very honest and tells you what needs to be done or what can wait.
Looking for a guy you can trust?
Tom's your man.
As a bonus he has a killer stash.
Ryan:  I've never been there but I've heard good things.
I don't have a car and I don't live in Arizona.

Been having Tom service our cars for years now.
He provides excellent service, is completely honest, and has a fair price.
He went way above the call of duty once helping us with a dispute when we mistakenly took a car, due to convenience, to another shop.
Cannot recommend Tom highly enough.
