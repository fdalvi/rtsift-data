Look out!
The nice girls on the phone are a cover for the worst billing nightmares which will plague you!
They randomly charge you and say 'oh well', it was a mistake.
In the meantime, bounced check charges are not covered.
Also, they left a not-cool box on the drive after I moved and the next people could not move into the house as the driveway was blocked.
I lost my deposit for not returning the property in a timely fashion.
They never returned my call re:  why they 'forgot' to pick up the pod.
Stay away!
No one can be this bad!
You will lose money with them.
One star is too much.

I can only say that this is a bait and switch scheme.
They will say anything to get you to use them and then not honor what they say.... they are poorly trained and couldn't quote you the same thing twice if their life depended on it.
They are sure to make guarantees that they cannot keep and they have additional charges every time you turn around.
This company is not one anyone should do business with.
There are many other reputable companies that offer the same products and even though they may appear to be a bit higher believe me they aren't.
This company will try and bleed you dry every time you turn around
