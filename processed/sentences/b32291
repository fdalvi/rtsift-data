Awesome staff!
Very family oriented.

Professional, friendly....and efficient!
Nurse Practioner: Theresa is very compassionate and caring..can't say enough about Dr. Strebel"s staff..'.they care about their patients!!!!

Dr. Strebel has been my Dr for 8 yrs.
He has delivered 2 of my 4 kids.
I had a high risk pregnancy and loss with my 3rd child.
Dr. Strebel was amazing during the loss of our daughter.
He helped us understand the risk and helped us make the decisions we had to during my 3rd pregnancy.
His staff was wonderful with assisting us with appointments and setting up dates to deliver our daughter.
There are many Dr's in Las Vegas I have been to quite a few and Dr's Strebel and Theresa are 2 people I would trust 150%.
Dr. Strebel has delivered my last Daughter as well.
If I have any questions at all they are right there to help and answer.
Never making me feel dumb or silly for calling.
If something is too technical for me to understand they will explain everything to me so that I understand completely what is going on.
I could not say enough in this review as to how wonderful they are!
I recommend him to everyone!

So far I've had a great experience at this office.
The staff is very friendly.
The drs are compassionate, understanding and thorough.

Dr Strebel has been my doc 7 years and has delivered 2 of my babies.
He and his office staff are always very attentive, caring and swift.
I recently underwent surgery with the doc at sunrise hospital.
He called several times to check on me after.
Even the nurses remarked on how impressed they were with how much he was concerned and the level of care he showed me.
I am always able to get through to his nurse Blanca and after surgery Dr Strebel answered my calls personally!
Even on the weekend and Memorial Day.
Would never dream of changing Ob/GYN's.
There's nobody better!!
