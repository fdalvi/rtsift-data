Not only is their ice cream homemade and delicious but they also have amazing lunch and dinner options.
Seriously - the boysenberry caramelized onions are amazing!
I also just found out that they offer fundraisers - hello!
awesome!
Oh and they were just awarded Best Of Our Valley 2011 !
Great job guys!

Heck yes!
This place is what Yelp is all about.
I came here a few weeks ago on a sort of vacation in the desert.
Depending on the Yelp app alone, I found this ice cream shop but all it had was one 3 year old review!
Never the less, it looked great and it was right in the area I happened to be in already.
Having had a long week in hot weather, nothing sounded better than an ice cream sundae - for lunch!
But it gets better!
They actually serve food in addition to sundaes, shakes and ice cream.
So while all I had initially wanted was a big ass sundae, I found myself also ordering a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
I believe it was locally made peanut butter and then there were at least 5 options of jelly/jams and even honey.
WIth a black and white checkered floor, wrought iron tables and chairs, a few booths, and even a stage set up for live music, this is quite the hoppin' spot!
Nestled right downtown I imagine it's a real staple for Wickenburg.
In fact, in the 5 days I was there I actually went back twice.
Definitely a must-see spot in W-burg.

Delicious prickly pear and boysenberry although a little too sweet.
Live music.
Comfortable.
