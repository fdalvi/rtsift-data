AEO is pretty standard.
Some of the pieces can be pretty boring, admittedly.
However, I've been shopping here for almost a decade now, and the tops fit me very well, so I see no reason to stop now!
Love their basic tank tops, they're ribbed and slimming and hold their color well.
I also have several pairs of leather sandles and sundresses that I love.
All in all, a good place to go if you want to look cute, all-American and laid-back.

This store offers anything from laid back and relaxed to chic and sophisticated clothing.
Whether you are the girl next door, the sporty one, or the party one, you most definitely find something that will fit your tastes!
Did I also mention that there is no need to worry about sizing issues as they cater to every body type!
The best part about this store is that you can look nice without spending an arm and a leg.
The ambience is upbeat with music playing in the background and the employees make  your visit pleasant by being attentive to the customer's concerns and needs at all times.
I would definitely recommend this store if you are looking for something to buy to wear but are just not sure exactly what you want.
You will find style inspiration from the various mannequins displayed across the store.
The only reason I gave this place four stars instead of five is because they tend to repeat their clothing styles in between seasons and it can get a bit boring, but if you are willing to wait a while in between seasons  you will likely find new styles.
I definitely give this store a thumbs up!

It's a Mall and it's a typical AE shop.
Service was great as I was greeted with a smile and asked by staff if I needed assistance.
Always great clothing and they had plenty in my size.
