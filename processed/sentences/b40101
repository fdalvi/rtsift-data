such a nice little place.
cozy embient.
spent 30 bucks for a whole foot massage spa package, well worth the money!
love to come back next time in town.

Today I definitely got my moneys worth and more.
I had purchased a coupon from Living Social so I am always willing to give something a try at a discount.
I was expecting a pleasant foot and hand massage- but what I got was a full body massage (clothes on) that really got all the kinks out.
When you close your eyes, you would imagine you were being worked on by a fit Swede or Russian woman- and not a nice little Chinese woman, who I believe was the owner.
Sometimes you get people that are just rubbing- but this lady put her all into me having a great experience.
I will be going back with my hubby for the couples massage.
You cant beat it- even at their regular prices.
I gave her a better tip- as I hadn't gotten a rub so good from any of the many other places in town that charged 3 times the price.
I left feeling great from the top of my head to my feet.
It is a clean and pleasant place and friendly staff- although the English is spotty.
Just go and try it- you wont be disappointed!

Love this place, have been here 3x's already.
Very friendly and great experience every time.
They are consistent and worth every dollar.
It is located in a retail center which tends to be busy during the day, so opt to come in the evening when the area is quiet.
Definitely making it a monthly date :-)

long over due review.
been here 2 times.
and plan on going back a few more.
the staff is AWESOME!!!!!.
very very nice , massages outstanding.
get the full body 90min $60 worth every penny.

My sister in law and I came here expecting just a foot massage.
We said we wanted the 1 hour massage and ended up getting a 1 hour full body massage for $30.
So worth it.
Sally and Coco did a great job, always smiling, and knows exactly how much pressure is needed.
Will be back soon.
