l called Bruce to have him fix the trim that was damaged during the new a/c unit install.
And he was able to come out in two days and repaired and painted it.
We were very happy with his work.
Thank you.

Bruce is very knowledgable about everything.
He fixes all the little stuff.
He does excellent work on your "honey do list"

I never hesitate giving out Bruce's name & info to others when people are in need of a handyman.
The job is always done right.
I do follow up with my referrals & his new customer are always thankful they found A-1 Hand Handyman.
