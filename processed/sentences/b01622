Great atmosphere, free drinks, and kind staff.

Love my Dentist and Hygienist!!!
I started going here in 06.
They were my 1st  choice because they were right next to where I worked at that time.
So it was easy to go there over my lunch.
Now in 07, I moved to Seattle and back to Phoenix in 08.
Even though I live clear across town about 20-25 mins drive, I still would never go to another dentist.
Besides the great service which I have become accustomed to, they also have video games in the waiting room (when I have my 10 yr old nephew), flats screens in the back, and of course those awesome cookies, with juice and water in the fridge waiting for you afterwards!
I've never waited too long before any appointment.
I typically get there right on time, and they are ready for me.
Love them, Love them, Love them.
I always have the same Hygienist too.
I feel like I'm going to see an old friend.
This is as good as it gets.
