Five girls show up in the middle of a Saturday wanting matching tattoos- Z and Charles helped us find the symbol we wanted, sized each one for us, since we all wanted it in different areas.
We were all in and out within an hour and treated very well.
The place was clean and the staff friendly.
Highly recommend!

This place was ok.I came here a few years back.
I had to get a tattoo on my birthday weekend.
I got my daughters names on the back of my biceps for $250.
It was ok.
I am redoing them now.
The guy dug into my skin.
My wifes was a free hand touch up on her back.
also for $250.
That came out much better.

Made an appointment to get my first tattoo.
Tattoo artist Jason did an awesome job.
I provided the basic idea and let him design the rest.
Job took around 5 hours to complete.
Jason aka 'Bully' played music on the shops computer to help pass the time and keep my mind off the pain from the needle.
Wasn't sure what to expect since it was my first, but very pleased with the result.
See picture to see what I got done..it was a Randy Rhoads Jackson guitar impaled into my leg like an arrow.
