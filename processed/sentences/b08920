I have had terrible vision most of my life so I can appreciate the professional service from the crew here.
As a parent, you will know the protective nature of always seeking the best care for your children and I place full trust and confidence here.
The selecton of eyewear - glasses and sunglasses - even suitable for an Asian-fit....what can I say....I have lived a lifetime hoping I would grow a decent bridge..!!
Only to find some decent eyewear suited to my little nub :)

Very nice staff.
Good experience my first time there.

My wife and I have been going to Dr. Stipek for over 10 years now.
He's terrific.
A truly nice man that really knows his business.
He's relaxed, friendly and happy to answer any silly question you have.
As you'll find with any good doctor, his office staff is exactly the same.
From the front desk to the opticians you're treated like a friend here.

My husband and I have been going to Dr. Stipek for over 10 years.
He is a very thorough doctor and we always feel a sense of relief after our exam and all is good because we have such confidence in him.
His front office staff has been with him for years and are experts on the insurance and billing end of things.
The selection of eyewear is excellent.
Highly recommend Dr. Stipek and his team if you are new in town and/or looking for excellent eye care.

While working in the Scottsdale area I found that my glasses nose pieces had fallen off from my frames.
Although I did not buy from this optician, they fixed me right up and at no charge.
Truly nice people and I really appreciated their customer service ethics.
I highly recommend them based upon my positive experience.

Dr Stipek and his entire staff are absolutely wonderful, they genuinely care about their patients and take the time to ensure everything is done right.
The exam given by Dr. Stipek is the most thorough  I have ever received and this includes exams from both optomistrists and ophthalmologists.
Highly recommended!
