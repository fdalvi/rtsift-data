Received a quote 9300 or so for 11 window ($500.00 per window or so) and 2  sliding doors($1500 per door or so).
Sales guy seemed legit, I even went to the warehouse to check out manufacturing, sounded great.
I knew I was pay a little more than just buying at home depot and having a friend install.
The reason I didn't was because the "lifetime" warranty closed the deal.
Pay a little more to have full warranty, make sense, right?
I decide to move forward on the doors only to test the company.
Glad I did.
Install was OK, was happy they were laying my new door frames on everything except a drop cloth.
I was able to get over that.
Handles are loose, locks are loose, molding not fitting perfect, they cut the vinyl to get the door to fit right.
The rolling mechanism in one door makes a noise.
Realizing I didn't receive foot lock which I was told were a part of the deal.
Made a call then 5+ more calls to the sales rep., 3 call to main office, still chasing them around to this day.
All this to receive...hold on folks... a "LIMITED" Lifetime Warranty, yep that's right limited.
That's a big difference from Lifetime.
Thank god I didn't give them 9k.
Next time I'll hire my buddy (GC) to get the job done.
super frustrated, I researched, checked 5 companies out, and end up pick these guy, oh what a fool I am.

the sliding glass windows they installed in my new custom home were of very poor quality.
when we expressed our dissatisfaction they said the waves in our glass were normal for tempered glass.
The windows in their showroom that we looked at were not wavy.
Our glass looks almost like the glass from a funhouse!
