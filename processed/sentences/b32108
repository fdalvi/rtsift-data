Love the Live Music.

my caprese sandwich was decent, but it took half an hour to get our food... seems a bit much considering there were all of eight patrons in the whole place.
kind of pricy for a sandwich, but i'm glad that there's a non-fast food lunch option in the area.
the outdoor seating is nice, too.

They went out of business.
