If you've never heard of Brighton or brush it off whenever you pass their store in the mall, then know this; they've got great gift ideas for that special lady or ladies in your life.
They just don't sell jewelry, they also sell bags, broaches and other popular gift items.
The offerings are understated but classy.
Smaller items are more affordable but still pack a punch in the thought department.
The younger ladies in your life may not be a fan of this style but the more mature ladies will.
Gentleman, this review is for you.
If you want to let your mom, sis or aunt know just how classy she is, then you owe it to them to pick something up from here.
The sales staff at all Brighton stores, not just the Chandler location, are pros and can lead you in the right direction.
And you know Christmas is right around the corner.
Tis the season...

I love Brighton Jewelry and this is the worst Brighton store I have  ever been in.
They never have the latest styles.
The staff are very rude and don't want to assist anyone.
I have ordered two different items from them and never received either item nor a call back about the items.
I will never step foot in this store again.
Looking forward to the new Gilbert- San Tan Brighton store.
This one should at Chandler mall should just close their doors and go out of business.
