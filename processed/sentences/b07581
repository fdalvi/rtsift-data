Visiting from out of town.
Was amazed at the selection at this store.
My personal interest is model rockets, so I was pleased at the selection,  There are also a lot of plastic models and an extensive arts and crafts section.
The employees were helpful and courteous.
Good experience

I was more interested in their art supply selection and most of what they had was student grade.
They did have a large selection of model pieces if that is what you are looking for.
I'm sure I will be back for little things like pencils and erasers.
On a different note, when my husband and I were walking around and checking stuff out, there was some gentleman who kept following us through every aisle.
I'm thinking to make sure we don't steal.
This was extremely weird though and made me feel a little uncomfortable.
Maybe they should just install security cameras like everyone else.

Visiting from Hawaii and stopped at this store.
great selection on plastic cars/ships/airplanes model kit.
Lots of RC Airplanes hanging above the store.

Great selection of RC cars and model cars.
I went in wanting to purchase a model Spanish ship not knowing it took years to build, ended up not getting it since I do not have the patience for all the detailed assembly.
I ended up with a RC car that I paid about $450 for and broke it on the second use.
I went In for a second time and none of the same staff from the original visit was there except for the cashier.
Guy who helped me find the part I needed was a little irritated w/ me since I didn't know the name of the part I was looking for ( I don't know that nerdy kinda ish) but ended up selling me all upgraded parts.
I'm an easy sell but was a little irritated with that specific guy,everyone else was cool as ice.
You won't be disappointed with their selections of neat stuff.
Forgot to tell you that I've wanted a RC car since I was a kid and the one I purchased goes about 60 MPH!
