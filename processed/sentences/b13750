After multiple horrific experiences at Southwest Dental, this place was a godsend.
This place is definitely caring, compassionate, and listens to the patients' concerns.
Would recommend to anyone, especially those who have had a prior bad dental experience.

In my opinion, going to the dentist is never on my list of things I want to do.
However, I LOVE Gilbert Family Dentistry!
Hands down I always have such a positive experience.
Now, although I sill would rather spend my afternoon outside of the dental office, they make my experience great!
Yesterday I had an appointment and the hygienist was able to squeeze me in a little early!
What?!?
I was so happy to get in on time for my appointment.
Also, she kept me informed throughout the appointment and was able to thoroughly clean my teeth and schedule my appointment in a timely fashion!
Dr. Haslam is great and I strongly suggest you check out this dental office!
They Rock!

Love this office!
I work in the dental field in speciality and this office is great!
Doctor is very honest and down to earth and his staff is super friendly.
Couldn't say anything bad about them.
