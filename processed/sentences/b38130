"Moe and Freeman's 1 st stay at boarding.
This is a regular boarding facility, so if your pet has to have a doggie spa or some useless pampering then this is not for you.
However if your looking for clean play yards and clean pens with caring sitters then Hope's camp is for your pet.
We will be back.
The price was a bargain and the care great.

I've boarded my dog at Hope's many times.
These people love dogs, are good people and will do whatever it takes to make your pet safe, secure, and happy.
The kennel is clean and secure and I don't have any worries when my good girl stays with Michelle and Brett.
Before you call be sure your pet's shots are up to date and that you have the records, another plus for these guys.
Your dog will be among dogs with responsible owners.

Michele and Brett are both caring, responsible, knowledgeable and fun!
They remembered our dogs and their quirks after our first boarding there, and now we won't use anyone else.
From the way our Shih Tzu and Bichon played with the two owners, we could tell our dogs had had a great time and knew they were in the hands of people who liked them!
Before our first reservations, we dropped into the kennel without advance notice and the place was very clean and dogs were romping in the open area on schedule.
Another customer was there apparently in the middle of a family crisis that required indefinite boarding of some pets.
Michele was a reasonable voice reassuring the family that they at least wouldn't have to worry about their pets.
We are so glad to have discovered Hope's!
