They did a poor job of both washing and waxing my car.
I guess when you are the only game in town... it's like they weren't even trying.
DIY or wait to wash unitil drive to Chandler for supplies, not worth your time or money.

Way too much money to have someone rush threw your car do a poor job it was not fully dry inside was very poor it's the only one in town for now so we have very limited choices just stay away and hope Maricopa gets new car wash

Yes!
I believe these guys earned their five stars.
They cleaned my car inside and out.
They cleaned it quickly and they cleaned it well and for a grand total of $20!
I will be returning frequently.
