Thrilled that they carry Zico and GTs Kombucha!

This Safeway always has vagrants out front.
Very sketchy and somewhat dangerous.
My wife and I were threatened with a knife while waking to our car in the parking lot.
I would advise anyone and everyone to avoid this Safeway at all cost.

Bummer.
They no longer carry GTs Kombucha.

This store is close to me, but have always been more expensive than Fry's.
The store itself is clean and well organized, but the biggest issue I have is the number of cashiers working.
Every time I go in there,  only one cash register is open, out of seven, wait times are pretty long.
They should have a self check out option.
Or at least 2 registers open.
