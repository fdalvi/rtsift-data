'Wow, you make this stuff yourself' I uttered to Joey D after having a peek at his self made edgy urban garments.
The clothes here are recycled from vintage clothing and unusual materials resulting in some truly original clothing.
It's a marmite affair, though, some items will either inspire you or have you wincing at the thought of donning such attire.
Joey, the designer and shop owner is a charming and inviting chap an undoubtedly after having a chat with this talented fellow his enthusiasm will rub off onto you, persuading you to consider buying some of the unique styles on offer.
A great alternative to the mainstream clothing shops.

Sometimes I wish I was alternative enough and 'boho' enough to be able to wear this sort of thing.
The stuff they stock here is definitely not for the mainstream high street shopper, and more for the 'Kate Moss ain't got sh*t on me, I set my own trends' sort of people.
In other words, it's a bit of an acquired taste.
A lot of the stuff you look at, and even though you think it looks ok, you can't think of a single time in anyone's life where it would be appropriate to wear it.
Don't get me wrong, it's a great place to go and have a browse even if it's not on your way or you're not in the area.
It's jut that, in my case, I definitely am one of those boring people who's perfectly fine with what Princes Street has to offer.
