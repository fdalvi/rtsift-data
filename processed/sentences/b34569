Ask for Lupi she is a great stylist.
Has been cutting my hair since I moved to Vegas

Doesn't get any better.
Ask for Allison.
Go BEAVERS!

All in all, not too bad.
It was a litte busy due to our poor planning, but the service was good and my daughter was pleased with the haircut.
Other similar places are a little less expensive for the same service.
Nothing was really outstanding, but there is also nothing to complain about either.
