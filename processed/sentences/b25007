Brian with Man Cave Entertainment shares this spot with On Site Satellite.
I have now purchased 3 Vizio TV's from Brian now.
He has the best prices and advertises on Craigslist.
Whatever the price at Costco is for the same TV, he drops the price by at least $100.
All TV's are returns or refurbished and he sells them with a 6 month warranty or you can buy a cheap 5 year in home warranty.
I highly recommend doing some homework on which Vizio you want to buy and then stop in this place so you know the deal you are getting.
Now he only sells Vizio LCD sets and they are a great TV.

Nice place, ask for Fred he is very nice and knowledgeable.

We just moved to town and I couldn't get my satellite receiver to work.
I made a phone call to this company and he patiently talked me thru it.
Within a few minutes, I was back up.
Excellent customer service.
I will remember this company if we ever need in-home service or to make a purchase.
Thank you so much!
