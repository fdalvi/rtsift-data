This is the new location of the Winchell's that was on Decatur and Washington.
This new larger location is next to Cardenas and shares a store with Subway.
It's new, shiny and clean.
We stopped in at 9 p.m. on a Sunday night and the donut case was filled with freshly baked donuts...I was in chocolate heaven!
The best news?
They're open 24 hours!

When I saw the old school Winchell's across the street was closing I was sad.
I had gone there since I was little.
It was after 9 pm and I had a craving for donuts.
I figured why not give the newer location across the street a try?!
Upon walking in I was super stoked to see there was also a Subway inside.
To the left is the Winchell's and to the right is Subway.
The inside is very clean and I was greeted when entering the store.
I was surprised how busy they were at that hour.
There was several customers eating sandwiches and donuts.
I guess they weren't on the "Subway Diet"!
They have daily specials.
There was a easy to read board with what they were offering that day.
As tempting as the deal for the cute little mini donuts was I chose the regular assorted dozen.
I was impressed with the selection.
It cost $8.99.
The smell of the donuts on my lap for the ride home was crucial.
We really enjoyed every donut!
We will be back for sure!

We stopped here for lunch to get Subway.
We were tired and hungry and sort of in shitty moods.
I love donuts...and seeing Winchell's inside of a Subway caught me off guard, for one never seen a donut shop inside of a Subway...and second never heard of Winchell's period.
The donuts were fresh, plump and full of sugary, doughy goodness.
They were great, and it was nice to have something different for a change instead of the double D's.
