Okay so let me start by saying I am a very picky person and probably the worst customer a company could come across.
I say this with all sincerity when it comes to my hair I can be and usually am a total monster.
Well tonight I had the best by far experience at this salon than I have ever had.
When Annie, my stylist, showed me my hair to my surprise it looked better than any other stylist has even got close to making it look.
I was lost for words it was that great.
Angela the owner and Annie the hair genius were amazing they are not just great at what they do they are also very cool people and I have found a place that I will from this day forward always be a loyal customer.
I highly recommend this shop and that means a whole lot coming from a customer-zilla like myself.
Oh and they have great prices what else could you ask for?

Not a good experience.
I'm done with Russian, Kazakh, etc.
hair cutters.
They ask how you want it cut & cut it as they want.
I've been to Classic, V's, NY Hair and now this one.
The process is to use a clipper and shear you like a sheep.
I specifically stated I wanted my hair trimmed up and thinned, not cut short.
Short I got.
Ironically I was asked if it had been cut too long!!!
The haircut lasted less than 10 minutes of furious activity.
Not my kind of shop.

Ilya was my barber for my couple visits here.
Quick hair cut, not too much conversation which I don't mind.
He works with his mom who is the owner, very nice lady.
Never a long line which is always a plus.
Only thing I wish they played music or had tvs.
