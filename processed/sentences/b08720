For some reason, I am able to get more work done at this place than any library, Starbucks, or at my own house.
The music is loud and the lighting is a little off-kilter, but it just wakes up the productivity in me.
The coffee is good, and there are a couple of pool tables tucked away in the corner.
If you're looking for a place to hide away with headphones and a book, here's your spot.

COffee,Beer, And wine?!
Oh my!
Heres where I met Honey ginseng....I've forgotten about the other teas in my life....  ok great coffee and tea selection.....but I asked for a wine list they didn't have one.....I asked for a Pinot Noir.....they didn't have one......grrr...there where also out of food...which was my quest at the time....  ok and there urinal situation has to be looked at.....ones right by the sink, the others just 90 degress on another wall?
