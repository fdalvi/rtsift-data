I was instantly attracted to this shop by all the antiques lined up in the window.
The brooches and gorgeous porcelain ladies galore made my eyes bulge in awe.
It's very small, but utterly brimming with stock.
It makes me feel like I'm in someone's attic, it's very personal.
The collection ranges from old 1920s pocket mirrors to beautifully binded books, with nouveau inspired flowers running up the spine.
The woman stationed behind the desk is absolutely lovely, and although it is an intimate setting she leaves you free to browse without badgering you to buy.
The brooch collections are surprisingly cheap and she has a box full of antique postcards.
There's something melancholy about rooting through a box full of heartfelt scribblings from another time, but it is nevertheless interesting.
For film makers and art projects at least the donated, personalised cards and monochrome photographs would come to a good use.
A Pandora's box of yesterday's treasure that you would willingly open if you're into well preserved, pretty bygones.

Its a small shop, ideal for a browse, especially when you have time to spare.
The stock is sort of overflowing and you can find all sort of trinkets, jewelry,  memorabilia, books.
Downstairs you will find a lot of books, packed everywhere.
It gives you the idea of the place where one mans rubbish is another mans treasure and you can spend an age in here.
Most definitely worth a visit if antiques and rummaging through such stores is your thing.

Great wee shop, the staff are great & very easy to deal with, full of wee treasures & curio's, great range of jewellery & paperweights in particular as well as many odd little pieces that scream "BUY ME!
"...well to me anyway!

Very unique little shop with a very helpful and friendly staff.
There isn't a huge selection because of the size of the store but what stuff they have is great.
I had a very difficult time picking out what to buy because I wanted so many things.
