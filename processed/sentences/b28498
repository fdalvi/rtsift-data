Antiques and Stuff is a smallish outlet packed full of special, unusual furniture pieces from various eras.
If you're looking for a box full of oddities and trinkets, they're not to be found in here.
However, if you are a collector of antiques, special items or are looking to make some money at an auction (the more cynical side) then the furniture in here is very lucrative.
In like new condition and utterly gorgeous, the old dressers and ornate, 1920s cupboards are beguiling as well as being extremely well preserved.
Admittedly I was on the hunt for some wee collectables, so I didn't come out of here with a wardrobe.
I live in Glasgow, so it would've been difficult lugging it back home.
I did however appreciate the courtesy of the shop owner, and the ripest pickings of his antiques.
There were some rare and timeless treasures to be had, so if you're looking to give a classic edge to your home then it's worth coming in for a browse.

Ok, I'm not in anyway way a collecter or expert on antique furniture and trinkets - I do however, always like a look around places like Antiques and Stuff just out of general interest and because I'm always hoping that one day I will see that odd looking plate I use in a place like this going for hundereds and thousands of pounds.
Then I would get onto Cash in the Attic.
Anyway, it seems to me that this place specialises in antique furniture motly, and it is certainly antiquey - but in a somewhat stylish and well presented way in the shop.

Antiques and Stuff is one of the many second hand shops in the area, but  nothing really stands out here.
When i went in for a look I couldn't see anything unique or of great value.
More like an upper class charity shop than an Antique shop.
The staff were very nice though and were able to answer my tricky questions about where it was made and who by.
