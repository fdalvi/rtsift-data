DO NOT GET YOUR CAR SERVICED HERE!
I came here for an oil change and tire rotation.
The guy told me my cabin air filter was gone and he would replace it for half the cost.
I ended up paying $100!
I checked the reciept and there were so many extra charges on there it was ridiculous!
I suppose I could of argued but the guys that work there are kind of scary.
I get all my service done at Camelback Toyota and they are always super nice and never try to rip me off even when I try to act dumb on purpose just to see if they will try to rip me off.
I will never come back here!

The Art of Upselling by Jiffy Lube  BUYER BEWARE!
Want to learn the art of up selling.
Come here.
It can never just be a regular oil change.
They do not realize the value of repeat business.
I suppose they want to get all they can on the first sell and don't value loyalty.
They don't realize a loyal customer will go 3-4 times a year.
Oh well.
Buyer Beware.

Fast, friendly service!
I was in and out in 15 minutes.
The people there were super friendly too!
:-)

Great experience!
Not only did I get a oil change, they filled my washer fluid and washed my front window all in about 20 minutes.
The people were very nice.
Will be going back for sure!

I went there looking for a quick oil change,  but what I got was the royal treatment.
They opened all the doors for me.
Let me know the bad and the good on my truck.
Not many places do that anymore.
The were like the other reviews.
Fast, friendly,  and understanding.
Will always go to jiffy lube from now on.
