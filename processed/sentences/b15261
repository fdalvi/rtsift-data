Had to visit the place, not by choice.
lol had a little accident and needed stitches.
Called to verify hours and headed straight there.
Bonnie was very nice and helpful.
Wait was under 10min and $100 co-pay covered everything.
Yelp offer for checking also covered my prescription for pain!
I had a follow up visit 2 days later and same experience, no wait quick and friendly service.

Why do our kids get pink eye on the weekends and fevers after the pediatrician has closed?
It's inevitable, so we run over here to get checked out.
There's never a long wait, they are so friendly, and most of the time they can dispense the meds we need for our minor ailments and infections right there.
No second stop at the pharmacy!
Bonnie at the front desk is a dear, and she called this morning to check on my daughter after we took her in for strep throat.
Nice touch!
Only knocked one star off because we had a PA student do the exam solo, followed by the regular PA--would have preferred a joint visit to save time and having to explain it all twice (three times if you count the nurse).
When you have a sick kid, you just want to get out of there and start the meds!

I've been going to this urgent care for awhile now.
The reason why I didn't give this 1 star is because all of my experiences have been great, except for today.
Worst experience ever.
Waited almost 2 hours for the doctor, who I had never seen before, to be completely rude to me.
She was very condescending and talked down to me.
She also was telling me certain things about my symptoms which were not true at all and I had never said that.
I called her out on it and she just looked down.
My friend warned me about a certain doctor sending her home saying she just had a "cold".
She went to a different doctor and it turns out she had a sinus infection and pink eye.
Never going back again.
