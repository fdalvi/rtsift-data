I have been going in to Tiffany's nail salon for over 16 years!!
They are AMAZING!!
I wouldnt go to any other nail salon!!
The work they do is great!!
Everyone is always friendly and nice!!
Its the best salon anywhere.
I travel around the world and I would never let anyone else touch my nails, but Tiffanys!

I get my brows waxed there.
I used to only get my brows threaded but when I moved to Phoenix, waxing was the only option.
This place is in my neighborhood, and Donna actually does an excellent job!!
I go back every two weeks and I get complimented on my beautiful brows!

I came in for a polish change.
The guy who did it did an amazing job!
Seriously flawless looking.
I was very impressed.

I asked for fill with gel top and the guy starts to do the gel and goes straight to polish.
I say what about the gel he says this is gel.
I said no that's polish you have to do gel.
He does not!!
I go to pay & the charge me for gel!
I tell them that Ryan didn't use the gel just the polish.
They said that is what they do so it's not thick.
Well HELLO THATS NOT GEL.
Don't you think you should have a choice, after all your paying the same for not even getting what you asked for.
After 1.5 hours I get to go back tomorrow what joy!!
Don't get Ryan.
I can't say anything about anyone else until tomorrow.

I have been to this place 3 different times and have not been happy once.
I have had the whole gamut; full set, fill, and a gel manicure.
The biggest issue I have is not the customer service.
Everyone is very pleasant and kind.
However,  all three times I've been, I've ended up simply going back to another nail salon within a matter of days to have my service corrected (gel peeled off, acrylics were sharply square, despite my request for "natural" and "rounded", or- in the case of my new set- the tips jutted up from my nail bed in a very awkward vertical direction).
I'm not sure if maybe it's a matter of seeing the wrong nail techs, but after 3 times, I won't be back.
