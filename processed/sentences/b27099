This place is great for a fast haircut.
Anna is the best and can always fit someone in.

You never know what to expect here.
We've had some good cuts and some bad, but it seems like the good stylists don't stick around very long.
Today was an ok cut, although the back was pretty crooked.
You get what you pay for here and I'd probably give 3 stars if the review were based on price and cut alone, but when they refused to honor a valid coupon for a kids haircut and wouldn't give me a receipt from the register for my cash payment I left feeling I had been cheated.

I have never experienced such poor customer service at a hair salon.
I recently moved to the neighborhood, and although I would NEVER go to Fantatic SAMs for a color or Highlight I assumed that they couldn't mess up a wash and blow dry?!?
Sady, I was mistaken.
I made an appointment with Rachel for a wash and blowout for a wedding that I was attending that afternoon.
I confirmed my appointment twice as I would be flying to Palm Springs right after.
I got to my appointment at 9:00 am.
Upon arrival, I was then informed that Rachel had the day off and my name had been erased from the appointment time!
The person went through the trouble in canceling my hair appointment, but didn't have the professional courtesy to call the client and let me know?!?
No one was available to service me either.
Had I had the heads up I would've been able to book elsewhere.
So upset and disappointed!!
Most unprofessional salon experience ever!
