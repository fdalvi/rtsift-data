When they say FastMed they mean it at this location!
I booked an appt.
online for my son since his PCP couldn't see him today.
When I arrived, we were greeted, seen in triage, visited by the NP and out the door prescription in hand within 20 minutes!
Now you can't beat that with a stick!
A wonderful alternative for those times you can't get squeezed in to your regular physician.
I'm hoping we won't need to be visiting urgent care anytime soon, but if we do, this is where we will go!

Fantastic service!
Every person we encountered was kind and helpful.
I sprained my ankle and chose to get the splint and decided the next day the boot would be a better option.
They saw me right away (even helped with my crying toddler that i had just woke up because I was on crutches).
I checked in online and was in and out in under an hour, including xrays.I will definitely go here again if my family needs urgent care services in the future.

I've been here to this location at least 5 times and it's not exactly "fast med" every time I come to this location it's slow service.
There's no one ever in wAiting room or in patient rooms but there's still a 10-20 minute wAit it's irritating especially when kids or self is sick.
Service could be better.
