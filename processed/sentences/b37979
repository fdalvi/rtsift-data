Today was my first time at this food fair, and boy was I like a kid at a candy store.
Before I left the house, I told my fiance that I will take the $100 bill and spend it however I want there.
He said OK.
I spent $40 and I got to enjoy lunch, and took two bags of food home, in which Earl had for lunch, and still left with food for dinner, and lunch for tomorrow.
Yes, that is a lot of food.
Items ranged from $1 - $6.
Here are a few items that we bought.
I have listed them to give you an idea.
$1: skewers (pork, chicken, etc).
Banana leaf wrapped sticky rice.
Roti with condensed milk (we threw ours away because they were a big clump of icky mush.
If you really like this combo, you should suggest them make it and give it to you right away) $2: thai iced tea (strong and delicious) $3: sticky balls with delicious stuff inside (I am vague cause I don't know what they are called, but they were savory) $5: papaya salad (scale is from 1-10).
Pad thai chicken (very good).
Fish cakes (they are a bit cold, so maybe to go this item and heat it at home).
typically the larger item in a container is about $5.
The volunteers are super friendly there.
Pretty much each table with different food items so you can pick the items you want, and pay the respective volunteer who is manning that table.
I had an awesome time, a happy tummy, and will definitely be back next month.

This was an awesome monthly food fair.
The food is authentic, just like going to a Thai person's home for lunch and the prices are very reasonable.
A lot of the items are ready to take home or eat onsite.
My favorite food item was the vegetarian noodles.
It came with a egg strips, bean sprouts, lemon, and a yummy greyish/beige sauce (I usually don't think grey sauces are good or safe, but it was awesome).
Other standouts were the pork satays, they were very tender and flavorful, and these translucent rice flour balls with savory filling.
I didn't really like the papaya salad because the tomatoes were too soft.
And if you are going to order the condensed milk roti, eat it there.
It's not a take home item.
I know the Monastery has been doing for a while and there are a lot of non-thai people, so I would have preferred some signage in English.
Besides that, I strongly  urge you to support them at their monthly food fairs!

Following in the footsteps of my friends Debbie N., Regina P., and Elizabeth B., I knew I had to come here for my *Sunday brunch* this month!
Thanks to Debra W. for posting the schedule, since I did not see an event for this on yelp, I just went on my own.
Luckily, I ran into Regina P. and Earl while I was there!
I got to the food fair around 9:20 AM, taking the tip to come early.
The fair runs until 12:30 PM (not 2 like some reports) - this may be a recent change.
After greeting the check-in table with Sawadee-Ka, I paid for $15 in tokens initially.
The first booth I saw was for La Phet Toke, Burmese pickled tea leaf salad - I was SO excited!!
Teri C. would understand!
I only had this once in Buffalo, NY last summer when Eric R. found a Burmese restaurant on yelp there.
I actually have been interested in re-creating this at home but one cannot find pickled tea leaves in Vegas.
The lady at this booth said this was her first time selling it at the fair because her friends encouraged her - she pickles her own tea leaves at home and happened to have an abundance at this time.
She was happy to see me so excited and she gave me a generous portion of Thai bird chillies for it - with rice it was $4.
Next, I came across a farmers market table with kaffir lime leaves, kumquats, lemongrass, and Thai eggplants.
A bag of lime leaves is $1!!!!!
I keep them in my freezer and they last forever.
That is a steal!
Then I got fish cake for $3, which came with a dipping sauce (fish, curry paste and long bean made into cakes) - very spicy and delicious.
With my remaining $7, I got Thai iced tea for $2 and chicken pad Thai for $5.
I stopped to eat at a covered table - trying the pad Thai (enough for 3 people I think!
) and devouring the fish cake.
I decided to save the tea leaf salad and remaining pad Thai for later, and went to get $6 more in tokens to buy mango-sticky rice.
In the end, I spent $21 and now have pad Thai for lunch tomorrow, Burmese tea leaf salad and rice for lunch, and mango sticky rice for dessert today and tomorrow?
This is such a great event - it was very windy today but fun to tour around and it was shaded.
It was right next to the monastery which was beautiful - I did see one monk too.
Everything was AROY (delicious in Thai) and I cannot wait for next month, and I will be bringing people with me!
This took me back to my honeymoon in Thailand, my first country in Asia that I visited, and nothing is better than reliving those memories (through food and temples)!!!
Kop Kun Ka!

For $20, I got a large pad thai, 5 BBq pork skewers, three chive dumplings, tea leaf salad, 2 roti with sweet milk and a quart size bag of kumquats.
Well worth the money!
Next one is on June 23rd, it's gonna be hot so I'm gonna try to get there early!
There were a lot of things I didn't get to try ( fish cakes, beef noodle soup, papaya salad etc).
It starts at 9:00 am and ends at 12:30 pm so get there early if you want to get a table to eat at.
I live close by so taking food home was fine.
Overall, people were really nice and I would definitely go back next month!

I am super picky and over analyze all the tastes anytime I eat Asian food.
What I despise more than anything is unauthentic Asian eats.
Americanized Asian food is a no go for me.
It would be like ordering a gyro and instead of using feta cheese, they put American slices on it.
That would be a sin right?
But hands down, this fair is authentic and as good as it gets.
It's Thai and Laos food, the way Thai and Lao people would eat.
Growing up my mom and all her friends, would sit at the table with lots of food, their feet in their chairs, eating all their food with hands and spoons only, talking in their language and I am sure gossiping about all their other friends that were not there.
If this place was not open to the public, I could see it like this.
Just good, honest home cooked food.
The food is more than superb.
It is fresh, appealing, flavorable and  just heavenly.
The portions are more than suffice and definitely worth every penny.
I always have leftovers.
I haven't had everything here because the options are always vast.
There is just no way you could eat everything they have to offer in one visit.
But my friends, you cannot go wrong with choosing from their satay sticks, pad Thai, soup, spinach cakes, dumplings, fish cakes, sweet rotis, fruits, jellies, sum tom, drinks and much more.
My visits to the fair is somewhere in the time range of 10:30 am.
Plenty of food and lots of options.
If you are coming with the family and/or friends, bring money.
Plenty of it.
Trust me on this.
You will see something else you want and wish you had more cash on you.
Items range from $1-$5.
If you want good eats, then this is the place to be.
Your belly will love you for it and so will their Monastery.
It is a win, win situation.
So mark your calendars, you do not want to miss this monthly food fair!

What a way to spend the morning!
Good food, great friends, and full tummies, plus more to take home for later!
I don't know why it took us this long to come out and enjoy this food fair!
When you first arrive, you swap your cash for tokens-I don't get this...supposedly they cannot take money in exchange for the food!?!?
I saw people paying with cash and the vendors said they take cash!?!?
No biggie though, we had both, and we came ready and hungry to feast on Thai/Laotian Specialities.
Food Stations are set up on the left side, and the dining area is on the right.
Proceeds from the monthly food fair go towards expenses in the Monastery so it is a win-win situation.
You have a whole bunch of tasty goodies to choose from:  Satay, Papaya Salad, Pad Thai, Burmese Pickled Tea Leaf Salad, Various Asian herbs, spices, and produce, Fishcakes, and other seafood specialities, assorted sweets and cookies, and a very flavorful noodle soup, and Thai tea, coffee and a colorful coconut drink as well.
We had the noodle soups, some Thai Iced Tea, and Roti with Condensed Milk which I wasn't a big fan of(too doughy, not crispy enough) We also got Some Burmese Pickled Tea Leaf Salad, Pad Thai, and Sweet Sticky Rice with Mango, Coconut Cream, and Toasted Mung Bean for Dinner and dessert....:9  Definitely looking forward to the next Thai food fair.....ALOHA!!!

How did I not know this fair and this place existed?
I live a mile away!!
The food fair was a nice way to spend a Sunday morning.
It was a great excuse to finally meet some great yelpers.
My husband was a little apprehensive at first.
He made a few Hangover II jokes (you know which one) when I told him I wanted to go.
But now, he's all about going next time (July 28th).
I think it's because we overloaded on just a couple of items and since hindsight is 20\20, I think next time we are going to make an effort to try a bunch of little things and take advantage of the variety.
After you trade in cash for tokens, we walked up and down the line to scope out all the food.
It proved a little difficult because not all food stations had signage.
All you have to do is ask.
What made this event for me was how friendly and helpful the ladies of the event were.
They were all sweet and appreciative of everything you buy because it goes to their church.
My husband waited in line for the chicken skewers while I waited for some pad thai.
The pad thai was pretty darn good for being just $5.
The chicken skewers ($10 for a box) were good too but we aren't going to get as much next time.
My husband picked out these little fried cakes with dipping sauce.
He really liked it....until a fellow yelper pointed out it consisted of pureed fish (he doesn't eat fish).
I would pay money to see his reaction again.
From start to finish, this was a great experience.
I definitely want to go back not just to support the monastery, but to try more stuff: the thai teas, the spices, spinach cakes, the soup, the tea leaf salad, and the sausage.
If you enjoy great thai food, put this little monthly food fair on your to-do list!

I heard about this place last year from one of the Thai restaurants that I tried.
But never gave this food fair a try until now.
I must say that I have missed out on some pretty good food until now.
We got there about 10:15am and there were already lots of people sitting at the tables eating already.
We first tried their soup noodle bowls and it was definitely worth the $5 price.
They do not skimp on the meat or the noodles.
You got a very decent size bowl with a broth that was quite tasty.
Next it was on to the Thai iced coffee and iced tea with some pork skewers.
The skewers were only a buck.
It was too bad the only meat they were serving was pork.
Then it was on to try their Pad Thai noodles.
This dish was definitely worth it.
You got a big portion of Pad Thai and it was delicious.
We will have to come again next month just for this one.
We ended our food fair with a sampling of the various desserts that were being made fresh in front of us.These $2 items were also worth it, but I prefer the salty dishes instead of the sweet delights.
All in all, we had a very good time sampling all the various foods.
The only little negative thing about this food fair, is the fact that the tables and chairs that were set up were not very clean.

We returned yet again for some onolicious Thai food, and this time we arrived at the start (9am) which is, in my opinion the only time to come if you want to have the best picks of all of their selection.
Changing our money into tokens, the lady points to these pastries in a bag that look like Empanadas and says " You want to get a bag of these?, they sell out quickly" "What's inside?
" I asked...."Curry Chicken pastries" she says...A man is also unloading more bags on to her table with a huge grin.
Hmmm?
are we being suckered into buying a bag?
(7 pieces, $5) The lady then sets two bags aside for herself, and going with my instincts, I get a bag.
I love chicken curry, but what it is, is a curry spiced pumpkin and chicken Thai style empanada, and these are GOOD!
half an hour later, like she said, they were all gone.
Also not there was the Sticky Rice and Mango, and Burmese Pickled Tea Leaf Salad, but we got to try the Chicken and Rice with Ginger Infused Jasmine Rice and the lady serving that told us "You'll be back" and you know what?
We got another one to enjoy for dinner.
(along with some bomb Pad Thai) Its THAT good!
The Noodle soup(skinny noodles) was even more flavorful this time too.
About 8 of these vendors made the trek all the way from LA on their own dime, so thanks to them, we have the luxury of enjoying all of their food on a monthly basis.
Beats going to the more well known spots in town IMHO.
You won't want to miss out on the next one on September 22...See you there!
ALOHA!!

The wife and I just had to make the trek down south to try this out.
We had been to a similar temple food fair in the SFV, so we had high hopes for some authentic, delicious and unpretentious Thai food.
As you first turn onto Virtue Ct, you will briefly pass through a small residential area before arriving at the Monastery.
You will see fair goers parking by the side of the road, but no need.
The Monastery has a very large parking lot.
There is a covered outdoor area where the vendors are located, and just a few feet away there is  covered seating where one can sit down and eat.
Half the fun is chatting with others at the communal tables.
We met many people there for the first time, people that had been there a couple of times before such as ourselves, as well as parishioners from Thailand, Burma as well as from Tibet.
The food is absolutely delicious.
It is all good, much of it great.
Pad Thai, skewered meats, fish cakes, noodled soups, dessert rotis as well as dessert dumplings.
So many things to try.
You know you're a foodie when your table is covered in empty plates.
It happens at restaurants, and it happened here as well.
If you are new to Thai food, or new to street food, and have a sense of adventure to try new things, go ahead and stop by.
The people are all very warm and inviting, and the cuisine is all very accessible.
If you enjoy Thai food this event is a must.
You wont be disappointed.

Talk about a great deal that goes towards an even better cause.
The monthly fundraiser for the monks promises excellent eats for nothing.
A group of us got together for Nelson's UYE and filled our bellies and had some to take home with us.
Mike, Anthony, and I ended up going the family style route.
We just need better communication skills.
We ended up buying many of the same dishes.
It goes towards a good cause and it is cheap, so no one loses.
The chicken on rice is such a simple dish, but it is amazing.
The ginger sauce makes it.
The skewers are moist and tender.
The papaya salad carries some kick if you ask for it.
The pad thai comes in a generous portion and taste better than most of the restaurants in Vegas.
Finish off with the steamed sticky rice with taro will do since they will not be doing mango sticky rice until next mango season.
The weather this past month was perfect.
I expect the next one will be comfortable as well.
Come out and be ready to dine until you explode.

If you like Thai and Cambodian food, and don't mind eating it for "breakfast" (9 am-noon), make sure to hit the Chaiya Buddhist Monastery's food fair on the 3rd Sunday of every month.
We moved to Las Vegas at the beginning of this year, and this has already become a tradition of ours.
Very friendly people, very reasonable prices for good food.
So far we've had the meatball & noodle soup, the Thai sausages, the banana leaf-and-sticky rice "tamales" (forgot what they are called in Thai!
), squash filled with coconut custard, sweet roti bread, iced coffee, Pad Thai, green papaya salad, spicy fish cakes, and pork satay.
And we always buy some of the unusual sweets to take home.
Well...we keep coming back, so that tells you we are really enjoying the food!
And I truly love that I can buy kaffir lime leaves there--very hard to find in grocery stores (even Asian ones!
)--they are the "essence" of Thai food to me, the way they perfume the air when you are cooking.
The food fair hasn't (yet) had Tom Kha soup, but I take kaffir lime leaves and lemon grass stalks home from this food fair to make my own (both freeze well).
A nice open-air eating event...don't miss it if you are a foodie!

Why did we discover this so late?!
Well, technically, my friend and I wanted to come last month but something came up and ruined our schedule so we finally got to try it this month!
I must say, I likey lots!
First and foremost, this food fair isn't fancy so don't come here expecting a ton of things.
They also don't have a huge variety of foods for you to choose from.
It's a smaller function run by volunteers.
Kind of reminds me of something like a family gathering.
Come early!
My friend and I arrived at around 9:30 am and all the tables were already taken.
Not to mention, there were already a lot of people there so we parked pretty far from the entrance since the parking lot was full.
There are several ways to go about beginning your trip.
You can exchange your cash for tokens -- any amount.
Don't worry.
If you don't use up your tokens then you can exchange it back for cash.
If you don't want to, I think that's fine as well because I noticed that a lot of them take cash regardless.
Though the token idea makes it easier than getting cash out and stuff.
My friend and I shared most of the dishes so we got to try a majority of them on our first visit.
Stew pork noodles.
$5 ...You got to choose either the rice vermicelli noodles or the flat wide rice noodles.
We went with the vermicelli and we liked it.
Granted, we didn't know exactly what kind of meat it came with.
We figured out that the meatballs were pork balls but as for the rest of the meat, I thought it had chicken too.
BUTTTT it's pork.
We had fun guessing though.
Chicken and rice.
$5...
Awesome dish.
I really really enjoyed this and even bought a 2nd serving to eat as lunch for the next day.
It reminded me of Hainan Chicken ... best part?
You got to choose your meat.
You get the option of white, dark, or a combo of both.
The rice was lightly flavored with chicken broth and eating the chicken and rice together was great.
There was also a ginger sauce you could use but tbh, I don't even need it :)  BBQ Pork & Chicken Satay.
$1 per skewer.
The wait for this is amazingly long so when you get here early, be sure to put in your order ASAP.
People order 20-30 at a time to take home.
My friend and I waited half an hour for our order.
They even had 3 grills going but were still backed up!!
This also took me by surprise because when I think Satay, I think savory...when I took a bite of one of my skewers, it was SWEET.
It was SUGARY SWEET.
Holy moly  ...
I'm not sure how I felt about it.
I liked it but I kinda wanna just wipe the sugar off of it.
Sweet roti.
$1 ...
This was really yummy.
They give it to you right when it's hot.
It was buttery sweet goodness.
I really liked it and I'm glad I had this in the morning.
My body will have time to take care of all that butter!
Definitely try this.
Steamed Tapioca Dumpling.
$2 ..
Interesting.
It was a sweet and savory type of snack in the form of balls with pork filling.
They give you lettuce, cilantro, and pepper with it.
I'm not too much of a fan.
I guess I don't particularly do well with a sweet/savory mix.
I get confused.
Sweet sticky rice with taro.
$1 each.
This was yummy.
They also had a banana version but I didn't get one .. so maybe next time.
Really enjoyed it though :D I had saved this for later so by the time I ate it, it was cold :( ..
I think it'd be better when it was warm.
We also tried one of their coconut jelly dessert things and their thai tea.
Both were good.
But everything was just really sweet to me so bring lots of water with you haha!
My friend and I will DEFINITELY be back and we're going to try to bring other friends to try this as well!
We had lots of fun here :)

I've just eaten most of the food that I bought at this month's food fair as I write this review.
Once a month, the Chaiya Meditation Monastery hosts the fair and I finally got a chance to go with some other Yeeps.
A non-profit event, the proceeds of this event go towards paying the mortgage on the monastery, so you can eat and do good simultaneously.
Per instructions of seasoned Chaiya food fair customers, Nelson Q. and Debra W., I arrived at 9:00am.
The smell of barbeque could be detected as I drove into the parking lot.
I thought I was early, but there were already customers leaving with their plastic bags of food.
There were the food vendors on one side of the parking lot lined up and facing them were tables and chairs for the customers.
I found the papaya salad lady first, placed my order, found the Pad Thai lady, placed an order with her, and then got some pork satay sticks.
Walking along the row, I checked out the dessert lady and picked out a custard flan w/ sticky rice dessert.
WHAT I BOUGHT: Chicken Pad Thai ($5):  you should find this lady first and place your order.
She'll give you your number and then yell it out when your order is ready.
There is only chicken pad thai available, not beef, shrimp, or pork.
The orders stack up quickly, so if you are taking your order to go, you should get your name in ASAP.
Pork Satay sticks: ($1 each):  Very tasty and there are lots of sticks being barbequed on the grills.
You can also get sticky rice to go with the satay, $1 per bag.
Papaya Salad ($5):  This will be made according to your preferred spice level.
I went with zero since I don't like spicy food.
This was my least favorite of what I ordered; it had a very fishy aftertaste.
But, I'm allergic to fish, so maybe it was fish sauce?
Nevertheless, just not my fave.
Curry Puff pastries ($5 per bag):  Probably the best thing at the food fair and the hardest to get because customers must order a month in advance.
Thanks to Michael K. and Nelson Q., I got two pastries from them; the puffs are delicious, made of curried chicken and pumpkin inside of a flaky crust!
Custard over sticky rice dessert ($2):  I basically inhaled this--so good!!!
The next food fair is December 22nd.
There was a steady stream of customers, so I must have been the last to know about this gem of an event.
It was great to meet some Yelpers in person, including Nik O., who shared her desserts, and socialize more with others (Nelson, Sylvia, Anthony, Debbie, Debra, Stephanie, Michael).
And, if you go in December, dress warmly; we were out there freezing just a tad with temps in the 40s; get the soup to keep you toasty!

I had the day to do what I wanted and this was a place I had to see.
I've been missing it each month so today was the day!
Parking was easy in their lot.
I first took some photos of the monastery and grounds.
It's an interesting place.
Then it was on to the food.
Everything is written in the Thai language so you need to ask what things are.
First things first--when you arrive at the food area, there's a very pleasant woman who takes your regular currency and gives you Thai coins.
I gave her $10 and she gave me a 5 Thai coin, 3 ones, and a 2 coin.
I had the five left over so I'm halfway to paying for my order for next month of the curry pumpkin pastries.
I walked down the line looking at all the wonderful foods for sale.
I was looking more for something light that would be a breakfast replacement, in a manner, and I found it where they were making roti--a type of crèpe found in many cultures.
They were not making them from scratch--rather the roti were removed from a bag and placed on the griddle to brown.
After browning, they spread some sweetened condensed milk on the roti and then some confectioners' sugar.
A wholesome breakfast if I ever heard of one.
I also bought a container of sesame balls filled with taro for dessert tonight.
I also got a container of purple rice that comes with a side of coconut milk.
This is a sweet too!
You see why I was here, don't you.
As I was looking for a place to sit, I heard my name and saw Anthony M motioning me to come join their area.
There were a couple of Yelp people there and it was nice to sit in the winter sun and enjoy my roti.
Anthony explained about ordering pad Thai quickly when you arrive because there's a wait list for getting the dish it's so popular.
Another time.
Anthony also let me try one of the coveted curry pumpkin pastries.
It was excellent!
You have to order them a month in advance!
I ordered two bags as I was leaving and I'll forgo bike riding that Sunday so I can come here at 9 AM when they open and claim my goodies.
This is a great place to go.
It's held once a month.

Dirt.

BADASS MONASTERY!!!
Southwest Vegas is painfully notorious for being home to just about nothing, except - SURPRISE!
We have a monastery in the middle of a residential neighborhood.
And one Sunday every month, it becomes home to a mini street fair maxed out with Southeast Asian delights.
You pay up front with cash to an adorable little lady for fair currency, which you can exchange back into dollars if you have any leftover coins.
This is also the same lady who is the gatekeeper to the famed curry puffs - a sweetened curry paste enveloped in a flaky crust - that must be ordered one fair's time in advance, $5 for 7 puffs.
Here you can trade in your usual brunch staples of waffles and eggs Benedict for a piping hot bowl of stew pork noodle or made to order pad thai.
There isn't too much bilingual signage beyond the entrance, especially for the food, but all of the items are homemade and all of the vendors are very proud of their work, so they're more than willing to explain all of the ingredients to those of you who show up as clueless as I did.

Culture at its best!!
We arrived at about 9am and were amazed by the beautiful temple and then it hits us.
The food aromas of Thai specialties that these dedicated ladies and gentlemen are preparing.
You can change your money for tokens and then you are ready to travel table to table to find some of the most unique Thai eats.
I would suggest starting at the Pad Thai stand first as they seem to have the longest wait.
It's not only the best Pad Thai I've tasted but at $5 its a steal.
There are also noodle soups and other enticing choices.
Glad I am adventurous because there are some very interesting items here and have no idea what some of them are, but I am never disappointed and have my favorites which I look forward to month after month.
However, it does change up from time to time as there are regular and new vendors.
I would say the only drawback is that they only set up shop once a month but it is something we look forward to and plan for.
Seating is a little limited so get there early.
Parking is normally not a problem also.
After you grub a little and have your to-go bags ready you can take a walk around their beautiful temple.

Football season is over so I'm back as a monthly regular at the Chaiya Monastery Food Fair!
They are open from 9am to 1pm but do yourself a favor and get their SUPER early or if you will miss out.
This isn't filipino or any other asian time.
I see people showing up 15-20 minutes early.
I've recently learned about the SCP - secret curry puff.
Thanks to 1st Team All Yelp Nelson, I was able to try one of these bad boys and you can be in the know because all you need to do is place an order with the ladies who exchange your cash for Chaiya currency chips.
My favorites are the chicken and rice, mango and sticky rice, and the noodle soup.
They also have made to order pad thai (get there before 10-10:30) if you want to ensure you get an order.
Check it out - see ya'll at Chaiya next month!

Nothing is more authentic than this!!!!!
Thai food being prepared right in front of you by the people who know it best!
Plus all proceeds go to helping the monastery.
It's a win for everyone!
You have to get the Pad Thai!
It's only $5 for this huge serving that could probably serve 2-3 people.
Remember to come early though because wait times can be loooong.
There are other delicious things to choose from like BBQ peak skewers ($1 each), beef and fish ball noodle soup ($5), papaya salad ($5) and dessert roti ($1).
Depending on your appetite, you can have a whole day's worth of food for $15.
The infamous curry puffs are $5 for about 7 pieces, which you have to reserve a month before.
They also sell vegetables for those people who like to cook!
I haven't tried everything yet, but I always look forward to this every month.
It's always great to be outside enjoying the weather with friends and eating fresh home cooked Thai food.

I keep seeing this on yelp and finally got a chance to go!
I am glad I did.
I suggest going early morning because when we went around 11:00 a.m. the sticky rice and mango and pad thai were sold out.
Don't even bother going after 12:00 p.m. because the only thing left were premade desserts and other premade items.
I tried a noodle soup with fish balls I think, which was okay.
I prefer the tom yum type sour soups.
I really liked the pork BBQ sticks a lot!
The rice came in a ziploc bag which was really so Asian, I loved it.
I also tried a rice cake which resembled Filipino puto with different colors and it was okay, pretty spongy not dense like puto.
I liked the ball of not sure what it was actually but it was covered in shredded coconut.
That had a subtle sweetness.
I saw roti and I normally love roti, but I wasn't sure if it came with a curry or not.
Next time I will ask but it appeared to be a dessert roti possibly?
I saw larb was available but I wish there was more hot food to try.
Thanks to Teri C. for letting me try the secret curry puff!
It tasted sort of pumpkin like and not really curry like I was expecting.
It was very tasty.
I think this is a cool place to get some Thai food made by real Thai people.
The people that worked here were very friendly and welcoming to us.

How in the world did it take me so long to try this place.
Every month I have the best intention, but once the time rolls around the idea of waking up early on a Sunday for Thai food loses out to my laziness.
This month, I finally made it, and it was pure awesomeness.
We arrived just before 9 and they were all set up and people were already there waiting.
It's important to arrive early if you want to get your name on the list for pad thai or papaya salad, both made to order.
I got my name on the list and then we perused the other foods while we waited.
Everything is so cheap and tastes amazing.
We ended up with so many delicious items to take home with us.
It was all amazingly delicious.
It took about an hour and we were on our way.
For about $40 we had enough food for our family for a few days worth of meals and lots of variety.
My name is on the list for curry puffs for next month, so see you all there next time and hopefully I get my hands on some of that great-looking mango sticky rice.

Since my friend and I discovered this in October, we've been monthly regulars to this fair.
Be forewarned, this is no huge festival or fair.
Its a charity for the Chaiya Meditation Monastery, where this is hosted at.
All run by volunteers from vegas as well as ones that come up monthly on a day trip, from california.
If you were to describe this fair, id say it be a home cooked style.
First time around, we had arrived at 9:30, weather was still quite warm, but it was packed.
We had to park around the corner, on the street.
All the tables were full, so we had to sit on the side, where a short wall is built with bricks for landscape.
Granted, the amount of people went down, as months passed, and weather got colder, but this time (january), the amount of people has increased again.
I would suggest arriving at 9am if you would like to have a shot at all the available foods before they get sold out.
To start off, they recommend you to exchange your cash for tokens.
Easier for them to be paid, and easier for you to pay them.
Any amount can be exchanged, and you'll receive coins in $1, $2, and $5 increments.
If you have anything left over, you are able to exchange it back for cash, or keep until next time !
Chicken Curry Puff Pastry - This is ONLY sold by pre-order.
Didn't know first month, waited till 2nd month.
Was told prior to 2nd visit pre-order required.
Didnt get it till 3rd visit.
So pre-ordering, you'll receive the product next time, and pay then as well.
Each "bag" is $5 and you get about 8 pieces?
give or take.
They are made off-site so when you pick up your order, it will be cold.
To be honest, eating them there, as is, was not too impressing.
But if you take them home, re-heat them with a mini oven, they are pretty delicious.
You'll make the pasty nice and crispy again, filling of the chicken, curry, and pumpkin nice and warm/hot.
It's actually pretty good then.
They last a while too, if you keep them sealed, so they dont dry out.
BBQ Pork & Chicken Satay.
$1/skewer.
The first time, the wait was really long.
But as months passed, they have been getting smarter, pre-cooking a batch for the early people, so they wont get backed up too badly.
The meat was cooked pretty well but seasoning, all i can say, is SWEET.
Im pretty sure they marinated it at least a day or two, as well as during the grilling process, they probably coat it with honey.
Also have noticed, i think these are made by Archies (the thai restaurant, have seen people with the logo on their shirt around that station).
Chicken & Rice: $5/order.
Also known as Hai-nan Chicken Rice, or at least VERY similar.
Your choice of either white meat or dark meat or both.
Bone-less.
With a side of rice that is cooked with chicken stock, and a cup of sauce made with ginger for dipping.
Probably one of the lighter items they have at this fair, and not sweet as well.
Saves pretty well too.
Can be reheated in microwave without a problem.
Pad Thai: $5/order.
COME EARLY AND ORDER.
Each order, is cooked individually, so it takes some time to get through.
And a lot of people order more than 1.
When freshly made and eaten.
Delicious !
Though the quality control on it kind of varies.
The past few times, its been cooked by 1 person.
A male chef.
This time (january), it was cooked by two people.
Though orders may be fulfilled by the same chef, but both my friend and I think, ours were fulfilled by the female chef this time.
Little sour, not enough ketchup?
flavor.
Seem to be a little lacking on the "wok hei" or flavor from the wok =P Still pretty good nonetheless.
DO TAKE NOTE, if you are buying extra orders to be eaten later in the week, when you reheat in the microwave, put it on a plate, and spread the noodles.
Makes heating up much easier and faster, and it wont harden the noodles.
Pork Noodle Soup: $5/bowl.
Choice of vermicelli or wide noodles.
It was an interesting experience with my friend and i trying to figure out what the meat was.
But, its pork.
Overall, not bad.
Pork meat and meatballs noodle soup.
Simple as that.
Last month (December), when the cali volunteers weren't here, they had a different soup.
It was slightly spicy.
It was delicious !
Was excellent with the weather !
But it seemed like it was a one time thing *sad face*   Sweet Roti: $1/ea.
Roti with pan seared with a clump of butter and topped with sugar, and rolled up.
Its so good but oh so bad.
GET IT!
Great little fair.
Great food, different from the normal in-restaurant style.
A bit early for us night owls, but worth it.
Fairly cheap for most things.
Most are delicious.
Will continue to come to this fair to support the monastery, and fill our stomachs !

Thanks Debra for inviting me!
Yay!
So I arrived super early, which is rare, and there were already people ordering their Pad Thai!
I met a few other Yelpers and we chatted then went into checking out the food.
I got some pork satay, chicken pad thai (over an hr wait when I ordered at 9am, worth it!
), roti, these coconut milk things, some rice pudding dessert, a piece of cake that had coconut in it, and some donut type dessert.
All of the food I had was totally amazing!
I'm usually not one to try new things, Ive turned a new leaf and am going to try many things!
Everything was delicious and cooked perfect.
The pad thai was yummy, one of my orders had all the seasoning and the other didnt, so I added salt and it tasted great!
Now this is the first time I had pad thai, so I dont really have anything to compare it to haha.
The roti was yummy and reminded me of tortillas and butter, and the deserts were also light and delicious.
My son was in love with the satay!
The customer service from the different ladies is all pretty good, obviously the language barrier is there but not a huge problem.
All the ladies were very nice and helpful!
I would advise if you go get there early then check out the meditation garden!
Yay!

Anyone down for eating good food, on the cheap, for a great cause?..
4 Stars for the Food...5 Stars for the prices...Bonus stars for the cause!
Chaiya Meditation Monastery Monthly Food Fair really is just like a scaled-down Thai food festival that you might attend in a larger city.
There are a bunch of homemade items, all at incredible prices.
It seems that most months several of the items are the same, but each month a few items here or there are added or otherwise missing--providing for a little bit of variety.
The food is bona fide Thai food made by supporters of the monastery.
There are several good reviews that describe many of the regular food options...check out what they have to say about the mango sticky rice, BBQ Satay Skewers, Pad Thai, Noodle Soup, Chicken & Rice, Roti, order-ahead Curry Puffs, and desserts we can't name in any language...and the best part is that almost everything is under $5!!
!...and the still-even-better-best-part is that the proceeds go to help the monastery.
Usually held on the last Sunday of the month--so make a point to make it out one month soon.

Shaka Meter:  \uuu/   \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  5  YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(42/365) " Food For A Great Cause"

First let me tell you about the purpose of this fair.
It's done every month to pay for the mortgage of the monastery.
I was told that monastery's mortgage is between 1-2 million dollars (I am estimating it).
So, they have to raise a big figure  to pay the mortgage, which can't only be done on donations.
The main point is that the money that is spent at the fair goes towards a good cause or at least I hope.
Food fair has the most delicious Thai food ever.
The flavors in each food items range from sweet, tangy to spicy.
Some of the cooks are official restaurant owners who are dedicating their time to collect the money for the previously mentioned finances.
But lets go back the topic of food.
Each items can run from $1-5, and you can get it packaged to take home.
My favorites are as follows;  Pad Thai - Spicy-tangy noodles $5 Beef Satay - BBQ meat on a stick $1/stick Spicy fish ball soup - most flavorful soup you'll ever have $5 Curry Puffs - You have to place you order a month in advance due to popularity $5/bag  Chicken-Rice - Simple yet very flavorful.
$5 Sweet Roti - Not sure if that's what its called but its rolled with sweet filling $1/roti  I bought $50 worth of food and it lasted me for  4-5 days.
If you are like me and if you are open to experience other culture.
You can go inside and pray/meditate any time.
The keeper of the monastery Sam is very friendly.
You can also sit and chat with the monk, or just meditate in front of Budha statue.
Only negative side of things is that some of the food will take really long time to get ready since there are limited numbers of cooks and many customers.
Pad Thai takes about 60-90 minutes to get ready, so place the as soon as you walk in.
Overall, I think this was the best time I had a cultural food fair.
I highly recommened to to check this out.

Awesome.
Just awesome.
I wish we had more of this type of food fair here in Vegas and I wish Chaiya was closer to me but, hey, I can wish for a lot of things and I'm not sure if it's going to change a thing.
But, what I do know is that I'll most likely be making an appearance every month to get down on some awesome fresh grub that Chaiya brings to the west side.
I got to try some of the desserts and even took some home to enjoy later at my convenience.
You have to pardon this review a little bit because I sampled some items but don't know what the names are.
However, I bet if I was to see it sitting on the table, I would definitely know what's up.
The only thing that I did try that I can remember the name of is the curry puff.
CURRY PUFF FTW.
I was tipped off by a buddy of mine to get my name on the list so I can pick up a bag the next time I come through as they only take pre-orders a month in advance.
David V. was kind enough to let me snack on one from his batch and I was sold immediately after the first bite.
Mind you, I was sick that weekend and the nasal congestion got in the way of the full force of flavor but if I was able to taste it through that, it has to be damn good!
The wife picked up a few things as well and took a bunch of stuff to go in order to tide us over to next month.
Left spending about $20 and went home happy.
The Chaiya food fair is a good time.
Aside from the awesome amount of delectable treats and dishes, I got to see a few friends of mine (and elites nonetheless) and had a blast sitting in on conversations with other people passing through to see what the food fair was all about.
Plus, the elites made it much easier to navigate to where all the good stuff was!!
Like I said earlier, this will probably be a monthly occurrence for the K. family so if you are every in the area and looking for some fresh Thai food, I'll be there ready to share my experiences and get down on some grubs with you (especially those CURRY PUFFS.. well, don't expect me to share too much.. but I will if you ask nicely).
Nice job Chaiya!

Why in the world would I want to drive 18 miles ever so early on a Sunday morning?
Bullocks!
I keep hearing about the curry puffs.
What's the big deal?
A friend was kind enough to place an order of curry puffs for me last month.
Of course, I had to go.
I got to the monastery real early so I can grab my curry puffs then head to the gym.
I was one of the very few that was there.
The older ladies were still setting up so I was walking around.
The monastery is so beautiful.
It feels like a different world.
Intricate gold roof designs, foo dogs by the entrance, a big gold structure in the middle...just gorgeous.
Some of the food was ready so I bought some of my Thai favorites: satay, nam prik, sticky rice with mango, fish cakes, pad Thai and spicy pork similar to chicharron.
There was this lady who was giving me a whole schpill that went on and on.
I had no clue what she was telling me - I don't talk Thai.
I didn't want to be rude and interrupt her because she seemed like she was talking the business.
A few minutes later, I politely smiled and asked her where to get my curry puffs.
The older ladies running the show were so sweet and hilarious.
"Oh, pretty girl", "hey sexy, try this", "honey, come here".
But nobody seemed to know where my curry puffs were.
The food was cheap.
A whole box of satay for $10.
Sticky rice with mango for $6.
Most stuff like crackers, cookies and rice cakes for $3/pack.
Curry puffs for $5.
And they're delicious!
I only had a few minutes before I had to leave.
I was told I needed to find a lady with tokens to get my curry puffs.
It's like a mission on "Amazing Race"!
So, I asked every older lady holding old cookie tins (that's where they keep money and tokens) about my curry puffs.
Finally, some lady told me "curry puff lady don't come about 9:30-10.
" What?
I can't stay that "late".
So, I left.
Curry puffs, you and I aren't meant to be...

Actually, it seems to be on the last Sunday of every month now--you'll need to check their website for dates: http://www.chaiyacmm.org/ It's well worth it to find this event!
Every time we go, there are a few different things.

This event is a must!!
The food is authentic and you can watch the preparation of most of the items.
Not only is the food phenomenal, but the prices are extremely affordable.
There is plenty of seating outside and it is a great opportunity to interact and socialize with fellow yelpers.
I recommend that you arrive early to this event to prevent long wait times.

Inexpensive?
This is more like half of a $ on the Yelp scale!
And there's so much great food!
As I'm a first-timer, I have to give a huge shout-out to Anthony M. for announcing his two unclaimed curry puff bags on Yelp.
I was super grateful because they must be reserved one fair in advance, which translates to one whole month.
They're a treat with curry sweet potato baked in a puff pastry, and they're even better when you take them home and pop them in the oven (advice from Andrew C., I believe).
It's just $5 a bag for seven pieces, which is a great deal.
I also really enjoyed the BBQ pork satay skewers.
Not only are they a steal at $1, but they're very balanced in terms of sweetness and spice.
Well worth the 20+ minute wait at peak times for a batch of however many you feel like ordering.
The roti are another $1 treat, and they're sweet, not savory.
You'll see them preparing roti in hot oil at the table, but they actually wrap them in foil and fill up a box, meaning that there's practically no wait time.
Eat them while they're hot because they won't be nearly as soft if you take them home or something.
There's also some kind of noodle soup that I can't really put a name to, but it has pork and a reasonably hot stock.
It was the first taste that I had and it was a welcome treat on a very windy morning.
I wouldn't call this one a deal at all, but it's worth a try.
The chicken pad thai is a pretty generous portion as well for $5, and it comes with plenty of bean sprouts and scallions.
It's less greasy than any restaurant pad thai I've had, and it's still pretty tasty although it may have lacked a bit in fish sauce and sweetness.
It's another really popular item with a wait, and we were lucky that we arrived before 9am or else it would've been a huge chore wading through the list.
I also got to try some items from friends.
The egg rolls are definitely hot and crunchy, although they're the predominantly veggie variety, not something with pork and crab as I would have just loved.
I also had a bit of mango sticky rice, which was fresh, sweet, and texturally blessed with that crunchy topping.
The som tum (green papaya salad) wasn't anything to write home about.
I like the tomatoes, but the flavors are too muted overall, even without adding the fresh cabbage.
It needs to be supplemented, and that's what I did with the crunchy dried shrimp and fish mix that's a worthy sweet, salty, and spicy snack on its own.
The spicy number of 3 was definitely on the higher end of 3's as far as I'm concerned.
Some of the other items worth trying: the fish cakes, the fermented lemongrass pork sausage, and the fish with red curry paste and collard greens.
I also enjoyed these flat, sweet dessert items with corn embedded.
There's blue (taro) and green (umm, something?
) varieties, and they're both sweet and reasonably chewy.
The food fair at Chaiya is a monthly must if you have any appreciation of good food whatsoever.
I will definitely return when I can.

Another beautiful yet windy Sunday morning.
I arrived at 11am, immediately placed my order for the pork skewers and sticky rice $1 each, wait time 30 minutes, then wandered over for a bowl of pork soup $5 and a Thai Ice tea $2.
Delicious.
It's getting pretty crowded since my first time here over 2 years ago.
I sat on the landscape bricks in the sun as all the tables were taken.
I didn't see the Yelp group, so either I'm blind or no one was there.
A nice tour through the back garden/reflection area, 40 minute meditation inside the temple....and then it was time to head home for some March Madness games.
Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys authentic Thai/Laotian food, and a much better deal than a restaurant.

CHA, CHA, CHA, CHA CHAIYA!
After seeing EVERYBODY check in here every last Sunday of the month, I finally got the chance to join them this last one on 3/30/14.
Better late than never I guess.
As I show up with my wifey, I just happen to bump into Andrew C who was nice enough to give me some pointers.
He kind of ended up being my Chaiya guide along with tips by other Yelpers.
First thing you notice about this place is that its right in the middle of a neighborhood community.
First stop was to put my name down on the clipboard for an order of Pad Thai ($5).
Wifey got 10 Pork Satay Skewers ($1 each).
Then on down to the Sticky Mango Rice table ($5).
After that the Thai Soup table ($5).
Next is Papaya Salad ($4).
Since just about everything was made fresh, you had to do a bit of waiting for certain things.
Like the Pad Thai.
They cook it from scratch with two big woks so two orders can be cooked at a time.
Same goes for the Papaya Salad.
The guy is literally peeling the skin off the fruit and finely slicing it for the salad mix.
As for the Sticky Mango, they can only peel and cut the fruit so fast so the wait for that is based on how many mangos they can carve.
Once they run out of that and sticky rice, you are out of luck.
The Pork Satay Skewers are all ready to go and cooks pretty quick on the grill.
The Thai Soup table has all the ingredients ready to go as well.
You just need to select thick or thin noodles, then they throw it in a medium sized styrofoam bowl  along with broth, meat, and pork balls.
Shout outs go out to Nik O, Debra W, Terri R, and Chris V for helping me out also.
Nik gave me her extra Eggroll to try out.
Debra told me what there was to drink.
Terri told me about the vegetables available for purchase.
Lastly, Chris told me about the Curry Puffs that you have to order a month in advance.
He even gave me one from his stash to try.
Thanks a lot guys!
Some random info: Cash only!
Preferrably small bills.
Sometimes they give you coins that are worth 2 dollars that is valid for their items only.
Come early!
Show up just right before 9 am for great parking, better selection, and getting your Pad Thai quicker by being one of the first to sign up.
Phone reception is low so it might take you a while to check in and upload pics sometimes.
Lastly, this is an outdoor event so always be prepared for what the season may bring.
If you follow what I just pointed out from beginning to end, you will fare much better than most peeps that show up later on.
Overall, I am kicking myself for not coming here sooner.
Next time I am bringing back up.
Usually on Saturdays and Sundays, I tend to sleep in but in cases like access to delicious cheap food and good company, I don't mind sacrificing a little bit of sleep.
Hay, maybe I can nap........errr I mean meditate for a bit inside the monastery.
Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #92

How have I not written a review for this yet?!
This monthly food and fundraising event has been a nice treat in the Southwest area of town.
In the past couple of years, it has really gotten busy though!
Once a month, usually the last Saturday, Chaiya Mediation Monastery holds this food gathering where you can grab homemade treats for $5 or less.
It starts around 9 am and lasts until 12 pm or so.
But these days, they run out of the popular food items way before noon.
So come early if you want your pick!
You can trade your cash for tokens but it's really unnecessary now since all the vendors take cash directly.
Among my absolute favorites are:  * Burmese Tea Salad - I love Burmese Tea Salad and I have not found one restaurant in Las Vegas that makes it.
(If you know otherwise, please let me know!
) The only thing is that it's not a regular item there.
It's only been available a few times unfortunately.
(Which makes me want it even more!
)  * Mango Sticky Rice - Okay, who doesn't love this Thai dessert?
Sweet rice with ripe mangoes, what's not to love?
However, it's a seasonal thing and they run out fast!
You need to be there early to score an order.
* Pad Thai - Made to order and a bargain for the amount you get!
* Pork Satay - Made to order and $1/stick.
Put your order in and come back to get it later on.
Some months it's super tender, other months it's only okay.
Other food items found:  * Hainanese Chicken and Rice * Papaya Salad (spicy!
) * Curry Puffs (You need to order these a month in advance!
) * Soups * Chive Pancakes * Sweet Roti Pancakes * Desserts  I was spoiled in the beginning because the Husband would head out and pick up the food while I slept in.
It was a nice treat finding all these goodies waiting for me in the kitchen.
But now it's a much longer wait to get your food because it's so crowded.
Nonetheless, I'm glad the monastery is getting so much business and visitors.
They could probably extend the amount of food vendors each month to accommodate the demand.
Side note: Cash only.
There are tables and chairs in a shaded area, but it's hard to get a spot these days.

Chaiya's Thai food is legitimately home-cooked food.
The volunteers for the monastery frankly work their butts off to make this one of the most welcoming and affordable food events every month.
Cheap prices and delicious authentic food will keep me looking forward to this event on a regular basis.
I honestly have dreams about the skewers and how tasty they are.
A little sweet and a little salty, they're a steal at a dollar a piece compared to any sort of restaurant.
Other favorites of mine include the mango rice (though there's too much for me to finish) and the sweet soft Roti.
I didn't enjoy the egg rolls or the noodle soup as much as I would have liked, but they were still pretty good.
The wait for Pad Thai is a little crazy, but it did have some very clean and distinct flavors.
Still, I look forward to the next one constantly...

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place!
The food is good and they sell sour, spicy sausage that I order at Lotus of Siam.
I was stupid and only ordered one order or 3 sausages,  next time I'll make sure to order at least 5 more orders!
I can eat them all day!
My daughter loved the bbq skewers,  if I was smart I should've ordered the box of 10 but it was my first time there and such a rookie.
The pad thai was good but the papaya salad was delicious!
I tried the Lous style and was not disappointed!
I will definitely make sure I stop by every month to support the monastery with their mortgage!

Food was delicious and super cheap.
I loved the Pad Thai and the pork skewers were so good I actually ate pork, which I never do.
People are friendly and there are a lot of other yelpers there.

This is so very random.
There you are, driving into a neighborhood when BAM there's what appears to be a couple of massive homes converted into monasteries.
Such an unusual sight, but cool!
First of all, get here early to get the food you want.
Once they sell out, they sell out.
Especially the pad thai - it gets its own waiting list.
On that note, there is plenty of food!
I'll list what I've had.
And it's worth noting that everything is relatively cheap!
Plus, you're supporting your local Thai community.
- Pad Thai.
So, I like this but it isn't my favorite.
I don't even know how to describe it.
It's... good.
But here's a weird observation: it does not preserve and reheat well if you stick it in the fridge and microwave it later.
I've never had this happen with noodles.
This one is special, clearly.
- Skewers.
A dollar.
It could not be cheaper.
They're light on glaze, chunks of fat here and there, but totally worth it.
- Noodle soup.
This is a bit underwhelming.
Some light broth containing a few mediocre meatballs and thin noodles.
Pass.
- Mango and sticky rice.
If they have good mangoes, they'll have this available.
If you're a mango lover, and a Thai food lover, I probably don't need to tell you twice.
Get it.
- Sweet coconut milk and rice balls.
Clearly, I don't really know what this is called but I like it!
It's coconut milk, sweetened, with goodies floating around in it.
- Thai tea.
It's your average Thai tea.
- Roti.
I'm not sure why but they cover every single one in butter and condensed milk.
Seriously, why?!
You can ask for them not to, but otherwise, it's getting slathered.
- Egg rolls.
Cheap and delicious!
Easy decision.
Definitely worth going to at least once.
The food may not be the best Thai food ever, but it's an event.
The people are ridiculously nice and you support a small community in Vegas working hard to feed you while fundraising.

I've been reading reviews of this food fair for months now...every time I read one I think, "How cool.
I should go one of these days.
"  Well, I finally had a weekend where my fella and I had absolutely nothing planned for Saturday night and Sunday, so we decided to go.
We pulled up at 8:45, and I was stunned with how beautiful the monastary is!
Right off of Rainbow, in this little residential area is a beautiful Buddhist temple.
It was not super busy, so we made our way over and put our name down for Pad Thai, and browsed around a bit.
This Fair is incredible...where else can you get such tasty food for such cheap prices?
And the money goes to support the Monastary, which is really cool.
Some of the items that we sampled were:  Pad Thai:  $5 for  huge portion that was enough to share, and very tasty.
Curry Mushrooms: $5.
This we took home.
Three kinds of mushrooms and curry...HOLY SPICY BATMAN!
So delicious!
It was wrapped in a banana leaf to steam when it was heated up.
BBQ Pork Skewers:  $1 each.
Yum.
And I don't like pork.
But YUM.
Thai Tea and Coffee: $2 each.
Perfection!
Egg Rolls:  $2 for 4.
These were good...almost as good as my favorite Thai restaurant, which isn't too shabby, considering they were made in a parking lot.
There were many other stations selling other foods, plants...even hats!
I can't wait for next month to try the Mango sticky rice, roti, and the curry puffs that I ordered!!

This is as good as it gets!
The food is authentic and dirt-cheap.
As soon as my wife and I left the parking lot, we were talking about how much we looked forward to coming back next month.
For $29 here's what we got: delicious pad thai, 8 bbq skewers, spicy papaya salad (you can get this thai style or laos style, FYI), 2 roti, 1 order of dumplings (comes w/ 6 pieces), 3 egg rolls, and a refreshing Thai tea.
We brought home the left overs and enjoyed them for dinner.
With summer just around the corner, you're going to want to come early in the morning to beat the heat!

This is a fun event.
The food is good and cheap.
I load up for a few days when I go here.
Pad thai is $5 (get it), skewers are $1 (get it), mango sticky rice is $6 (up to you), drinks are $2 (up to you), and little squares of dessert are $2 (get it).
The people are nice and helpful.
Park somewhere and check it out.

I've been trying to come here for months, but something always seems to pop up at the last minute.
Finally made it in this morning and saw some friendly Yelpers as I browsed.
Almost everything was being made fresh and sold at bargain prices by friendly faces.
Spent just under $25 and got enough food to last the day: waited for a plate of chicken pad thai ($5) that was huge enough to share, $5 for 5 bbq pork sticks (fresh and hot off the grill!
), $3 for some small and spicy fishcakes, giant plate of mango sticky rice for the BF ($6), and even snagged some special-order-only curry puffs under Lisa H's name ($5)- unlike anything I've had before!
Everyone working was super nice, just wish there were a bit more signage to clearly see what was being sold and where.
Parking was easy to find up the street, and the monastery itself is gorgeous.
Never would have expected to find such a structure in the middle of a nice residential area behind  a strip mall.
I'll have to go back another month for papaya salad and soup- took everything to go this time and soup didn't seem to be packed to travel.
Next time I'll stick around.
