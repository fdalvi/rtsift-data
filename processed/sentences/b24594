I compared the prices of multiple mobile grooming services in Vegas.
Cloud 9 had the best prices and no extra "trip charges" or "de-matting fees.
"  They even include toothbrushing with the price.
Their prices were actually equivalent to what I would pay at a traditional grooming shop.
They groomed my small dog and afterwards she looked great!
I will continue to use this service for regular grooming of my dog.

Im sure its a great service.
However, the website claims appointments usually within the week.
I called, they said 5 weeks out, so good luck with that!!
Its summer now, my cat needs to be sheared before she melts, not by sometime in August!

Don't bother making an appt with this company, they don't keep them & the owner will argue with you when you try to get to the bottom of  why the appointment you made 12 weeks in advance is being changed to a different time.
