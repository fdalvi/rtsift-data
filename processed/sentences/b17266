You know it's family run when you hear the staff arguing with each other behind the counter while little old dad is slowly wiping each table, grinning happily at you as you sink your teeth into one of their bagels.
Can't help but grin back, gloppy cream cheese on the mouth or not.
Empire is a humble little place offering fresh bagles and cream cheeses.
Does it compare to Einstein Bros?
I do love Einstein's, and they do have more to choose from, but since there isn't any by me, Empire Bagels is the next best thing.
Bagels are that perfect combo of crisp and chewy goodness and deli meats are cut on request.
Cream cheese helping is extremely generous.
The chicken salad is not too mayonnaisey, with big chunks of white meat.
You actually taste the chicken, not the celery.
One chicken salad bagel will run you $5.75 including a little pasta or potato salad.
The most expensive bagel will run you about $7 and has the works.
Great fresh bagel place for the west valley with an irresistably cute New York flair.

Erm, this place is closed or out of business?
I went there yesterday about midday.
All I saw inside was a painter's bucket and a couple of office desks.
Their website says they're "Now Open!
" but unless they've moved (there was no sign indicating this) the place doesn't exist.

out of business.
this was a great place to get food...
