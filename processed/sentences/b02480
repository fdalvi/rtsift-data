I've never eaten anything but ice cream at Dairy Queen, but recently I was encouraged by a coworker to give it a try.
This Dairy Queen gets pretty busy, but I was served within five minutes.
The shrimp is actually really good; not too fried-tasting.
The fries are as good as any competitor's, and the sauces here are not bad!
However, what really blew me away was the blizzard.
Mm!
How can you go wrong with an Oreo Blizzard from Dairy Queen?
I got the biggest one, and it was definitely too much for me to finish.
Service here was courteous though not exactly friendly.
Their selection of ice cream cakes was ample and tasty looking!

Always been good!
Had a choc ice cream double dipped in cherry!

The chocolate covered strawberry bowl was very good.
However when you ask what is in the different blizzards, no one seems to know and they have to go get a list.
They did find out for me however and were pleasant about it.
Always very good, prices similar to other places.

friendly and fast!
but they are in need of a remodel.

Just got out of the drive thru at Dairy Queen.
Sat down to eat a burger and a corn dog.
The food was deliciously hot and fresh.
Customer service was great.
Would recommend any day.
