I'm surprised there aren't any other reviews on this little gem because I know it's been around for at least a year.
We stopped in with some friends for dinner tonight.
They have a full bar, but I had a glass of chardonnay rather than my perfect rob roy.
The chardonnay was a flavorful pour at a really good price.
Our waitress and her helpers were very attentive (with the exception of water not being delivered as soon as requested).
I ordered the tilapia and it was some of the best tilapia I've eaten.
Pan fried so it was just a little crispy around the edges and with wonderful flavor.
I also had a baked potato which was very good.
There are good baked potatoes and then 'meh' baked potatoes and this one was good.
It came with pats of real butter and a generous portion of sour cream.
The vegetable of the day was a sauteed squash which was flavorful and just the right degree of firmness.
Tonight I chose the soup of the day - Italian Wedding - rather than my usual salad.
It too was very tasty!
The lights were a little bright to my liking but that's just me.
They have what looks to be a little one person band on Saturday nights - may have to try that at some point.
Even though my wonderful companion is not keen on dancing - unless an elevator dance at a wedding - it's fun watching the couples here in Sun City show off their dancin moves.
We will definitely go back and although I may be tempted to try something new on the menu I think I'll have to go with the tilapia, but next time - make mine a perfect rob roy, perfectly please...

Well the service was good but I just didn't care for the food.
I found the food to be bland and just not very flavorful.
I have definitely had better and I have definitely has worse.
Your call.

Food was good.
Service was a little slow.
Only the owner and one wait person waiting and serving tables.
