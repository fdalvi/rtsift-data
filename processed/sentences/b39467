I went to Allan a couple years ago after purchasing a groupon for a mani/pedi for Futzpah.
He used to be located inside Summerlin Medical Plaza and was apart of a podiatric office.
I still to this day remember what a fabulous job he did on my hands and feet.
Only problem for me, it was so far away from my house, I knew I'd probably never return.
Well, he has since moved into Sola Salon across from Boca Park, and has a place he calls his own now.
Just like the last time, he did a great job on my nails.
The place was clean, he used a brand new tool on my nails (sterile processed) and also uses he very own exfoliant that he makes with only 3 ingredients.
3 chairs available, so make sure to call and make an appt prior to coming.
He does charge more than I'm used to for a pedi ($45) but I feel you get what you pay for.
He has good, professional nail polish, nothing old or cracked or acetone added to thin it out.
Totally recommend this place.

The cleanest salon you'll find!!
Allen and Phyllis are the best!
Very thorough pedicures that are used with the best products.
Both of them are excellent people and I enjoy having conversations with them during my pedicure.
They will definitely keep you entertained while giving you the finest pedicure!

I have a fear of being a Anjelah Johnson poster child when it comes to mani/pedi.
Absolutely not so in this case.
Clean and comfortable environment, sterilized, sanitized and nice pretty pinkies at the finish line.
