Well, it's kind of far from where I live (West Valley), so that sucks, but for what I went to the Motopark for, it was just the right setting!
I was in the Survivor Mud Run 2013, which was intense and a lot of fun.
The park was easy to find, had enough space for the spectators and runners, and offered coffee and hot cocoa on a really cold day for $1-- that can't be beat!
I would have to come back to watch one of the races with motorcycles, etc to review the park for that kind of stuff, but all in all the park is pretty cool, parking is in the mud and there's not a ton of it so get there early for whatever you're going for.
Also, exiting the parking lot is rough (only one way in and one way out... and it's pretty much a single lane) because if people are scared of making left turns to cross a highway because there's a car a mile away in both directions, you're gonna have a bad time.

What a great place to enjoy the MUD BOG or Sand Drags or stock cars....just sooo farrrr from North Phoenix.
