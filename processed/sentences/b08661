How many people can seriously say they love going to their dentist?
I CAN!!!
Dr. Brittain and his amazing staff are tops!
They are friendly, very well organized (great follow-up and reminder calls!
), tell you everything that they are doing, recommend, and don't recommend.
For example, when I asked about whitening my teeth for my wedding, they didn't sell me something way over my budget, the recommended something that worked for me.
AND they sent me a Thank You card for sending a referral to their practice.
Not just a form letter or something, a hand written, thoughtful note!
Old school and awesome!

I wish I could give 0 stars.
I had a HORRIBLE experience.
I found this location due to a Groupon purchase which was for a Cleaning, X-Rays and an inspection.
All they did were the X-Rays and the inspection and it was suddenly, "we refuse to do the cleaning until you pay $400 to have 2 more deep cleanings done.
"  They also found some fillings which they also said they refuse to fix until I have paid the $400 upfront fee for the 2 deep cleanings.
If you look up bait and switch in the dictionary, you will see this business in the description.
They will upsell you and that is all that they care about doing.
If you have deep pockets and don't care how much you pay for oral care, by all means, but if you are a family on a budget, I would stay FAR away from this office and this doctor.

From the moment I walked into the lobby the staff displayed a level of professionalism that you don't get to see everyday.
Each staff member that I came into contact with gave me a handshake and said, "Welcome to our business".
I don't normally enjoy going to the dentist, but this has been the complete opposite.
They made me feel very comfortable and confident that I was going to be happy with my experience, and I was!
So I set up an appointment for my 9 year old son on the way out.
Since then we have both been in to have work done.
My son need one filling and he took it very well, then trotted off to school like nothing ever happened.
I started with a deep cleaning from Bobbie Lynn Tucker , RDH.
She was very nice and personable, did a wonderful job cleaning my teeth, not to mention gentle.
I was never in any pain either during or after the procedure.
My following visit was with Dr. Brittian, DDS.
I needed a few fillings and I am very pleased with his work.
Again gentle and quick.
My teeth look beautiful and feel wonderful.
They were great with explaining all the costs and have cool perks like a Rewards Program.
I also liked the glass back wall that gives the patient a private calm view of the outdoors.
The flat screens are cool too, but my only complaint is that when I asked quite seriously if they could change the channel, ( I dislike sport shows a lot) they were not going to budge.
That might be something they want to work out.
Other than that I really would recommend  them to everyone.

After having not so pleasant experience with another dental office that has multiple locations, I was not looking forward to finding a new dentist.
HOWEVER, my first impression was a good one, the receptionist was very friendly and I was seen not long after I arrived.
I was greeted by everyone who came in contact with me, in a friendly manner.
Dr. Brittian was very thorough and I even found out that I didn't need all the expensive dental work the "other dentist" told me I needed!!
I will definitely recommend him.

I highly recommend Dentistry of Old Town Scottsdale!
had a very unpleasant experience with another dentist in the valley and I needed a second opinion.
My friend recommended Dr.Brittain.
This was the best dental experience I have ever had.
Everyone was friendly, professional, and I all of my questions were answered with no pressure to receive or purchase extra services (which happened at a different dentist in the valley).
I appreciated that they accepted Aetna vital savings as well.
I never have to wait for appointments they are ready for me right on time which is rare at most doctor or dentist appointments.
I am so happy with Dr.Brittain and his staff - what a wonderful experience!!
I highly recommend them!

The staff at Dentistry of Old Town Scottsdale are incredibly friendly and extremely helpful.
I have never felt as welcome in any business establishment as I do in Dr. Brittain's office.
Dr. Brittain not only does excellent dental work but he is fast and thorough.
He explains everything beforehand so there are no surprises.
I have been a customer for 1.5 yrs and I have never waited more than a couple minutes to be seen (even when I'm early).
I have struggled with teeth sensitivity all my life.
Previous dentists have promised results and their promises were always met with failure.
While I'm not out of the woods yet, for the first time ever, I was able to handle the air in my mouth!
I have been able to drink my first bottle of cold water and even eat food straight out of the frig!
Dr. Brittain and his staff have been extremely patient and have gone above and beyond what any other dentist has tried.
They did not give up on me!
In addition, their billing has been wonderful.
With other dentists, I would go through the coverage process, only to be met with a bill that I didn't expect after the work was completed.
This is not the case with Dr. Brittain's office.
They explain the costs up front and the only surprises I have received are credits when the insurance covered work that I anticipated paying for.
Excellent service, excellent staff, excellent experiences.
Dentistry of Old Town Scottsdale has my vote!

My family has been going to Dr. Brittan for 10 years.
He is an excellent dentist and can handle any situation you can throw at him.

Thank you Groupon for leading me to Dr. Brittain and his friendly, helpful staff.
They take the time to explain procedures and really make you feel welcomed.
No complaints from me.
Make an appointment today!

I am the kind of person who likes to find a business and stay loyal, if they earn your trust and respect.
The relationship with your doctor or dentist is best when it's long-term and you feel comfortable.
I was fortunate enough to find Dentistry of Old Town Scottsdale when I first moved in Arizona in 2008 and I have been going there ever since.
I've changed eye doctors, primary care physicians, and hair stylists over and over, but even when I've moved farther away, I have continued to go back to see Dr. Brittain and his staff.
They are warm, friendly, welcoming, and caring.
My semi-annual check-up is like a visit to see the family.
The experience is pleasant, you never real rushed, they go above and beyond so that you understand costs and steps in whatever procedure they're doing, and always make you feel like you are their favorite client.
I would recommend them to anyone without hesitation.

My crown came off on NY'sEve - called my regular dentist in CO, & he recommended getting a repair kit to fix it till I could schedule an apt with a dentist.
Hadn't been to a dentist in AZ, so started calling from the phone book on Fri.  No Luck, till I called Dentistry of Old Town Scottsdale.
They could get me in that Mon, but thought I'd better google them first just to see other's reviews.
Excellent reviews, & it was just a recementing of my crown, so off I went.
Very nice staff, Dr. Brittan was prompt, friendly, and very professional.
Now I have a dentist in AZ that I will definitely return to, & have already recommended him to several of our "snowbird" friends!
Wonderful way to start the New Year!

My kid's visit was overcharged.
They have charged two "items" that weren't performed.
2 of the 4 sealants came off in 3 months, so I have visited another dentist to redo the procedure on my kid.
I used this office because of all the positive ratings on Yelp but our experience was nothing like it.

I love this place!
Doc and his staff are so helpful and friendly!
I've been going here for a little over 2 years now and have never had a problem.
I recommend dentistry of old town Scottsdale to anyone needing to see a dentist!
They are great and really know what they are doing.

Really nice people.
I initially went because I had a coupon for a cheap cleaning.
I don't have dental insurance so I am always looking for a deal!
Service was top notch!
Last week, I had a tooth break on me (a baby tooth, my perm tooth never came in).
They extracted the tooth for me.
The staff made sure I was comfortable and i felt zero pain.
They called to check up on me the next day as well.
I was even able to use the yelp deal to bring the cost down.
Super nice people!
Great service!
