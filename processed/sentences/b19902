It's always hard to tell if I like a place because I've got a comfy seat and they're playing the music I like, or if the place is genuinely good!
A Room In The Town, however, had good service when I was in - despite the fact that I was the only person in at that time of morning.
I'd ducked in for a coffee between business meetings in the city and needed to update a report.
Sunshine streamed in through the window, the cold was a memory...it was like sitting my own loungeroom, except someone very nicely brought be a damn fine latte.
Having only gone into A Room In The Town because the service at the Standard, which used to be my regular, was so apallingly awful, it was a pleasant find.
The smells wafting out of the kitchen, the good range of menu, and the good service will make sure I head back.
That and the fact that the music playing was by an artist I love but music I had not heard before - which means I have some investigative purchasing to do!

I'm a big fan of their sister places, but had never visited A Room in the Town, previously.
It was a touch underwhelming.
Overall, we said: "A Room in the Town is a smart place, with good, attentive service, but the quality of their dishes doesn't match this.
Take the pointless croutons out of the soup, and the glob of vinegar off the egg, and you probably had two good but unremarkable dishes.
I've always enjoyed my trips to their William Street place, but can't say the Dundas Street branch made such a positive impression.
Maybe I'll pop by to try their dinner menu, at some point, as I like the set-up and suspect the kitchen is capable of producing better dishes than I was served, today.

Absolutely wonderful place to dine!
We loved it, it was one of the most memorable parts of our trip!
