This for the store on 155 West Combs Rd.
San Tan Valley , AZ this location is newer and the layout is pretty nice  There's something for everyone at Fry's food store, which means I can get all of my shopping done in one stop as opposed to shopping at smaller store where I only get a few select items.
For lunch items I am a fan of the deli counter, but just to warn you be prepared to wait, sort of slow.
it's relatively clean and organized space, and tons of parking and a UPS store next to it, where you can drop off your mail.
Believe me it is far better than the US Post Office in Queen Creek that is another review.
Where this store could be better at customer service:  The store workers need to get the  shopping carts out of parking out, due to their lazy customers just don't put them away--Not the store fault.
The meat department could be more customer service, it like pulling teeth's to get a special order....... respond it not corporate policy to do that.....That okay I'll buy my meats from the local butcher which will gladly cut to order anything I want.
Overall this store is not bad.

I've always had pretty good service here and I've always been happy with the salmon and steaks we pick up!
Always good prices and great deals on the regular!

This Fry's is great.
Super-friendly staff, and everything is easy to find!
