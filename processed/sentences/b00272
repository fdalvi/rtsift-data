I love this place, have been going to "Poppas" for years, started back when they were on the corner of Milwaukee and Stoughton.
Best place to get Dogs and Gyros.
The building may be run down, the booths maybe hard plastic, but the Gyros and Chicago dogs are worth the trip for a great lunch!

This place is now closed and the equipment is up for auction.
No idea why.
*** Nice staff, funky Chicago stuff on the walls (sleeve from a Chicago album on the wall, Wrigley stuff, the usual and the unusual-Jayne Byrne, anyone?).
Dogs are tasty and come with skinny fries that are easy to pop into your mouth.
I took a chance on a hamburger and found it pretty good--I'd have it again except I feel like I should get a dog when I go there.
Just off the Capital City Bike Trail, in case you need an excuse for why you are wolfing down dogs, cola, and fries.

I grew up on this food.
I even worked here at one point in time.
This place is amazing.
Eat here or else...
