Recently went in to buy some suits for all the guys in the family for a special occasion.
Seemed like a no-brainer with all the help they offer there.
Men's Wearhouse is a one-stop shop.
Find the suit.
Easy.
All price ranges.
They help you accessorize.
Everyone looks like a million bucks.
Sales are good too.
They also offer dressy casual clothes.
Great jeans and fun button-down shirts.

Good location, just north of the quarter.
Adam, the assistant manager, was very friendly and very helpful.
He made some really good suggestions, the tailor was professional and quick.
I will definitely be back.

just like the men's wearhouse i visited in San Fran, only better...
I needed to get a few suits for my new job.
the staff at this particular men's wearhouse was the most friendly and knowledgable staff I've ever had to deal with.
They were absolutely great and that store has now become my exclusive outfitter of clothes for all occasions.
I am not an easy size to find i am 6'7 320 pounds and the fact that they were able to take care of me in every way possible was amazing.
I also bought some stuff at one price and then got an email for a sale that made the things i bought even cheaper, they exchanged my stuff no questions asked so I ended up paying the cheaper price.
they tailored all my clothes and a few things didnt fit just right so they took care of it a second time for free.
I just cannot say enough about how amazing this store was and how amazing the staff was as long as I live in the phoenix area I hope to have a long standing relationship with this store...

There's a reason this place is featured as the best place to rent a tuxedo for a wedding!
More to come later as the process continues but all I can say is that the Men's Wearhouse knows what they are doing!

It was our Son's Junior Prom this year and he wanted to rent a tux.
I remember my first tux rental many moons ago....and how awkward that experience was.
Well, that wasn't the case here.
The girl who helped us was only a couple of years older than him and knew a few people that attended his high school....so he immediately felt comfortable talking to her and listening to her advice on what to pick.
She asked him questions about color, style, etc.....he looked at her like a deer in the headlights....it was hilarious.
Of course he didn't want to go with my selections because I'm the old guy who's choice of style is "outdated"....what?!
Whatever, I don't understand the kids nowadays and their sense of style...so I was happy to have the young girl employee assist us.
I stepped back and let them do their thing.
She showed him the options and helped him pick it....my role was to pay the bill.
After it was all said and done, the total damage was $181, which included the tuxedo, shirt, vest, tie, cufflinks, and shoes.
It's too bad Kiddo is not the same size as me, otherwise I would've bought a tuxedo instead of paying that much to rent one....and he'll probably outgrow it for his Senior Prom, so I paid the rental price instead.
The day we went to the store, there were at least a dozen other kids waiting in line behind us to get fitted for tuxedo rentals...we picked the wrong time to go but lucked out and came just after they opened, so we beat the rush by a few minutes.
They didn't rush us though and thanks to the great service of that girl, he was happy and had a good time at his first prom....memories that will last forever.

The girl there was very nice but shady.
There was a buy one get one free deal going on.
As she started handing me pants, I tried them on.
One was a hundred dollars and the other was a $170 .
The $170 pant superseded the $100 pant and I felt a bit rushed .
Then the foreign tailor came out to size me.
He said, " you need lines ironed.
"  I said, "ok" little did I know that each crease ironed cost $20.
Very bad customer service.
Bought two shirts, one black and one white.
They didn't have my white shirt in stock.
She said she would have it there in four business days.
I went back six days later and asked if she had it and the stunned look on her face made it obvious that she had forgotten.
She assured me that she would have it there on Wednesday.
There is no rush on this shirt , so I thought I would wait to see how long it would take for them to get back to me.
I will repost if and when they contact me.
It is obvious to me that once salesmen get their commission the customer is an afterthought.

A previous store messed up entering the date of the event and they rushed to the rescue.
Quality service and patient staff.
Even helped my friend get his pants updated when it was found too small right before the wedding.
Great job, guys!
You not only reversed a bad situation, but doubled down on the quality and service of the Men's Warehouse chain.

Horrible experience for my daughter's wedding.
Most of the tuxes fit horribly after they were supposedly altered.
My husband's sleeves were way too short and the female clerk was very rude.
What's the problem she asked?
My sons had to take their tuxes back twice also.
They had to run down and pick them up the day of the wedding.
My husband's STILL did not fit and 2 people could have fit in his shirt.
He ended up having to wear his own shirt and jacket which did not match the rest of the guys.
Very disappointing experience.
