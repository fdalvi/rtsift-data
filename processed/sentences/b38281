Great friendly service.. Family-operated and Filipino;)

It has a friendly atmosphere and affordable.
They have knowledgeable experts.
They would never overcharge for their service, and they also have discounts for students.
You can make an appointment or walk in.
The line gets a little long sometimes, but people don't mind the wait because they are that good.

Very professional people.
Accommodating, just like you are visiting a filipino home.
Everyone's tries to make you feel at home and relax.
Anita is very knowledgeable and easy to work with.
The line gets long so make an appointment.
It will save you time.If you come prepared with your documents it's a breeze.
They have TFC.
The Filipino Channel.

I wish I didn't have to give any stars.
This place is seriously the worst !
They submitted my w-2 all wrong.
I still don't even have my tax refund back.
I've been down here multiple times to fix the problem but they have no clue what they're doing.
It's insane.
Now I have to get copy's of all of my stuff and send it in to the irs myself.
And the manager did nothing for me.
Didn't even talk to me or help.
