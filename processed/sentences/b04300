Whenever I'm in the mood for a little pool and a little hookah, this is where I go...plenty of tables, plenty of hashish flavors(I'm partial to pomegranate, myself), and an internet jukebox(I tend to pick "Master of Puppets" by Metallica, "Don't Stop Believin" by Journey, and we LOVE to torment everyone with the 19-minute long 'Goodbye, Sky Harbor' by Jimmy Eat World, haha!
)...

Total Joke!
A place for kids to smoke!
Even if you just want to play pool, you have to deal with all of the smoke and immature people.
For some reason a few people think hookah is cool, but for each is their own!
This place can really be a great place if it was serious!

The only things I have to say.
Over packed bowls.
Unfriendly people.
Over priced pool  The worst thing of all CAMERA'S IN THE BATHROOM!!!
I get safety reasons and stuff but that's taking it WAY to far.
Disgusting and disturbing...
