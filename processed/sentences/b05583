Should have done this sooner but Just wanted to say that this Dricing school is great.
For my son's 15th birthday I told everyone to get him gift certs to this Driving school....yes they have gift certs!!!
We got enough to get him 6hrs of instruction and the 30 hour Class required by DMV.
I was very impressed by what he learned!
He got 100% on the driving part of his test and the person who gave him his test asked who taught him to drive beacause he did so well.
I would totally recommend this school to anyone who has a teen ready to learn how to drive!!

Loved them!
We hired them for our 16 year old daughter to make sure she was ready for the driving test.
Her instructor Tammy was awesome!
My daughter scored a 100% on her driving test, we couldn't believe it!
We will certainly be using them again for our next daughter in a year.
Highly recommend them!!

We gave our twins Safeway as a birthday gift.
Our instructor was Karen and she was great.
She had both girls driving all over Vegas and Henderson, including the freeways in just a few lessons.
She was always prompt and gave us appropriate feedback after each lesson.
I highly recommend Safeway.

Just an update twins took driving test today and both passed with high scores thanks to Karen and Safeway.

It took me forever to finally decide and take driving lessons.
Sure was worth the wait though!
I had my six hour lesson with Terry and he was the most patient, sweetest and informative instructor!
He made me feel comfortable driving behind the wheel right away and he provides so much confidence in you that a beginning driver like myself makes me feel that I've been doing this for a long time.
He gives you so many pointers and tips that will instill on you every time you're behind the wheel.
I highly recommend Terry if you're looking for a great  and informative instructor to teach your teens or adults that are just beginners with driving.
Very thankful and glad that he was my instructor!

After a long search in town I find it.
