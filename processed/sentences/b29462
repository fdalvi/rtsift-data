Michelle has years of experience and can just walk into your home and help you with any project large or small.
She helped me pick colors to change my entire house from walls to ceilings.
I wanted to keep all my furnishings and she helped with placement and updates to make everything look fresher.
See her new website: www.changesinteriordesign.com !

We took advantage of Michelle's coupon for a 2-hour consultation for $100 to get advice on color selection for the interior of our house.
We wanted something bolder than the various shades of tan we currently had, but I was not at all confident in my ability to select the colors.
Michelle picked out various colors for main walls, accent walls, and niches.
It was a combo of colors I would not have considered and was a bit nervous about it, but we decided to tryst her and WOW!
It looks fantastic!
A friend commented that our house now looks like a model home.
Plus, the painting contractor recommended by Michelle (Paulino) was also excellent.
Lower cost than what we had paid 10 years ago AND he and his team did an excellent job and maintained a very neat workspace.
My husband is VERY nit-picky and even he was impressed.
It's the first time he didn't have a single complaint!
Michelle also advised us on curtains, backsplash, and cabinets and we plan on following up with her about this.
Obviously, we highly recommend Michelle!

My first experience with a designer and although Michelle is a great person, easy to get along with...
I felt I overpaid for what I got.
The expectation was that she would just decorate the first floor of my new home in 2 weeks time...the challenge was accepted yet 6 weeks later, lack of communication and always to have to follow up every few days on progress...
I didn't get done half of what I expected to accomplish.
My first and definitely last time paying for someone to help me decorate.
