Took my car in for an oil change.
With a coupon it wasn't bad and they use valvoline so I was happy.
They said I needed a new air filter seems I always need one everytime I take my car in.
My Dad had just checked it a few weeks ago and said it was fine!
Whatever.
Then they said I had a tail light out.
Yikes!
Well it really wasn't a tail light which I can get a ticket for, but the back light on the window.
Jeez, I think I will go to autozone and repair it myself.
They did quote me with a 45 minute wait and it was right on.
Though, I was sitting in the waiting area and they called me on my cell to tell me it was ready, UH hello McFly!!

I stopped in for an oil change after calling ahead to make sure they weren't too busy.
I was out within 30 minutes, just as promised.
It was a good experience all around -- clean facility, competent service people, very fair price.
The only thing I felt might be missing was a waiting room.
For sure I'd  go back the next time I need service.
