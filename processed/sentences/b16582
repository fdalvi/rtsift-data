Burger was good.
Fries were good.
Soda was good.
FROSTY was AMAZING.
for a cheeseburger combo it is $5.95.
To upgrade to large it's a dollar.
Frosty's are $3 for a small.
They don't charge you extra for BBQ sauce.
This place saved my stomach (strangely enough) I was hungover and the burger and fries literally kept me from dry heaving.
Thank you wendy's.

WOW- the prices almost made me pass out.
I like Wendy's though, and I was hungry, so it had to do.
Enjoyable food, clean food court, but way too expensive to want to come back.

$10.58 for a medium-sized chicken sandwich meal.
Not very good, but one of the few places open at 2am on a Wednesday night :-(

Terrible lol.
Lady that Works in the night shift was terrible, doesn't know how to take orders,, just straight our mean!
Lol
