Went into see Dr. Kiernan for the first time in several years last week.
She has an office located inside the Wal-mart shopping center.
Dr. Kiernan has been my family's vision specialist for almost eight years and has always been fantastic.
One great thing about Dr. Kiernan is her office; it has a separate door on the outside of the Wal-mart vision center.
This is great for those that don't want to deal with the chaos inside Wally world.
Overall, my appointment was splendid and I got my new contact prescription in little time  I will definitely see Dr. Kiernan next year.

Dr. Kiernan is excellent.
She is the best eye doctor ever!!!
Very knowledgeable and extremely helpful.

Dr Kiernan and her staff are phenomenal.
I've been seeing her (no pun intended, of course) for several years now and have had nothing but fantastic experiences.
She is very professional, super nice and very thorough.
Makes going to the eye doctor a very pleasant experience and I appreciate it.

glutton for punishment, i am not.
accurate documentation of prescription- fail.
communication with 1-800-contacts & fill of script- fail.
