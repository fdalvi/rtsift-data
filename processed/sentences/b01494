Don't dog Old Navy.
Despite a sub par and semi-annoying marketing campaign, clothes here are aight with me.
And where else can you get a perfectly good pair of cargos and boardshorts for less than thrity bucks a pop?
I'm no fashion snob, but I like to think I can generally distinguish "awful" from "not awful" in most cases.
For the "not awful" variety, Old Navy is dirt cheap and top notch.

Old Navy has the best sales!
Even when I'm not shopping the sales racks  they have great deals on cute casual clothes.
I think the quality of their clothes is also really great compared to most cheap and cheaply made clothes.
A great place to pick up some summer essentials without breaking the bank!
Why not pick up those flip flops in every color imaginable?

Wow do I hate Old Navy.
The commercials make me want to slit my wrists.
They have the most awful colored clothing ever.
Colors I didnt even know exisited.
And it seems like they only ever have stuff in sizes 12-24.
TWENTY-FOUR??
Holy crap.
They do have extra long wife-beaters so I'll give them that, but again, in some real alien colors.
And the normal colors they are always out of.
The checkout line is run by some dumb ass high school kid who cant figure out the register and the line for returns wraps around the store.
I dont have time for this!!!
ARG.
