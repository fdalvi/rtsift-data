I give this little salon 5 stars because they are able to do exactly what I ask.
That being said,  I get a standard pedicure and standard manicure.
I do not get gels, full sets, or amazing designs, so I am unable to review those services.
This is a family establishment, husband and wife team.
Very friendly and they do quick work.
Getting in is easy if you call the morning of to make your appointment and I am able to get in and out within my hour lunch period.

I've only been here once, it was 20$ for a salon pedicure and they charged an extra 5$ for French tip.
They didnt do a bad job but I probably wouldn't go here again.. U get what you pay for..
