Wonderful selections of yarn.
Very friendly staff and helpful too.
Lots of great classes.

I didn't have a very good experience shopping here.
The store smells pretty bad, which is off-putting, and the first person who waited on me didn't know where stuff in the store was.
I was also pretty irritated that they wouldn't wind the yarn I bought when I've done it myself with no problems.
Telling me to put it over my dining room chair when I've already told you I'm traveling is not helpful.

This is my least favorite yarn shop.
The only reason I ever go is because it is close.
Dragonfly yarn isn't too far away & worth the drive.
Most of the staff is unfriendly with the exception of the British (I think) woman.
She is a major asset to the shop.
Wish she worked at another LYS.
