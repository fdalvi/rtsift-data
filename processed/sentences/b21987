When they closed the stores, including the Biltmore, they  reopened in a new small location at Town and Country, south east corner of 20th St and Camelback, under different owners.
The young man who is running it now couldn't be more pleasant.
He has a great attitude and will help build the business.
I had heard they had reopened but couldn't find them.
When I called information, I was informed the number was disconnected.
We did find them.
I told the young gentleman who about it.
He said the number was working and would inform the owners of the information  issue.
We had chef salads which were presented nicely.
I like it went the food likes like something you'd want to eat.
They also were fresh.
We also had two regular size hot chocolates.
What we had was good but nothing to special.
I personally thought $24 for what we had was to expensive.
I think it is going to make it hard to rebuild their business unless they make things more reasonable.
They are not the big going concern they used to be  While we were there they were out of napkins, a basic that really can't be replaced by pieces of paper towel.
I think this can be one of those nice little places to go for instance after the gym which is nearby.
I would like to see them make a go of it.
I will go back for a coffee and a snack, but for lunch or dinner, there are better places to go to eat for the same expense.
On the other hand, I haven't been to many places where the person behind the counter made me feel more welcomed and appreciated.
That goes a long way toward my going back anyplace.
This guy can makes everything seem better.
I don't have the exact address but it is near the resale shops and Sou R Salad.

My favorite Coffee Plantation, although I miss the one at the Biltmore!!
Coffee is way better than Starbucks!!
For a great local coffee place, come here!
