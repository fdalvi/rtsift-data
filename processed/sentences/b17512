Don't beleive the hype about illegal immigration.
There needs to be a comprehensive solution to the problem.
Most immigrants to the U.S. are hardworking and pay taxes (contrary to popular belief).
The problem with Sherrif Joe is that he and his merry band of thugs are not trained to enforce immigration laws.
Sherif Joe has implemented a policy of racial profiling and calls it immigration enforcement.
It's spin.
He has done more harm to Maricopa county than any other politician and has cost the taxpayers millions of dollors in legal fees and settlements.
It's time for a change.

It's long since been time that we get rid of this sheriff and get one who wants to talk about the specific details of his office's criminal enforcement performance.
The discussion about illegal immigration has gotten old, as has Sheriff Joe's recurring abuse of power and harassment of other local leaders.

God bless MERICA and Sheriff Joe!!!!

Thank you to our law enforcement officers for keeping us safe.
Luckily, I've never had a personal run-in with the MCSO, but I appreciate everything they do.
Enough can't be said for the people who risk their lives every day to keep our families out of harm's way.
Keep up the good work!

Sheriff Joe's the man!
