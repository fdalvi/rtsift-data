THE FOOD  Standard Quiznos fair.
Pretty consistent in quality.
I recommend skipping the fountain drinks if you are sensitive to water taste.
SETTING  Standard sandwich chain shop, clean.
SERVICE  Fast, friendly  and consistent.
Just the way I like it when I am hungry.
SUMMARY  Nothing exceptional but nothing to complain about either.
Good place to grab your sandwich.

I stopped in today because my sister had a BOGO coupon and insisted we go there since it's so close.
Food quality is standard Quiznos, of which I have never been a fan.
Sister appealed to my cheap side and lured me with a coupon.
The BOGO coupon you ask?
Yeah, we couldn't use it.
That was irritating.
The guy gave us some song and dance about how the coupon was fake (despite the fact we had just used coupons from the same book at a McDonald's about 10 mins prior to coming here with no problems).
So I don't know what that was about.
He was perfectly nice about it and gave us a free drink and chips for the trouble.
But still...  Don't get the fountain soda!
I got a diet Pepsi and it tasted so gross and strange I threw it out.
The store front was clean but the bathroom was nasty - poop on the toilet seat and no soap in the dispenser.
EW.
I get very concerned when a food establishment does not have a clean bathroom.
No reason for me to return.

The staff was nice enough, the food was good, but if management is reading this, the restaraunt itself was really dirty.
There was no lunch rush so there is no excuse for dirty floors, tables, chairs, and a full trashcan.



Good food great staff clean restaurant I'm been going there 5 days a week for last 8 months
