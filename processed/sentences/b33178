Big Jim's is a family run business.
They have been around for many, many years but they just moved they're location across the street from where they used to be.
I have been there several times now.
They got me a new catalytic  converter for my Chevy cheaper than anyone else in town could offer.
They even do a bunch of extras for free when I just bring it in for an oil change.
When I asked if I needed a new "this or that",  Jim said it was all fine and I didn't need anything else.
At most places, they lie and tell you you need something even when you don't.
Jim seems to pride himself on being honest and he is!!!!!!!!!!!
They are so easy and pleasant to deal with anytime I need to take my car in for anything.
I highly recommend him to all my friends and family!

We've been going to Big Jim's ever since we moved to Phoenix.
They have great prices on their oil changes and I LOVE that they never try to get you to do "extra" work that really is not necessary.
I really trust Jim and his son-in-law to take care of our cars.
When work is needed, they are really realistic about what must be done and what can wait, as well as making good referrals when they can't do the work (I have a Prius, so this goes for my electric engine system).
Personally, my husband and I have been really impressed at the lengths they go to to make sure problems are fixed and that you are satisfied.

Went here to get a new muffler for my truck.
Ted runs the place and does a great job.
Very helpful and personable.
They did a great job and charged a great price.
Highly recommend for any exhaust needs.

Great work at a fair value.
I have used them for years for everything from simple repairs all the way to custom exhausts.

Great shop.
Owner Ted is straight forward and very good at what he does.
Worth the drive to his shop.
VERY fair pricing.
He can tackle ANY exhaust issue so avoid the insane dealer prices and visit Big Jim's Mufflers.
