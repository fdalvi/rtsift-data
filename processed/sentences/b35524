See Spot Shop is a full-service holistic pet center that provides one-stop shopping for a wide variety of pet products and services, including high-quality pet food, treats and supplements.
The new 1,566-square-foot store offers northwest Valley residents a broad selection of unique merchandise, including collars, beds, clothing, toys and grooming supplies.
This new store also provides grooming services and a series of veterinarian-supervised anesthesia-free teeth cleaning clinics.
The Valley's first See Spot Shop location has been operating at the Summit Shopping Center in northeast Scottsdale since 2005.
Stetson Village, a 144,360-square-foot community shopping center, is anchored by a 57,860-square-foot Safeway Store, and has developed into a vibrant neighborhood shopping center offering an array of national and local retailers to the trade area, and a number of high-quality neighborhood restaurants.

I am so excited that we have a caring pet shop that provides grooming near our home!
We took our pets (2) poodle mixes to be groomed and bathed at See Spot Shop for the first time last month and were very happy with the results.
Our dogs were happy and looked awesome when we picked them up!
Prior to finding See Spot Shop  We had a groomer for many years and she retired so we had to find a new groomer.
We ended up taking our dogs to one of the local pet stores near us.
We used them a few times and each time we picked our pets up (hours later) they were exhausted - they slept once we got them home and didn't have any interest in playing.
So we started to look for a better place to take them.
So glad we found this shop!!!
Our dogs were so cute with their new hair cuts- they were jumping and running around.
They didn't show any exhaustion and played after their visit here.
We made our next appointment with See Spot Shop and we were pleased!

I am very impressed with this store.
It is neat, clean, organized, and has a great variety of high end items for your dog.
The employees I have talked with seem very knowledgeable and are very friendly.
They also have a grooming area and they do a fantastic job.
We have been getting our dog groomed at a different store for years but decided to give See Spot Shop a try.
We were extremely impressed with how our dog looked and plan on using them for all future grooming.

I've been taking my 3 dogs here since they opened the doors, but have failed to be a good Yelper until now.
I have an 7lb schnoodle, a 40lb aussie mix and a 60lb senior chow shepherd, all with a huge variety of different grooming and dietary needs.
My dogs LOVE to come here for grooming.
I am slightly particular about the cuts my dogs get (I'm a hairdresser), especially on my schnoodle, and and they've nailed it every time!
My Chow mix is aloof and nervous by nature, but her tail starts wagging in the car when we pull up, and when she's done she's floofy and beautiful.
My aussie mix is short hair so he just really needs a bath and a few extra belly rubs.
The prices on the grooming are so reasonable compared to what's in my area (Cave Creek) that it's so worth the drive, and the staff and groomers have always been courteous and prompt!
We never have to wait long for our dogs to be done.
Their Scottsdale location is closer to me and I visit regularly to buy food (they don't yet offer grooming there yet).
The staff at both locations are so well educated on the products they carry.
You may feel the food selection is a little pricier, but the quality is so superior it has even helped my senior dog dramatically improved the quality of her life.
I love knowing that I'm supporting a local business when I spend my money here.
Don't hesitate, this place is terrific!

There are pet stores, and then there is "See Spot Shop" on Happy Valley.
This place is AWESOME!
I have one of the pickiest eaters of a puppy, and the amazing staff has always been there with samples of food to see why Ben best responds to.
Along with the time and concern they give Ben, David and Marcus have always gone above and beyond in helping us with tips on raising our new puppy.
Ben is a happy, healthy, well adjusted puppy who loves it every time we go to "See Spot Shop".
THEY ROCK!

We love this place!!
They know exactly how to help our little chug with his picky eating habits.
Fantastic customer service!!

Took my maltipom here to get groomed and I am super happy I did.
After attempting petsmart and not happy with there service or feeling comfortable leaving my dog with them I left.
I called

My dog is picky with her treats and this is the perfect place for her!
They have a great assortment of treats and chew sticks.
We got her a "bully stick" made out of beef tendon from here and the man said it would probably take her a few weeks to chew through.
2 days later we came back to buy her an even longer one because she just demolished the first one.
It is her favorite thing to chew!
The employees are always very friendly and helpful.

This is the cutest shop ever if you have a pet!
My friend lives near there and told me about it.
It was like Disneyland for my two little weenie dogs.
They got some new treats and new collars and I also looked into doing the teeth cleaning clinics.
The people that run the store were very knowledgeable and polite moreover they were really sweet to my fur babies!
I will definitely be back as I love to support local as long as they are kind people offering great services.

I love this pet shop!
The man who runs the store let me in an hour before they opened one time to help me because I had tons if questions in dog food!
I haven't tried the grooming but I love that there's a window so you can see that the facilities are clean and kind for the puppies!
I also LOVE their selection for leashes and collars, they're adorable.
They only sell the best and I love that they know everything about their products!
Great place :)
