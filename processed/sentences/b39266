It's a shame there aren't any reviews on here already for this place.
I lost my eCig last night and needed a replacement.
I had never been an actual smoker but picked up vaping from my coworkers.
The last eCig I had...I had juice which had nicotine in it.
Something I didn't really need.
The lady who helped me was warm and friendly, showed me the EVOD (which is new) and explained all the features about it.
I was sold!
The price was good, too.
She made sure to ask me about my habits and showed me a selection of zero nicotine juice.
She let me smell a few to make my choice.
Overall, I am glad I came in!

I have to say the family that owns this place is awesome.
Exceptional customer service and never once been rude.
I live down the street and been coming here for almost two years.

I needed to go to Game Stop to buy GTA.
Didn't realize from afar that the sign actually says Smoke Shack, instead of Game Stop.
They have the same colors and font as Game Stop!
Lol.
Anyways, I went in to check it out.
I never heard or seen this place before, so why not, right?
The young girls that worked there didn't greet me when I walked in, didn't ask if I had any questions, nothing!
They were snobby and acted like I wasn't there.
It's like..how you gonna treat your customers like that?!
I didn't feel welcomed at all!
I just bought only ONE pack of cigars.
Their prices are expensive that's why.
I went back in my car, smoked a cigar, and guess what...it was all stale!
:( OMG!
I got ripped off!
First the customer service is awful, then the prices are too high, then they're selling expired products??
Big NO NO!
That was my first time here and this is my last time in this place!
Maybe if the 2 girls were helpful and more considerate, I'd give this place 2 stars instead of just 1 star.
:) lol
