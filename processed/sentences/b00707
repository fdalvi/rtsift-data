This is the place I always used to go to after I left the bars when I was younger.
I remember being so absolutely plastered one afternoon that I sat down and to this day am certain I had two big macs there.
(Any doubt why I quite drinking twenty five years ago???

The location is convenient for getting in and out of late at night.
What really makes it interesting is the people from the neighborhood around it.

All I wanted for x mas was a cheeseburger and fries.
Thanks to Jack in The Box for being open.
Dreams do come true...
Thanks to the staff who came to work today to make my cheeseburger.
Jack,you get 4 stars just for being open!

Stopped into this smaller Jack in the Box today for a bite, armed with a coupon for 2 free tacos.
Added in a Chicken Sandwich ($1) & some Frank's Red Hot from the secret menu (free) & it really perked up both the tacos & the sandwich.
I was all set with a fine light lunch for ONE DOLLAR!!
The bathroom, dining room (with BOOTHS!
Yay booths!
) & service were fine too, so they earned 4 Stars!
:-))
