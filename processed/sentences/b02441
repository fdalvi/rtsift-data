Simply judging this book by it's cover, I would want to come back.
The staff was for the most part very unfriendly, both on the phone and in person.
Although a couple of the younger girls in the front were somewhat friendly, the majority of the staff gave me the impression that they didn't want me there and quickly herded me through there as quickly as possible.

If I could give NO stars, I would.
BEWARE.
I got botox injected in my forehead and around my eyes.
The injections in my forehead were too low.
My eyebrows drooped.
The arch disappeared.
Picture having straight lines above your eyes for eyebrows.That's what my eyebrows look like.
Like an angry cartoon.
When your eyebrows droop, your lids droop.
Mine hang down to touch my eyelashes.
When I went back in, they said they were sorry and that in two weeks, hopefully it'd go away.
Its been a month.
I still have no eyelids.
The botox around my eyes was done unevenly.
I have crows feet around one eye and not the other now.
Picture that smile.
When I asked for a refund, they declined and offered to inject the crows feet that hadn't been injected properly in the first place.
Uhhhh... no thanks.
Stay away from this place.
I've shed some tears.
They have a fist full of my money and I have no eyelids and an uneven smile.
But...they're "so sorry".
Ugh.

This place is simply perfect!
The staff are diverse in ages and styles, everyone is professional and warm and REAL!
The decor is inviting and lovely, comfortable and calming.
The estheticians are beautiful inside and out, the doctors professional and knowledgeable, it's obvious they really know their business.
I have had microdermabrasions, laser and lamprobe.
My facials have been expertly fufilled and the products are top of the line.
Jan Marini Bioclear is a miracle cream, Latisse made me grow eyelashes when i was missing big sections.
I've referred friends and family young and old and all of them felt and looked better after visiting the office.
Thank you Image Skin for helping me find a more youthful ME.
