How are you out of chicken when that's all you serve?
Place is horrible they need to be retrained.

KFC has seriously gone down hill .WAYY over priced .will stick with Churchs chicken from now on

I really do try to shy away from giving bad reviews but this place is just horrible!
I've tried this location 3 times in the last year and it was a horrible disappointment each time.
Badly dried out chicken from sitting under the heat lamps way too long, failing to mention that they are out of gravy until you come back to complain that you didn't receive any with your order, and the most annoying drive thru window in the valley!
I hate sounding like a redneck bigot but the young lady taking orders from the drive thru should be required to speak at least a little English!
I have no interest in learning how to speak Spanish just so my order is correct from KFC and I don't have to repeat my order several times before she just resorts to guessing what the hell I want and throwing it in a bag!
