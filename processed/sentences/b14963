nice selection of fixtures, but once they have your money don't expect to get any service.
they didn't  return several phone call or emails.
When you do finally get them on the phone after placing several calls they promise to get back to you but they don't.

I was looking for the perfect sink and the guy on the phone (forgot his name) was really patient w/ me.
I was on their website and was asking measurements on at least 20 vessel sinks.
I finally found the one that was a perfect fit for my custom vanity I was building.
Thanks!

Great customer service and product availability.
I needed three specific sinks and had difficulty finding them.
Ferguson had my sinks at a fair price.
I ordered them on the phone and Ferguson delivered them to me the next morning.
No shipping charge.
This kept my project on schedule!
