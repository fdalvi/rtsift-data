A sleeper of a golf course!
You will love it!
It is a bit of a drive, east on Dynamite almost until the road ends, but worth the drive.
The course is great, from layout to course condition, you can't beat it.
Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.

Great course!
Unbelievable views.
With no houses built on the course yet, the pictures from the tee boxes are sure to owe your out of town friends.
It's unfortunate that so many people have already found this gem, it's hard to get a good tee time!
One of my favorite tracks!

Very nice course, which still requires some finishing touches.
It's a bit narrow in spots so bring your A game.
Think links course in the desert.
Nice views and scenery.
We played after a rain storm a few days prior and the course was cart path only.
Not recommended for cart path only.
A couple of things need attention.
First, the staff wasn't all that friendly.
They packed the course and due to cart path only limitation it took us 5.5 hours to play.
No food yet, and drinks and snacks are only available from the cart, which we saw twice in 5.5 hours.
They could use better signage out on the course too.
Still, it's a nice course.
