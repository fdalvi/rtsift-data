Well, I'm a little biased being that I'm one of the members here; but seriously Eye Lounge exhibits some of the better up and coming artists in town.
A little plug for myself, come see my show there in November (it's in the west gallery Omer!
)  If any of you want a card, email me your address and I will send one right out to ya!

My friends and I agreed that this was the best gallery we saw on this particular First Friday in Phoenix.
Located conveniently next to Modified Arts, an attractive low-ceiling space showcased some of the more "advanced", "mature", and "developed" art were the words we came up with.
A smaller room, opened up to a much large space to the left and at the time there was a small installation in the backroom that was interactive and impressive.
Definitely a sophisticated gallery in a fantastic location, highly recommended.

I've never been disappointed.
I know three members, all superb artists.
I wish to be a member some day.
Sigh.

Always a gallery I hit.
Great space, always interesting art.
I've known many of the artists over the years and have seen practically every exhibit.

Great little space.
Go see the Christopher Jagmin show right now!!!
His colorful, slightly loopy encaustic paintings are a great reminder that life is fun, dammit, and art can be too!

Love stopping in here on First Fridays.
Usually love the pieces here.
I really liked the piece in the tiny back room during the March FF.
It made a great statement in a new way on our weight obsessed culture.

favorite of First Friday galleries - diverse blend of approachable and provocative art, nice representation of local/foreign artists.
enjoyed west lounge entirely dedicated to Logan Bellow's "Theories" exhibit.

One of my favorite Art Galleries on Roosevelt Row, a mandatory monthly stop for me.
