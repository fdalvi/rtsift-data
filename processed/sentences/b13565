Mario's is located on the NW corner of the 101 & 59th ave. in the Fry's shopping center (yelp map is inaccurate).
I've been 3-4 times and have haircut results that range from average to very good, depending on the stylist.
I can't recall my favorite barber's name but she is from the Chicago area, with accent and all.
She does a nice 100% scissors cut (none of this excessive use of electric clippers with #2 or #4 whatever, like they do at Supercuts).
Prices are reasonable.
Parking isn't a problem.
Only complaint is they're not always open on time in the morning.
I verified the posted hours and left after nobody showed up 10 mins.
after opening time.

Service was wonderful, they really do keep their promise of listening to what you want before they go ahead to cut like other places.
Staff greets you on entry, so friendliness is a definite plus here.
Easy to find, this place is in the Fry's plaza, and if possible, ask for Christina.
She does a great job, and gives great tips on how to maintain healthy, stylish hair.

-Haircut by Shanna  PROS: -she is meticulous -perfect cut -reasonable price  COMMENTS: -will be coming back

I've never been one to frequent hair salons.
I went here and was lucky to get Shana to figure out something for my longish 65 year old hairdo.
She went shorter and helped me learn how to style it at home.
I came back a few weeks later and went a little shorter again.
Shana will listen to what you want and will make suggestions, but it's your call.
I then took my daughter there, seen in the photo.
We are very pleased.

This place was so dirty, I couldn't wait to get  out of there.
The shampoo station was so gross.
I won't be going back!

Was a client of Mirtha's for years and was bummed when she left.
However, I've discovered Shanna!
Love, love, love her.
She's very meticulous with hair and listens to what you want.
She truly strives to make you happy, and her highlights are the best!
