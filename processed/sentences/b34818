Anytime I enter this shop I want to buy the whole lot up!
It's the first place I go to for work outfits.
They offer fun, youthful, and still classy options that you can't find at other places.
The prices are pretty affordable.
The shop itself is very relaxing and I feel very comfortable here.

Today my friends and I decided to go shopping today to treat ourselves and we landed in this cute store!
We met the cutest short haired blonde girl who was do much fun, she was so personable unlike everyone in all of the other stores at the mall who say hi quietly and walk away!
She was just the cutest girl ever and I will never forget that store because she made it memorable!

I love Francesca's and there cute clothing BUT I am not a fan of the customer service at this location.
I've been to many different Francesca's, Oregon, California, and here.
And this is the 1st location I had a bad experience.
I've been to this location many times, and have yet to encounter a nice welcoming person.
When I was in last night, I was the only person in the store and was not even acknowledged once.
The girls were to busy gossiping to be bothered with a customer.
I found a dress that I really liked, but decided not to buy the dress because of how unfriendly the girls were.
I can go to the location off Ray road, buy my dress and have a much better experience.
