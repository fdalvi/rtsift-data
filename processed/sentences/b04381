Like all Stein Marts, if you go and look around long enough, you'll run into something that you absolutely love and just also happens to be 90% off.
HOT DOG!!!!!

I love this store, shop here on a semi regular basis.
Everything from artwork to sexy panties, petite clothing, shoes, etc.
Don't always find what I want every time I stop by, but worth looking.
And for Penny Lane, I'm not a fancy old lady, just another shopper looking for petite clothes and other things for my home.
No one is forcing you to shop there.

Just opened yesterday!!!
Lots of selection.
Great items.
Better prices.
This place will be packed before too long - which will leave Ross across the street empty.
Get in early for the best selection.

I have to admit that I am a Stein Mart lover.
Moreover I'm a bargain shopping fiend.
For what it is, this place is great.
Kind of like a mix (in quality and selection) between Nordstrom's Rack and TJ Maxx.
You can really find some great deals here.
I'd say that the target shopper here is between 40 and 60+.
I'm not in that demographic YET but if you are in the market for some great golf/business casual apparel then this is your spot.
I'm a big fan of the Ben Hogan shirts.
Great quality and here you can get a $100 shirt for $30 or $40 bucks.
Last visit was a great one.
My wife found a REALLY awesome pea-coat for herself.
$250 bucks marked down to $60, then she used a 20% off coupon she found on the net.
Can you say SCORE!?...
Well I can.
Check it out.
You may find something you like.

When I need clothes or am shopping for gifts, I'll come here before I go to Sears or JC Penney.
I like this place.
People are friendly and they have nice stuff that's affordable.
