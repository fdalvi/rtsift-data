This place is THE place for choco-addicts.
The best, I'm talking major scrumpa-lumptious!
It's one of my favorite gifts to send.
Also good for custom corporate gifts.
My fav?
This is a hard one...how about my top 4...raspberry swirl, peanut butter, coconut and mint chocolate.

Best brownies in world, handcrafted from Callebaut dark Belgian chocolate, premium butter, farm fresh eggs, fluffy cake flour --   And, says the website -- "A dash of magic!
"   I am tempted to believe them.
I am a decent cook and have made my share of brownies (both from the box and from scratch).
Mine have never tasted like these.
So, magic?
Maybe...

These brownies aren't the best I've ever had But they're pretty darn close  I usually send these as presents to my friends in other states.
I oftentimes pick up a few at AJ's!
AJ's usually has a few different flavors of these brownies individually packaged near the checkout counters.
Me likey.
