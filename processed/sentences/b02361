So, we ordered 6 pizzas tonight for my son's b-day party.
They got 2 pizzas wrong.
We went back to complain and got attitude from them and no apologies.
Are we ever going back?
Nope.

Little Ceasars has gone back to a simple menu and kept prices down.
Really good place for a quick $5 pizza.
Staff seemed overwhelmed, but very friendly.
Do note, this is to-go only, no delivery or dining room.
Would definitely stop here again

I've been ordering from Little Caesar's for a long time.
For $5, you cant go wrong, I like the pizza, the service is fast and friendly and they'll make it "Crazy crust" or cook it well done on request.
They sure makes it easy to feed a family of four.

Low on cash, come here for dinner!
can't beat $5 ready pizzas, better than Costco pizza.
They also have a deep dish pizza for $8.
Drinks are a bit pricey so grab some 32 ozs from QT before heading here, lol.
Parking in front it okay, just hope you don't get there during primo dinner or lunch rush or you might have to wait for them to bake your pizza which isn't half bad because you'll get a fresh one rather than one that's been sitting in a warmer.
Yay!

I love Little Caesars but don't come to this location on Val Vista and Southern if you're starving or in a hurry.
It requires patience.
If their cheese bread weren't so addicting I'd probably just go somewhere else...
