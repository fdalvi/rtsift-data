Cultivated Lawn Services is easily the best landscaping service in our area.
Tyler is honest, fair, and his crew does a great job.
Highly recommend them

Called for a quote days ago and never got a call back.
Sorry, but if you can't return a phone call, then that's a big red flag about your customer service or lack thereof.

We wanted to replace our dead grass with sod, and after looking at the positive reviews here and on Google, I called Cultivated Lawn Services.
Even though Tyler was on vacation when I called, he took the time to give me a quote over the phone and talked to me about what type of grass would be best for my yard's level of sun exposure.
I liked the 'small company' feel that he gave me, and we setup a time for him to come by and accurately measure and estimate the job.
He was on time, and very professional.
His quote was on par with other estimates that I had received, so we setup the install date  On 'install day', the team arrived a little later than expected, but finished the sod install faster than expected.
They cleaned up after themselves very well, and we are very happy with the work performed!
