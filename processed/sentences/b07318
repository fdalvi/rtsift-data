Very knowledgeable and friendly staff.
Easy to make a quick appointment.

My husband and I have been going to Dr. Koko for years, and we completely trust him and his staff.
A friend of ours referred us, and we're so glad that she did!

This office has a very professional staff with wonderful hygienists who perform cleanings.
My husband and I have been going to this dentist for years, he is caring and thoroughly competent.
We moved 500 miles away three years ago and still use Dr. Kokodynski for all our dental work, he and his staff are that good.
