This GNC was convenient when I was searching for a juice cleanse recently.
The store seems to be a bit smaller than others I've seen.
The guy working on this day was helpful.
He greeted me as soon as I walked in the door; after I showed him a picture on my phone of what I wanted, he walked me over to exactly what I was looking for.
I like this location better than the one on Camelback in PHX.
It seems to be cleaner and the folks more helpful.

Pretty typical GNC.
Friendly staff and they carry just about everything.
This location was a little hard to find at first.
But just know that it's close to the safeway grocery store.
If your not buying online then this is a great place to pick up health products, proteins, etc.

I've never been to a "bad" GNC as their corporate standardization game is pretty tight.
Butttt.
They have, perhaps, upped the annoying sales pitches w/their associates.
Very.
Annoying.
I ran in for some GNC Lean bars this past weekend.
I politely declined when the associate asked if I needed help.
I took my box up to pay and he kept on and on about "educating" me on other products to try (along same brand line).
I kept on repeating, "No thanks, I'm good".
Then the GNC membership came up again - I declined.
Again, more spiel on members-only prices.
Blah, blah blah.
I tuned out.
Then, he might as well have crammed down a Women's Only Vitamin down my throat at the counter.
I took one, to shut him up.
I paid and practically ran out.
While I do appreciate his excitement and willingness to help, there is a thing as being pushy/overly sales-inclined.
The vitamin chew was horrid, I spit the thing out in the parking lot flower bed.
The Lean bars are great though!
