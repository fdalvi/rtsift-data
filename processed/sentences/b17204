I like the shoe and T-shirt selection.
there was only one guy working there at the time i stopped and since it was in the middle of the week and early in the day it was pretty empty.
The guy striked up some conversation and seemed like he was happy to answer any questions we had.
The pricing was on par with other places of this type.
The only thing i didn't like was that it was a little hard to find since the sign outside is pretty small.
I ended up driving past it a couple of times.
Ill diff.
check this place out again next time I'm in LV.

Any Sneakerhead or streetwear head would say, that Laced got you covered.
After hearing about this place 3 years ago, i still have trouble finding the place.
Heavy black limo tint windows cover the shop and the only thing that will help anyone find the place is the Small Jordan symbol.
Dope Spot, fresh gear (NikeSB, Alife,Stussy, Crooks n Castles, Rebook's, Af1's, J's,etc), customer service on point..
Helpful staff and nice layout.
One of the first sneaker/clothing boutiques in las vegas..

Cool spot with a lot of eye candy for the feet.
Hard place to find but definitely worth the work.
It's nice to find a shop like this.
Check it out and cop a fit.

Any place that still sells Alpha Numeric is awesome.
Also, I love the artwork all over the store.
It is also a plus that the staff is super friendly, too.
Laced is definitely a place to go to find colorful, funky stuff!!

A very well thought of store ins and outs.
great selections between clothing brands and shoes.
An alright costumer service is balanced out with their big screen tv equipped with a gaming console which you can play when your done shopping (well the last time I went atleast).
A must-stop-by for fashion/shopping.
