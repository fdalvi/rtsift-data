Great clean gas station.
Perfect for stopping on the way between Tucson and Phoenix.
They had Dt.
Dr. Pepper in the soda fountain which I thoroughly enjoyed.

Not bad.

This is my stop when I'm rocking the 10 east or west when traveling to Tucson.
Nice clean restrooms and they have a ton of drink and munchie options.
There's plenty of places to gas up as well.
