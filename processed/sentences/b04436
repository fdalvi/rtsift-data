Not bad as far as Subways go, clean setup, food tastes typical Subway, parking not bad.
Surprisngly though a lot of riff-raff customers for the area.
/sigh

Cheap, fast, and consistently delicious...definitely a regular stop for students in the area.

I've had Subway many times before moving to Arizona so I know they have good sandwiches.
However, I will never eat at this particular Subway.
My husband ordered two Turkey sandwiches to go and it was literally the worst sandwich I ever had in my life.
Stale bread, and something definitely funky with the turkey, cheese, and lettuce.
Like they used old ingredients.
I was sharing my sandwich with my 3 year old but after tasting it, I threw it in the garbage because I was afraid that we were going to get sick.
Will not try anything from there again.

We just walked in and then walked right out!
The employee that was working was coughing and sniffing and snorting all over the food!

I told the employee I would like extra cheese 3 times and I ended up with double meat.
I was the only customer in there and she seemed distracted.
When I got home i took a bite and thr bread just crumbled into pieces.
I will never return to this subway again.
