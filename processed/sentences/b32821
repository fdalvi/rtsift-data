The pool isn't heated so it's not enjoyable to swim in this time of the year.
The prices are kinda high & there are kids running around all crazy splashing everyone.
The view is AMAZING!
Wish the pool was heated would have given in 4 stars then.

Amazing!
This bar has the best staff in Vegas!
They remembered our group of girls from 3 years ago and we had to come stay at the stratosphere again because of the pool bar staff!
Matt is the most friendly and literally makes a drink like a champ!
The pool is really enjoyable and large and not over crowded which is nice.
We will be back in another 2 or 3 years to see him again!

I absolutely love this place.
We have stayed at the Stratosphere twice in the past 3 years and Level 8 is hands down the best pool bar/lounge out there.
The customer service is exceptional as well as the food and drinks!!
I come to this bar mainly because of Matt, the bartender.
He is wonderful and has the best personality.
He makes our visits so much fun and always remembers us!!
I wish all bartenders were as awesome as he is!!!!

Loveeee this place!
We've come to the pool everyday and have received great service, drinks and food.
Abe is by far the best bartender there!
He has a great personality and was so helpful.
He gave us tips on where to eat and where to hang out while we stayed here!
