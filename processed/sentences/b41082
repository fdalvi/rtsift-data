One question: Do you like/love baklava?
If you answered with a yes, then you must visit this place.
They have a huge assortment of freshly baked baklava and other middle eastern sweets.
We asked them too fill a plate for us with a selection of different baklava to take home.
They all taste wonderful and I'm so glad we found this place.

Wow!
Walked in to check this place out.
They have an assortment of middle eastern pastries.
They gave me about 5 to try for free.
So good!!!
They are opening a buffet later this week.
Will have to check that out too.
Highly recommend this place
