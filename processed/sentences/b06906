I can't believe I'm writing a review for Kohl's...
Caution: this store is really small.
I couldn't find much variety there.
They had really good clearance racks, but that is always hit or miss.
It's not that bad, but I would go to one of the other two in Madison before this one.

A Kohl's is a Kohl's is a Kohl's.
I really don't have much to add here.
I went to this store by chance has I needed to stock up on some warmer clothes.
I was impressed with the sale that they had going on; on the same hand the selection was fairly limited.
The staff was very friendly and helpful and there was plenty of parking.
I would not be opposed to going back.

I'm writing this review for one simple reason - I hate, hate, hate how much pressure Kohl's(and some other stores) put on customers to sign-up for crap after purchase.
Do you have a Kohls card?
Would you like a Kohls card?
Really?
You'd save $5.
Are you sure?
Really?
Ok.  -- Now imagine having this dialogue every single time.
It's like an annoying disclaimer in a movie that you can never skip and constantly have on repeat.
I've even answered before sarcastically that I prefer to only pay full price for everything.
I know the employees are instructed to do this but its just so annoying for myself that I have actually not gone because its just so irritating.
You already have my money - take it!
