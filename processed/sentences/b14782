Best shop I've ever been to very honest people and very inexpensive

Slowly improving my 1998 Jeep Cherokee.
Have had troubles with Chrysler/Jeep dealers, and my Toyota mechanics seem a little careless with the Jeep.
So, after a few interviews of Mark and Mike over the 2012/2013 year, I decided to upgrade the suspension on the Jeep.
Excellent so far!
Mark provided down-to-earth responses, high quality service, and a selection of parts that meet my needs.
I will return for Exhaust and wheel/tire selection next...more soon :)

I really like Mark and the crew here.
They have done shocks on my JK, new bumpers and tomorrow they install a rigid led light bar.
Every time they are more than fair on price and they do great work.
I have gone in there in the past with an idea on doing something and they have talked me out of it because they felt that I either didn't need it or it wasn't worth the money.
Gotta love their honesty.
I will keep coming back
