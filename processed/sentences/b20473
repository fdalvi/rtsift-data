I wanted to review this shop partly to give people top budgeting tip-bulk buy!
As a girl with lots of unmanageable hair (and a general cosmetics fan!
) i spend a fortune on hair products.
This place is great because once I found my favourite stuff I go here and go lareg which saves me loads.
This is one of the only shops in Edinburgh that has the full (and very, very beautiful!
) range of OPI nailcare and nail varnishes.
They have a massive rane of hair dyes so what I've done in the past is bought the stuff for a hairdresser friends to do instead of paying salon prices.
NB I do not recommend this if a)you don't trust your friend or b)you don't have a friend who is qualified!

What a stupid, pointless shop.
I popped in here on my way home from town today because I'd forgotten to pick up a hairbrush, and what a dumb idea that was.
For starters, if you're anything ore than a size zero you'll need to hold your breath in as you sidestep dow the ridiculously small aisles, otherwise you risk knocking everything off.
And if the thing you're looking for is on any other shelf than the top one, forget it.
That was annoying enough, but when I finally did find the hairbrush section the only one that looke vaguely like what I wante was nearly £10.
Not a chance, Sally.
Instead, I went to Boots further along the street and got a much better one for £2.
And I can't say I'll ever rush back to Sally again.

Sally Hair supplies has a lot of variety, and sometimes I'll stop in for a browse if I get the urge to do something adventurous (but end up leaving with hair baubles because I chicken out).
I don't really shop in here anymore but my mates used to swear by this chain when they were younger.
In my late teens I had a real urge to dye my hair blonde and although Sally's came up with the goods (and my adventurous friends were egging me on to do it) again, I bottled out (pun intended - I'm sorry) and got it done at the hairdressers instead.
I did buy pink dye from here once though, and it was good.
It was bubblegum pink and lasted for a few washes, which pinks and red dyes are not famed for doing.
It's got loads of intensive hairdressing supplies that professionals swear by.
On a small scale, it's a bit reminiscent of a hairdressing cash and carry.
There are some bargains to be found, but in some areas it can be pretty pricey as Fiona has highlighted.
I tend to just get all my beauty supplies out of Boots but if I ever get the urge to go nuts with my hair again, Sally's will always be here.
They also do a rocking range of vibrant nail polishes in wild colours, which I utilise on occasion.

Sallys was one of the many places I visited when I first arrived in Edinburgh, trying to find a place that could handle my hair!
It isn't a hair salon, but I was lucky enough to get a recommendation one of the staff, and that's my success story of how I found Eva's hair salon!
*Gushhhhh*  Now Sallys is more like a salon's stockist, and sells a lot of the professional looking products that are used by hair stylists.
They've got all sorts of hair colour, shampoos etc as well as some products for African hair, such as relaxers.
Unless you're a bit fussy about having the cutting edge products and accessories, Sallys can be ridiculously expensive, and it's probably better to head to Boots or Superdrug.
The only thing I can remember buying there were cloth waxing strips, a hundred of them for about £5!
That's a pretty good deal, and considering they're supposed to be reusable, I predict they just might last forever if I'm disciplined enough to indeed reuse.

Is your hair a mess?
Or your nails are split?
Who you gonna call?
Sallys!
Ok, I might be getting hair and beauty confused with ghosts and ghouls, but Sallys certainly has the same theme.
If you have split ends, chipped nail varnish, a few rogue eyebrow hairs, any beauty problem needing a superhero fix, Sallys is a great one-stop shop.
It has a lot of products you wont find elsewhere.
It's a little bit pricier, but man are the products good.
With my curly locks I have spent many a pretty penny in here trying to find the right products.
This branch isn't the biggest I've visited, although it has a fairly good selection.
The shop assistant was friendly, helped me find a mousse for my curls.
I think I've just been to bigger Sallys that had far more products for me to drool over / spend my pretty pennies on.
