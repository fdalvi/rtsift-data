I have never gotten the correct order here, and the DT wait is horrendous.
I go there weekly to buy ice & I often wait between 7-12 minutes in the drive-thru line.
Inside is usually overrun by unsupervised 13 yr olds.

The best in the business .
Always spotless friendly fast and tasty.
Good drive thru access and rite turn onto the highway.

Employees complaining about you for a custom order when you drive up, take over 8 minutes to bring it, act offended again when you tell them that they got the order wrong, and then hesitate to correct the problem.
The sad part is we have run I to similar problems with this location several times.

Usually pretty fast and the people are polite, the food is typical McDonalds fare (I do like the grilled wraps though).
This location is always clean and well kept as well.
Overall not bad
