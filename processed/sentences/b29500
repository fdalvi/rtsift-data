You can count on being pleased with the results with Lucky Shot Photography.
Meg is a pleasure to work with and has a great eye for composition.
She is also extremely patient and easy going.
This makes for a happy experience during the photo shoot.
Once you get your photos you won't be disappointed!

If you are looking for an amazing photographer at a very reasonable price then look no further...I can highly recommend Lucky Shot Photography.
Meg is such a doll, and is a pleasure to work with.
I had a great time during our mini photo session for my company (it was a last minute deal and of course everything was needed with an express turnaround time, and Meg delivered).
I can't wait to book another session to see what she comes up with next.

I hired Meg to do our newborn baby shots.
I was extremely impressed not only with the set up and her creativity with the shots but also the final results!
I will be using her again as our little guy progresses!!

I am so glad we chose Lucky Shot Photography for my maternity & our baby's newborn photos; Meg is simply amazing.
Her ideas for the photo shoots were beautifully creative, elegant and flexible.
She also handled our baby wonderfully - even taught us a few tricks to calm our baby!
It meant a lot for me to capture our baby's early moments and the pictures Meg created are gorgeous.
They couldn't have turned out any more perfect!
Thank you Meg!

We had Meg do our 6 month photos as well and considering how well she did with the previous shoots, it was no surprise she blew it out of the water!
I had no gameplan, just a few outfits - but Meg was prepared.
She captured incredible shots I wouldn't have thought of myself in a hundred years and now they are hanging on my walls!
