I've hired Don for several of my home improvement projects.
He has always arrived on-time and the price charged is what he estimated.
Don and his business partner, Bryan, work as a great team and it's obvious they have worked together for quite a while.
Don has also been nice enough to provide me with some referrals for projects not in his scope of work so I appreciate his willingness to help me out even when it's not direct business for him.
I felt more like a family member rather than just a customer for Don and I appreciated how personable and friendly he was.
Thanks guys!

Recently, we needed some repair work done on the exit door in our garage.
We called four contractors to get bids; Don responded first and scheduled an appointment the next day.
He came on time and submitted a written estimate that same day.
The work was completed in a timely way, and at exactly the price estimated.
Work was outstanding in quality.
We would use them again.

I've both personally used Don at KMI Contracting and referred him to countless clients, for everything from major renovations to minor to-do lists.
And every referral I've sent his way has said he did a great job.
He's extremely up-front and honest about what the job will need, and I've never had a "surprise" come up.
Of course I assume once any contractor starts digging into a job there are bound to be unknown issues they find, but I've never had it with KMI, and I would think that's because his level of knowledge about his work is so high that he would be better suited to predict the potential hidden issues.
I never think twice about calling KMI when I have a need for a contractor or when a client asks for the name of a contractor I trust.
