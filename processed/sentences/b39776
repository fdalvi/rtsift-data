Super good Chinese restaurant !!!
I come from NYC ...feels like make me home!!!
Sweet !!!!!

This is the worst restaurant ever, worst food, worst customer service .
Very dirty, the cups have a weird smells .And totally rip off!
We didn't order much food total came out $87 for 4 people!!

Food and service were not special.
To me this is a very annoying place!
We were the only customer there at that time.
I think the owner's friends and families sat next to us.
They were talking very loud while we were there.
It is very bothering us!
Violated our enjoyment.However, nobody seems to care.
I hope you can find a better comforter place to dine.
I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone.

This place is a diamond hidden in a Chinatown  strip mall.
Flavorful and delicious!!!
Must try dish:  Boiled fish with pickled cabbage and chili Salted duck Beef noodle soup Chicken gizzard with wild peppers
