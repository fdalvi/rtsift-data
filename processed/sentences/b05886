I ordered from the website for this location.
Luckily enough it also gives you a tracker to tell you where your pizza is in the process.
Unfortunately for them it showed me that the pizza was out of the oven and sitting in the store for about 30 minutes before it even left with the delivery driver.
I don't mind waiting for pizza, but I do not expect it to be 40 minutes old by the time it gets to me.
On top of that I complained and was told that they would give 2 LG free on my next order and the credit was on my account (ph#) wouldn't you know....
I call and nothing was there no credit, no nothing.
Lucky for me that there lots of other choices for good pizza in the area.

Very good pizza & a very clean/professional resteraunt

Try the Habanero Wings.
They are great!
Quick service.
Great computer system to follow order.

Very poor Service... Has a 42 minute wait when they had said that it was gonna be a 20 minute wait.... Never again I will order from Dominos at all.

My favorite Dominos location!
I've ordered several times, both delivery and carryout, and I've been pleased with every order.
I've carried out at different locations such as the one on Simmons and Lake Mead in North Las Vegas (don't go there.. they make their food so sloppily) and no one is as good as them.
My favorites there are the mango habanero wings, chicken alfredo bread bowl, lava cakes, (OMG yummmmmmy) and their hand tossed pizza with chicken and bacon.
I seriously eat there every week.
I'm going to blow up, but I'll blow up satisfied haha!
