...and then you gotta have good food.
Well this snazzy-yet-inexpensive restaurant served me up the best breakfast I've had outside mom's Sunday fare, for an astonishingly low price.
Not greasy, carefully pan-cooked seasoned potatos and scrambled eggs, and yup, toast CAN be that good.
On approach I thought I was going to an East Coast Panera Bread, or a friendly neighborhood albeit overpriced Paradise Bakery, but then I open the doors to a cavernous living room with a baking problem.
And if anyone from Wildflower is reading this, can you fix the annoyingly tippy table we sat at outside with one leg missing the rubber pad?
***UPDATE: Table was fixed promptly the next day!
***  Also, they bus the tables there, so just leave your plate where it is when you leave.

Glad to have a Wildflower location open up by my work.
It's a good alternative to Paradise Bakery.
The two have pretty similar concept.
They just opened up here about a month ago and I have probably grabbed lunch here 8-9 times already.
My favorites are the cream cheese potato soup and the wildflower salad.
I usually get the wildflower two (choose two from any: soup, salad, or half sandwich) Also the blackberry/orange lemonade is really good.
I've tried two different sandwiches and thought they were okay.
What brings me back each time is that potato soup!
The sourdough bread that comes with it is good as well.

Had the new Haddock sandwich.
Very tasty!
Nice addition to the sandwiches and pastas.
The value here is fantastic - no entrees over $9 and amazing bread.
No white tablecloths, but if you're looking for a casual atmosphere and really quality food, this is the place.

I finally had the chance to eat at the new Wildflower location today and all I can say is bravo Wildflower.
Another job well done.
First, the location.
This area needed a Wildflower badly and I plan on adding this to my weekend rotation immediately.
Wildflower went above and beyond for the customer's needs at this location.
Did you know that each booth has multiple power outlets so that you can plug your computer in from pretty much anywhere in the restaurant?
For anyone who works on the go, they know how much of a godsend this is.
If a shop doesn't have enough power outlets, they can lose customers quickly because a computer battery only lasts so long!
The restaurant is incredibly spacious and even though there was a line out the door, I found a seat right away because it's big enough to accommodate the large crowds.
So speaking of large crowds, apparently Scottsdale got the Wildflower memo because it was swarming with lunch goers!
But the Wildflower staff did a fabulous job with getting each customer in and out in an efficient manner.
They didn't rush anyone but they knew how to handle the crowd.
Once I got through the line, I was impressed with the friendly and fast service.
Like other Wildflower locations, the food is fabulous as usual.
The bread is fresh and soft.
And the salads and sandwiches are still tasty.
Today, I noticed adorable mini cakes in the case.
They would make for a perfect miniature birthday cake for a friend or coworker!
I also noticed the arrival of pumpkin chocolate chip muffins.
Let pumpkin season begin my friends!

All things considered, I put this place even with Paradise Bakery as far as a solid lunch place with good sandwiches and salads.
Neither place is perfect but when I add together the positives and negatives of each; they come out even.
In all fairness though, I've only been to Wildflower 2-3 times, but I've been to Paradise more times than I care to count.
Wildflower has a much bigger selection of salads and sandwiches than Paradise with is nice because Paradise always has the same stuff and it really never ever changes.
Wildflower's menu seems to be very fresh.
Wildflower has a good selection of salads, sandwiches and cookies along with a friendly and clean atmosphere.
The other day I had one of their 1/2 sandwich and 1/2 salad specials.
I got the roast beef and Gorgonzola with a side Ceasar.
The sandwich was ok but pretty impossible to eat without making a complete mess.
The salad was also very good but had too much dressing on it.
My wife got the chopped salad which was excellent and very unique.
I think they stole it from Cowboy Caio.
I would like to go back soon and try some more sandwiches and salads and maybe some of their breakfast stuffs.

a medium-quality sandwich/bakery place.
No better than Panera, can still get a good turkey sandwich here.
good place when you need to grab lats minute cookies for a potluck or a loaf of bread...

As I sit here stuffed from my butternut squash ravioli sipping my blackberry orange lemonade  I am wondering what other delishness can they cook up?
Casual place with some basic and some finer options for lunch or dinner though both times I have frequented for late lunch.
I would like a little better assortment of fresh pastries and desserts but I can always stop by Paradise or sprinkles on my way home!
If your in the area...try  one of these places.

Wildflower is a great unique place that serves up excellent breakfasts and lunches.
Their portion sizes are huge so be prepared to be uncomfortably full or take some home with you.
They are so much, and I can't stress this enough, so much better than Paradise Bakery.
They even have delicious baked goods.
One of my favorite things to do is go on a bike ride with my girlfriend and stop there for lunch or a late breakfast.
They also have great coffee so go to them instead of the Starbucks around the corner.
My favorite sandwich is the Chicken Pesto which I usually customize to suit my particular needs.
I'm kind of a food snob.

Fair warning: The potato cream cheese soup is deadly!
Just a whiff of it, and I can already taste the smooth, rich, tangy goodness.
The proof: Saturday, someone's kid was slurping away on this soup while I was getting a manicure and, Sunday, I was compelled to find a Wildflower for family brunch.
Thank goodness for this new location as it is convenient from church.
(Tip: On our first visit, we saw The Big Unit himself chowing down with his girls!
)   We can save Wildflower for the occasional Sunday brunch, but if there were one closer to home, I'm sure I'd be eating there a lot more regularly!

I am going to take an uneducated guess that ALL of the locations are delish...I just ate at this location today (and how did I NOT know there was one close to me?
) and again had the Double R Chopped Salad...hold the corn and peppers, please.
This salad is very large for me (even my hubby can't eat a whole one) but it's so reasonably priced, who cares?
It has the freshest greens, rare roast beef (that actually tastes like roast beef...), carrots, celery, jicama, red onions, marinated mushrooms, gorgonzola cheese with blue cheese dressing.
It is FAB!
This location is quieter than Arcadia, but it's set up a little differently and buffers some of the sound (?..I have no idea but it's a guess).
EVERYONE is very nice, smiles, and I believe, really cares that you have a great experience.
Quite a departure from some places...and a nice departure, at that!
I am vowing to try the (limited time) braised beef sandwhich very soon and update the review, but this place is rock solid delicious!
Oh, by the way, the bread is WONDERFUL!

I can't get enough of Wildflower Bread Company!
Can you tell?
Did you know they use wild Alaskan salmon in their salads,etc?
Did you know they use cage-free, antibiotic-free, hormone-free chicken in their chicken dishes?
Always very fresh, always consistent, delicious food--and that's as close to perfect as a restaurant can get!
I finally tried something a little different today: 1/2 roast beef and gorgonzola sandwich and 1/2 Caesar salad...FABULOUS!
Every bite was pure deliciousness!
Although I'm trying to cut the sweets, I'm going to indulge in a cupcake or a piece of cake next visit....they look wonderful, as well!
This place ROCKS!

Went for lunch  on a cool cloudy day and WBC had just the item...Chicken Parmigiana.
Moist chicken, flavorful marinara and plenty of melted cheese on their perfectly toasted french bread.
YUM!
My new favorite place for this dish.

This place was packed and I was completely unimpressed.
You stand in line for you meal, order, take your marker to the table and you're served.
Not so bad, as I was looking for a light salad-type lunch.
I ordered the chop-chop salad which was ok.
The salad has wild Alaskan salmon, arugula, Israeli couscous, feta, red peppers, dried sweet corn, dried cranberries and sunflower seeds served with Pesto Vinaigrette.
We also had the Emerald Spinach salad with chicken which was better.
This salad has spinach, gorgonzola, bacon, red onion, spicy pecans, oranges, strawberries and red grapes with Balsamic Vinaigrette.
Ambiance note: There's a Yelp and Facebook ad on every table.
Seriously, the ambiance was institutional and very chain-like.
It's a baby magnet and the acoustics are horrible as the metal ceiling caused the noise to bounce all over making for a really loud place to eat.
Last, there's a bakery, but I honestly thought the bread was boring, bland and too tough of a crust.
This place may get a second chance, but only for take-out and no more Chop Chop salad.
Portions are reasonable, but a far better salad is served at Paradise Deli with a lot more substance.

It's like Panera, but better.
Came here a few times when we were visiting for spring training.
For breakfast, we all really enjoyed the lemon ricotta pancakes.
Not overwhelmingly cheesy or lemony, simple yet tasty.
The blueberry compote is the perfect sweetness to match the light acidity of the pancakes.
Delicious.
Also, the walnut banana pancakes are quite good, as is the banana bread.
The frittata, however, was not very good.
A little overcooked and extremely earthy.
The staff was kind enough to refund the frittata, however.
In addition, depending on how busy they are, the wait time for the food can be a while.
We waited over 20 minutes for our breakfast, and then it came out separate.
Since this isn't really a sit down place, that seemed like a long time to wait.

It was really good!
The bread is fresh and I love there broccoli and cheddar soup!

I've had a few breakfast meetings here, and really like the location (although not really on Scottsdale Rd, it's on Indian Bend across from the Railroad Park, but easy to find with plenty of parking).
Plenty of electrical outlets and wifi make it a good place to work and nibble on the free bread samples and get coffee'd up while waiting.
I've been unable to tear myself away from the feta and tomato eggs, I love the way the flavors play off each other.
And the bread is great, tastes like someone actually baked it.
And there's always more coffee... With Jacqueline's gone, it's my go-to breakfast meeting location in this part of town (or Coffee Roastery...)

Food here is very good, but the people who work here are dumb as rocks, really its sad.
But quality is good and so are the free samples of bread which I can butter up and get crazy with in a scrumptious way.
Also they have a full coffee bar so you can get your espresso on and get back to work running on all cylinders!

I love this place.
What a great healthy breakfast at great prices?
I get the egg breakfast for a little over $5.
This is a comes with potatoes, toast, and two eggs.
Simple but delicious.

Even though the Pima location is still my favorite.
I had a great time here, too.
After playing in the park with the twins, it was an easy decision to just go across the street and have an early lunch.
My kids love the meatballs, and I liked my turkey ruben very much.
I still wish they would have the long booths as they do at the Pima location.

Solid place.
Great food.
Terrific breakfast and salads.
I like their new meatball sandwich too.
Why only 3 stars?
For 7 years now I've been a giant (figuratively speaking :-) fan of their pumpkin chocolate muffins.
They used to be so yummy and moist.
But everyone of them that I've tried in the past 8 months has been dry.
So frustrating, so disappointing.

Wildflower bread company is such a wonderful restaurant.
I pop in for a quick meal fairly often as I live across the street.
The ingredients are always fresh, healthy, and delicious!
You order at the counter and then sit wherever you like and they bring your food out to you.
The staff is always extremely polite and eager to help, which is great  to see.
The restaurant is decorated with beautiful blown glass artwork by Newt Grover.
The style is casual but still very nice.
There is a great patio and plenty of seating indoors as well.
There are fresh made breads and pastries daily that are yummy!
I like to take the children I nanny here when we are headed to the train park as an alternative to the food there, as it is very conviniently located across the street.
They enjoy sharing the meatballs and grilled cheese, as well as the fruit bowl.
My favorite dish- the Sausage & Egg Sandwich, which has scrambled eggs, sausage, green onion, roasted red pepper, cheddar and cilantro on a buttered Ciabatta Roll...
It's only 4.89, which is about what you might spend at a fast food restaurant on breakfast so why not stop by here and get something delicious instead?!
It's always big enough for me to take half of it home too, which is wonderful to look forward to later.

Ahh the iced tea, YUM!
Everything we've tried has been awesome and we've been going to Wildflower for years!
Love their new location at Indian Bend also!
The kids LOVE the meatballs and I'm always a fan of anything Wildflower Chicken.
Keep up the great work!!
Always on the lookout for great deals!

Cuban chicken sandwich was delicious, only wish the one side of the toasted rye wasnt soggy.
The Orzo was enjoyed by my 18 month old!
She loved it!
Iced tea is always the best, love the new refillable cups!

Average chain food + good bread = 3 stars  I don't avoid this place but I go somewhere else if I can.

I'm a big, big fan of Wildflower.
They are fast, fresh and delicious.
They have scrumptious bread, fresh salads and the soups are to die for.
The BLT is my favorite,  thick bacon and "always fresh" avacado.
The Lobster Bisqe is the real deal with large chunks of meat in it.
It's so good I eat it for breakfast.
This particular location has a great patio when the weather allows and the pandora stations they play only slightly suck.
Indoors each booth has power outlets and people are always busy working away.
How cool is that.
Yea it's corporate and a chain but lower your nose, it rocks.
The ice tea is amazing, I always buy a bag to brew at home.
Delicious!

The sandwich wars are over!
Wildflower has vanquished Paradise Bakery.
At least in my mind :)  The sandwiches here are much more intricate and creative than the other guys.
My current favorite is the turkey pastrami.
It comes on a nice toasted rye bread with a mango coleslaw.
The mixed potato and sweet potato chips that come with it are just the right side.
Always clean and the friendliest service in the Valley.
Well done Louis and team.
You guys rock!

Wildflower Bread Company has grown on me through the years... What I first considered to be just another chain, has proved it's quality and provided plenty a pleasant dining experience both when dining solo and in groups.
Due to this convenient WBC location, I've been here quite a few times over the past few weeks, and I always leave satisfied!
Lately I've been a fan of their chopped salad and chicken salad.
I'm currently eating for two and their portions are large enough to fill me up.
The bread is fresh and delicious.
I'm also a fan of their lemonade but I wish they offered refills.
While I enjoy the fast-casual concept of ordering at the counter and having your food delivered to you, this seems to be a hot spot during lunch and it's sometimes challenging to find a table.
I'm sure it will be better once the weather cools down a bit so people can take advantage of the patio seating.
I learned today that this location also has a dining area that can blocked off for more "private dining" for groups.
I may just have to look into that in the future.
Keep up the good work, WBC - I'm sure I'll see you again soon.

you have got to try their mango frozen lemonade.
their carrot cake and ham and cheese grilled sandwich are sooo good!

*******REVIEW UPDATE*********  The Owner of WildFlower wrote me a very kind e-mail expressing concern over my bad experience.
We had a couple of very kind exchanges and a very pleasant phone call.
I am excited to come back and give Wildflower another go.And no, I am not accepting free food.
Louis offered to make a charitable donation to a breast cancer charity in my friend's name instead.
I am upping this two stars automatically.
I'll happily give it another shot.
On my own dime.
Another review to follow.
*************************************  It's fairly uncommon for me to write a 1 or 2 star review, because I am a generally positive person when it comes to my Yelp finds.
This morning, I woke up after a fantastic night, and I figured, why not try Wildflower.
It seemed to be an Arizona institution and had some great reviews on Yelp.
Why not?
I walked in, and everything seemed like it was on par.
Clean establishment.
Plenty of small booths, with power outlets, free wi-fi, the whole nine-yards.
This morning, I ordered a "Sausage and Egg Breakfast Sandwich" which is: "scrambled eggs, sausage, green onion, roasted red pepper, cheddar and cilantro on a buttered Ciabatta Roll.
"  I sat down and waited.
And waited.
I was starving, but like a true English gentleman, I waited patiently some more.
Finally, 14 minutes later, as I was about to get up and say something, my food arrived.
Now, on the menu, the sandwich sounded good, but it just didn't work in the execution phase.
The Ciabatta was mushy, and gooey.
Rather gross.
The eggs were overcooked, and dry, and everything just seemed very....inedible.
My fantastic morning quickly turned miserable because of this horrid sandwich.
I don't see myself ever coming back here after this experience, especially since there are so many other breakfast options in the area.
I'd much rather drive down the street and brave traffic and parking issues in Old Town and grab something from the Sandwich Club...and get something far superior.

This may be the longest Yelp review in the history of written form, so I apologize.
It's worth reading.
Please share.
After my last experience, Louis, the founder/owner of WIldflower contacted me about my review.
He didn't pull an Amy's Baking on me.
He was very kind, caring, and asked me very specific questions about what happened last time.
We even spoke on the phone and had a lengthy conversation about it.
It was very nice to get to know him, and understand his passion for good food, and great service.
We also talked about some of Wildflower's charitable work with some non-profit groups like Komen.
He was very concerned about my bad experience, and wanted to make things right.
Not just by giving me my money back, but by fixing what was wrong.
By the end of our conversation, I offered to come back to the restaurant on my own dime, with no expectations for my money back.
I told him that I did appreciate the kind gesture.
A week later, in the mail, I received a refund, a gift card for one meal, AND a receipt for a very generous donation to the Komen foundation.
Earlier, I had told him about a friend who was a breast cancer survivor.
I was moved by this donation.
Today, I went back to Wildflower, and used my gift card.
So in full disclosure, I write this review.
I ordered the a sandwich with roasted sweet potato, fresh mozzarella, fig confit, tomato, arugula, marinated fennel and Balsamic Vinaigrette on Herb Focaccia.
It was like heaven on a plate.
The mozza and fig confit was the pairing that is a match made in heaven.
Think Stockton and Malone.
Jordan and Pippen.
Jay Z and Beyonce.
Donny and Marie.
Yeah.
That freaking amazing.
The Focaccia was pillowy soft and a delight.
I want more.
On the side, I had the passion mango slaw.
It was simply....great.
This was one of the rare occasions that I enjoyed a sandwich without ordering meat.
I was shocked, but I was feeling adventurous.
I am really sad about leaving Scottsdale, because this is one place I honestly could see myself visiting weekly.
Last time, I complained about the long wait.
Perhaps it's due to the high quality.
I'm not sure what happened last time.
Maybe it was an off-morning.
Read all the other reviews.
They are fairly consistent.
I am very happy with my return to Wildflower.
I am very glad I gave it another shot.
Louis, you are a great businessman, and your breadheads are fantastic people.
When I come back to visit Scottsdale, I will pay you a visit.

Love this place!
Wildflower is my go-to place for lunch in the area.
They have a huge selection of great sandwiches and salads and the portions are huge.
My favorite salad is the chopped salad, rivals all others that I've had.
The only thing that would make it better is if the salads had the option to have sliced avocado on it (you can add avocado, but it's the avocado that's already mashed up and used as a sandwich spread.
)   They have great breakfast too!
The Scottsdale location is great - big, lots of booths, and a large outdoor seating area.
It is much more relaxed than some of the other locations and they have great service.
Every time I have been there, there is a good amount of seating available.

If you like interesting and innovative soups, salads, sandwiches this is the place.
Fresh and healthy choices with daily and seasonal specials.
The handcrafted artisan bread to-go is fantastic - 9 grain was my choice today.
Staff was friendly and service was quick.
A welcome change to traditional drab & predictable sandwich shops.

I need to not forget how yummy wildflower is.
Had the oatmeal this morning.
Broke up the cinnamon raisin crouton on top.
Delicious !
I wonder how yummy the pancakes are.

I'm going to have to say I got excited to see one pop up by my work yay.
Love the one by 101 and Beardsley.
Will be checking this one out hadn't been in forever hoping they have the mix grill and wiildflower salad with the peach smoothie love it.

Wildflower Bread Company is like Pandera Bread or Cosi on steroids.
Everything is simply better and doesn't cost more.
i had a chicken pesto sandwich with pumpkin soup for lunch.
wow.
wow.
wow.
A real chicken breast right there in my sandwich with a fresh roll around it, not chucked nor reformed nor anything but tasty and real.
The pesto was excellent.
the soup had vegetable chunks and slices in it that were NOT mushy.
yum yum yum.
i went back for breakfast.
i had pouched eggs, bacon, french toast.
yes, i had a meal of left overs too.
The french toast was even better later, when it wasn't so hot and i could taste how delicious the bread is.
The staff is clean and friendly offering excellent service.

Great food, really good prices!
Cream cheese potato soup yes yes!!!!!
I like this location because it has a ton of seating.
Usually at other locations it is nearly impossible to find a table, at this location I always find one.
My only complaint is that every time I have come here they only have one cashier working, and usually the line is super long to order.

I was surprised at this place.
I was expecting it to be a Panera Bread with just a different name, like so many have done.
This menu was much better!
Much more selection and it seemed you could get more for the price.

Love that they have full hot breakfasts, not just reheated breakfast sandwiches.
Best part is the thick buttered fresh toast.
I placed my order at the register, and a few minutes later, my eggs/potatoes/toast was delivered to my table, hot and delicious.
Large portion as well, so good value.
The staff walks around cleaning and asking if everything is ok.
The rest of their menu looked great- i got to try the chopped salad that was wonderful with very fresh ingredients...wish I had a chance to try more before I left Arizona.
This location was spacious and has outdoor seating.
Sooooo much better than Panera Bread.

Went for lunch today, first time ever.
I looked at the menu beforehand so I knew that I was going to order the grilled cheese.
Upon arrival, the parking lot was jammed full, took me a loop around before I could even park.
It was very crowded but the line wasn't too long.
The girl was nice when I ordered-it was odd that they don't have regular iced tea (she DID offer to give me a cup with hot tea and ice though-I declined) oh And she Asked me if i wanted utensils, as thought i was expected to slurp up my potato salad with my fingers or something...that was really weird.
anyway, it took FOREVER to get my order (to go) I even had to go up and ask if my order had gotten lost..now sitting down to eat, everything looks decent.
My grilled cheese tastes pretty good, but the bread, 9-grain, almost broke my tooth on all the grains.
And the arugula was a little soggy (probably due to the wait time)The potato salad was delicious though, I'd definitely want more of that.
I'll have to switch sandwich types if I ever go back though.

I was staying across the street at the Plaza Resort and stumbled upon this place when I was driving around looking for a breakfast place other than Starbucks.
It kinda reminds me of a fancier version of Panera Bread.
Their prices are reasonable and the food is good.
I had their stuffed french toast, sausage & egg sandwich, egg breakfast and parfait.
Service was friendly but just a tad bit slow.
Overall, I was happy and so were my kids.
Oh yeah, and they offer free wi-fi.

Not sure I like the layout of this Wildflower as much as the one on Pima or Indian School, but the same quality coffees, sodas, and goods as well as glass sculptures and free Wi-Fi are all present and accounted for.
The double-sided center island simply creates for too much "carry-over" noise, particularly when children are present.

Quite a charming place to dine!
Think of paradise bakery...but way better!
Excellent house coffee.
I look forward to visiting again :)

This is the best Wildflower location in the NE Valley, and like the others, the menu crushes anything similar at Paradise Bakery.
Taylor Ham & Egg is still the benchmark breakfast sandwich and they usually have Ethiopian Yrgacheff coffee, which is all killer, no filler.

I live nearby and just ventured over to Wildflower for my first lunch!
What a pleasant surprise!
The food is great-ingredients fresh, bread fantastic and the meatball sandwich my husband ordered-"one of the best.
" It was a busy Saturday and lots of kids and families were there, but no waiting in line to take our order and the food was at the table in less than 10 minutes.
I will definitely be a regular-the prices were great and food was memorable!
I like salads and the choices were amazing-I had the salmon chopped salad and it was delicious!

Chopped Salad Rocks!
Love the way it's plated up with all ingredients lined up in rows, dressing on side to add as much as you want and the awesome bread on the side too!!
The sausage and egg sandwhich in the morning is also perfect brunch fare.

I have eaten here a few times, great service and food.
Also great atmosphere with nice patio area.
I recommend the soup and sandwhich combo.
My favorite soup here is the French Onion, but there many good options.
On the sandwich side you cant go wrong with any of there options.

This location is very nice and always has great take out service.
I usually go with the hummus plate and one of the soups.
The bread that they give with their salads are definitely worth the drive!
The cupcakes are sub--par so don't waste your money on them!

Love the outdoor fireplace on the cool winter nights!
It was great, to sit and chat over a hot cup o sumpin'  It would be really nice if there was a small live music jazz trio playing next to the crackling fire pit.

I ordered a vegetarian and gluten-free soup from this location and got home and had a chicken chili that was not gluten-free.
Not only is this horrible customer service and attention to detail, but it is dangerous to customers that have a gluten allergy.
I will NOT be coming back.

After hearing everyone speak so highly of Wildflower on a recent trip to Scottsdale, I was excited to give this place a go.
A group of six of us dined here for a quick breakfast before heading to a meeting.
I ordered a Wildflower Cappuccino and the two-egg breakfast.
The cappuccino was not memorable and the food was decent, nothing that myself or any of my dining companions felt was extraordinary.
I would love to give this place another go, perhaps try their lunch selection in hopes of more variety and creativity in their food offering.
The pros were the service was very quick and our group was able to secure a large table in a semi-cornered area for business talk before our meeting.
We definitely appreciated the privacy and the great service is always a plus!

Pretty corporate place.
Like a panera.
Good breakfast Sammy, nice service but nothing over the top nice about the place.
Good for refueling.

My week is not complete, until I've had a chopped salad from Wildflower!
It is my favorite lunch EVER!!!

This place is great.
Whenever my order is wrong its fixed no problem and often offered a complimentary dessert to help smooth the situation.
The staff is friendly, helpful and looks actually happy to be working there!
I'd definitely love it if their vegetarian soup selection was more often but I am very satisfied with what I have had there.
I have not ever had a bad experience there.
I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a quick place to get some quality food with actual customer service!

Cindy the catering manager, Casey, and Trish (assistant managers) were wonderful!
I just had a baby shower earlier this afternoon, and they had everything ready and blocked off for me when I arrived an hour and a half before party time to set up.
They were accommodating, friendly, fast, and the room was beautifully kept and easy to set up.
They even let us bring in more tables from other areas in the dining room, as well as bring in a couple of my own things for food.
I highly recommend Wildflower if you plan on having a small get together - they know what they're doing, the food is wonderful, and they are all super nice!
Thank you so much Cindy, Trish and Casey!

This is a great lunch option with a variety of options and you don't have to deal with a waiter.
My only complaint is that they periodically phase out a lot of the great lunch sandwiches, so I end up reverting back to the meatball sandwich.
The most recent one they phased out was the braised beef; there was another one before that -- forgot the name.

Clean restaurant, friendly staff.
The food is good when they get my order correct, which is about half the time.
I usually order my food to go and it sits on the food counter waiting to be bagged longer that it should.
The pastries are usually dried out from sitting in the open.
The breakfast is good.

let me simply start off by this place is way better then paradise bakery.
The food portions are great along with the quality.
I ordered the turkey pastrami, and it was delicious.
Even though it looked packed, i quickly ordered my food, and the wait was just right.
The service, the atmosphere was just right.
I have no negative comments about this place.
I will return to try other things on their menu, and im looking forward to another visit.

Absolutely love this place.
We eat here a few times a month and the food is always yummy and service is always great.
Staff is super friendly.
I wish I remembered to look at the girl's name who helped us the last time we stopped in.
She was engaging, funny and not at all frustrated by the fact that we came in 10 minutes until close.
(We were getting food to go and thought they were open until 10.
We aren't usually THOSE people.
) But like I said, she was cheerful anyway and had us laughing and smiling.
A huge plus is the variety!
Lots of vegetarian options and it's always hard to decide what to get.
I highly recommend the pasta primavera, hummus plate and the soup bread bowls!

I was here for my Kiwanis (Downtown Scottsdale Young Professionals) Club meeting in their community room in the back of the restaurant, it's a great place for a meeting if you didn't have a lot of people, however, we had a big turnout and the room was a bit tiny for us.
However, we had a great meeting and got a lot of works done.
I didn't try any of the food there because I wasn't really hungry, but I will definitely go back again there soon.

My husband just moved to Scottsdale fromVirginia and we were looking for a quick, but good quality place for lunch... And this is it!
Friendly staff, fresh food, and quick service.
The hummus plate is huge.
My husband got the sweet potato sandwich with fig and fresh mozzarella...
It was amazingly good (and great portion too).
We will be back!

I love that you can review the menu online and see the nutritional information for the items as prepared and if you omit ingredients.
I had the Turkey Waldorf salad, modified to be gluten-free and with lower calories and it was delicious.
It was so fresh and flavorful and the portion was huge (which I love).
I loved that even with a full restaurant it wasn't so loud that you couldn't hear your dining partners.

Love Wildflower.
I had the sweet potato sandwich--it was delish!
I have never had a bad meal at this Wildflower location.
They also have free wi-fi.

Love this place, it has the best potato cheese soup ever.
And Erin that works the register was so sweet, she made sure I got the last bread bowl.
The chocolate croissants are wicked good,

I simply must thank you for the superior service I received while dining at your establishment last Friday .
You staff(Asian lady) went above and beyond to make sure our experience was the best it could be.
Not only we did ask to change tables twice, but we inconvenienced her by asking her to change our food.
She took it all in stride and never treated our party with anything less than the utmost professionalism.
It is service like this that will keep us coming back to your restaurant again and again.
She thank us for providing her an opportunity to serve.
She said our ongoing commitment is to always treat you like a valued member of  the Wildflower family.
Our managers are expected to do what it takes to ensure our guest leave delighted.
Impressive!

Service was excellent but the food was just OK.
It was very busy during lunch and was hard to get a table.
We attempted to get two tables but other rude people jumped in front to claim it.
I'll pass on this place next time.

If you're looking for something in the fast casual arena, you could do much worse than Wildflower.
The service was very good, none of the food blew my socks off, but it was all good.
I'd definitely choose this over most of the competition.

If you've never been to Wildflower before, it's a cute, nice soup, sandwich, salad, bread, pastry place.
This is a big, bright location.
Lovely, savory food that always seems to be made with nice ingredients, and great bread - we often come in for a meal and treat ourselves to a loaf of something delicious to go - today, sourdough with rosemary and sea salt.
It's pretty reasonably priced, and the food is interesting.
Try the spinach salad (I get it with no bacon), or the egg, tomato & feta breakfast sandwich on ciabatta.

My wife had the tuna sandwich and I had a roast beef sandwich.
They both tasted awful.
They go out of their way to be distinctive with different ingredients but we prefer the basic sandwiches and didn't care for these at all.
Left without eating most of them.

Stopped in here before flying home.
The reviews looked good and the sandwiches were spectacular.
I told them I was in from out of town and they gave me some home fries to try because I said they looked good.
The pretzels were huge and awesome, so we're the chocolate chip cookies.
All the cashiers were smiling and helpful.
The cost was premium but very well worth it!
Great job Wildflower!
BTW, we ordered the Roast Beef, Ham & Cheese, BLT and one other.
Everyone said they were great.

My experiences at wildflower bread co. Have been nothing but extraordinary.
The food is is great, staff is amazing, and customer service is by far the best I've experienced at a café.
I would recommend This place to anyone.

Whenever in Arizona, this is a must visit spot.
Food is fresh, service friendly and a cut above those chains.
It's not a typical breakfast brunch spot but it has never disappointed this foodie from Boston!

It is very sad to know that you close before your posted closing times on Sundays.
We came in just before 8:00 on Sunday night.
Two young men told us that they were already closed.
I think they just wanted to go home early.
I'm a loyal customer and being pregnant I was really craving a salad.
I'll think twice before returning to this location.

Can't say enough good things about this location.
I used to meet at another local bakery, but the coffee there was terrible and the lighting not so good.
At Wildflower there is a quality menu and bright atmosphere which make this my go to spot for breakfast and lunch meetings.
Thanks Wildflower!
Check out:  the coffee - great!
Black berry lemonade - Awesome!
cranberry scone Emerald Spinach salad - I add mushrooms.
Vegetarian Spicy Red Pepper soup - excellent!!!
Seasonal quality baked items makes every new visit interesting:)

You get what you paid for, very nice quality.
The ambiance of the store is great as well.
Perfect for professional meetings, dates, or bringing your parents to.

Thought I would have got more food for my money...and it's cold!
A 10minute drive home and my food is cold?
And it's also under cooked I've never been here and so far I'm not satisfied....

Really good soups.
Great place to get caught up on work and grab a bit e at the same time

While visiting last March we tried this place and liked it enough to search it out again and were not disappointed.
We like the atmosphere and find it friendly and the staff kept the tables clean.
The food is tasty and of good quantity however the newly featured sandwich that was promoted was sold out so minus one star.
My wife tried a paste dish and found it tasty while I tired a grilled turkey pastrami.
My sandwich tasted very good but I struggled with the contents falling out including the honey mustard which left a stick mess.
Next time we are in this area we will return.

I'm never disappointed when I eat at a Wildflower.
It's a better version of Paradise Bakery with a feel free to stay all day if you like (but less pretentious) Starbucks vibe.
I also dig that one of the founders of the company emailed me to address some of my critiques of another location, even though the review was generally positive.
It's great to see that they're paying attention to their customers.
There's a great selection of sandwiches, salads and baked goods.
For the sandwiches I think the secret is in the simplicity and quality.
Most of them don't have more than three or four ingredients, but they seem to put together the perfect combination between those two slices of fresh baked bread.
My wife's caesar salad may have been one of the tastiest caesar salads I've ever tried.
This location also has a few cool things going for it.
There are power outlets under many of the booths, making it convenient for computer and tablet users to do whatever they are doing as they enjoy their drinks and meals.
Like other locations, there's the standard lounge near the front of the restaurant that's a perfect place for waiting for take out orders, or for coffee drinkers to hang out in a more open setting.
And this Wildflower also has a private party room in the back, which is also nice if you have a big group.
If you're anywhere nearby, Wildflower Bread Company is certainly worth a try.

Came here with the family after a trip to the RR museum across the street.
Orders were accurate and everybody seemed to be happy with their food.
I enjoyed  my open faced chicken parm, but it could've done better with a little less kale.
Also, they don't start serving pasta until 3 PM.
As a archetypal Joe Pesci-type character might say: "What the fuck is that shit?

I really liked the salad menu selections.
I picked out the Emerald Spinach Salad based on how good it looked when it was being served to another customer.
I believe it is a fantastic way pick out lunch.
Very nice combo of spinach, Gorgonzola, strawberries, pecans and grapes.
I was pleasantly surprised.
I will be back.

One of our favorite places to eat.
Their breakfast is delicious, from the eggs (over-medium, and correctly cooked), to the toast and the home fries ( with just the right amount of rosemary).
The breads and pastries are some of the best in the valley and  the staff are always friendly, helpful, and very accommodating.
Treat yourself and stop in for a meal.
You'll be glad you did.

I got surprised by this place.
Stopped in for something and ended up with the world's most non-conventional chopped salad.
Not what I expected or like any other chopped salad.
However, it was so good I enjoyed it without the dressing.
And I'd go back for seconds tomorrow if I was in town.
A bit spendy, bit worth every penny.

I Ordered the sweet potato sandwich and liked it a lot.
I'm not sure if it was the sweet potato itself or the fig sauce that tasted so sweet (actually a little to sweet for my preference) but the sandwich had a great flavor & was a reasonably hEalthy option.
I loved that this sandwich was very fresh tasting and made with good quality ingredients.
It was also large enough that I didn't need to order anything else so I saved my chocolate chip scone for later.
I Will be going back!

This place needs to step up the service...twice this week I had poor service.
Breakfast sales create themselves, it's up to the establishment to keep people happy with their choice.
You can find me at the small business (it's a closer drive anyway) coffee and bagel shop for the rest of the summer.
I'm not sure when I bother coming back if ever.
It's way too bad because they have some of the best bagels
