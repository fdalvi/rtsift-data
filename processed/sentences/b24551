It's a little hard to tell from the outside what exactly this store does, but this is one time where the name really does tell the story.
They sell flags, some sporting memorabilia as well as a few other odd touristy-type items.
The bright colors of the flags attracted my attention (does that mean I'm a bird?
) and then I started browsing.
The selection is a bit odd; the flags are from seemingly random countries and the sporting souvenirs are an odd mix.
It seems that they must stock a few popular teams items (think Texas, USC, Ohio State), a few local teams (i.e.
Arizona and ASU) and teams that have recently been in the Fiesta Bowl.
Not really too much that I would take home from here, but the prices are right and it probably isn't a bad place to search for that "I Saw Arizona" souvenir mug.
(Or leftover discount TCU merchanise from the Fiesta Bowl......)

The ownership is super friendly there and they have great prices on all their stuff!
I have been very impressed with their inventory and the store layout.
I would highly recommend them.
They have also been in the community for a long time, so it always helps to support a hometown small business owner that has to compete with national franchises and fortune 500 companies---Jeff S.

They've always got what I want.
I travel a lot and it's my goofy custom to hang the flag of whatever country I've visited for a while.
Like somebody else said, the guy who's usually in there when I've gone is really helpful and nice.
It'd get five stars except that they wait until it's pretty hot to turn the air conditioning on, and it's been pretty warm in there a couple times haha!
But really, I'd give Flag World & Sports 5.75 stars if that were an option.
