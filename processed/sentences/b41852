Firehouse is  #1 of the sub shops in our area.
Not the cheapest and not the most expensive but better quality than the cheapest and a better menu selection than all of them!
They will even accommodate a custom sandwich, in case, like me you still want something other than a menu item.
They have salads, a low calorie menu and  many hot & cold subs.
In addition the fresh bread, service and fancy Coke machine are top notch!
Check 'em out.

Amazing subs great atmosphere all while watchin the ball game.

We just moved to this community and tried it on our house hunting trip and again after moving here...Great price and very friendly staff!
Food is excellent with lots of meat and perfect amount of veggies and sauce!
It will be a regular for us

Friendly staff, clean, kool concept.
Staff did not know the menu.
I ordered my sandwich based on the counter guys description-- turned out to be totally different.
They gave my kid the wrong sandwich which we realized after we got home.
I will try it again though after they have been around and hopefully train their employees on the menu.
