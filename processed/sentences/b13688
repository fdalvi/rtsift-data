Although the front receptionist was sweet, the rest of the staff left everything to be desired.
The hygienist was staring at me the whole time I was filling out my paperwork.
The tech that took my xrays literally mumbled at me through the entire process.
The dentist was abrasive, curt, and ROUGH.
The last thing I am is sensitive to pain... this dude had me jumping out of my seat.
He poked my gums so hard I am still sore 3 hours later.
I have never had an experience like this in all my years.
I left there feeling like they must not want me to return.
So..
I won't.
Anybody know a good dentist????

My family and I have been going to Dr. Lee's office for almost 3 1/2 years now and they are the nicest people.
They always greet me with a smile, are punctual with my appointments and are very very good about offering me all options when I have dental issues.
I would recommend them to anyone looking for a happy, professional, stress free dental experience.

I haven't had this great of an experience at the dentist in years!
Dr Lee made my procedure painless and really tried to work with me and my budget.
Not only is he a great dentist, but his office is in a great location, right off US60.
I HIGHLY recommend!

I have been seeing Dr. Mike Lee for a few years now.
He is very friendly and highly skilled.
He has up to date instruments and is very quick but thorough.
It took him 10 minutes to clean my teeth with his machine.
His dental hygienist was definitely experienced.
I am tired of being poked and prodded by instruments or nearly choking on things that should not be set in my mouth as storage.
That has not happened to me with Dr. Mike.
His wife also works at this same practice.
