Located on the Royal Mile, O'Briens is usually my lunch joint of choice if I can't be bothered walking further afield.
Pretty much every eatery on the Royal Mile is expensive and O'Briens is no exception, but that's not due to it's location... O'Briens just happens to be pretty expensive, on average Â£4 for a sandwich which I think is pretty steep.
I really can't complain though as they taste so good with the freshest ingredients and an excellent choice.
I always got for the chicken and bacon TRIPLEDECKER... it's awesome and it's so big I always feel like a giant when I'm eating one.
If you choose to sit in with your order you get a little side of salad and hand cooked crisps but you can also takeaway and in addition to sarnies, toasties, wraps and sweet treats are also on offer.

I think it's fairly safe to say that the vultures are circling round the O'Brien's chain as a whole, with many of their stores disappearing, and this large one on High Street, surely as close to a flagship outlet as they'll get, worryingly empty even at 1pm on a weekday.
High prices, limited choice, lack of offers or advertising presence, the list of failings stretches as long as my arm, but as Eleanor says they're chicken and bacon number is pretty mouthwatering.
Try it before the bailiffs arrive.
