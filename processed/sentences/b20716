We use Oscars for lunch when we want to celebrate something at work.
We work at Chesser and coming up to Slateford Road is worth the trip.
The decor is imaginative and not what you'd expect at this end of town.
The menu is very modern and between us we've had everything on it.
The food is good and inexpensive.
Service has always been first class.
I'm sorry to say that it's never busy at lunchtime.
I hope it goes from strength to strength because it really is good.

Not what you'd expect to see in Shandon but a very nice bar nonetheless.
Prices are a bit steep considering your not in town but a nice selection of lagers and beers is a refreshing change from what's usually on tap in nearby pubs.
Nice place to start a night out.

This place sticks out like a sore thumb and for all the right reasons, Oscar's bar and Grill offers all the glamour of central Edinburgh restaurant's but in a suburban location.
The decor is great and looks really trendy and modern, there are booths available for larger groups to assemble around a table.
The smaller tables for groups of about 4 are good as well with soft seats and an ample amount of room that allows you to feel comfortable in the environment.
The food prices are very reasonable and you can get a two course lunch for around £9 and a three course lunch for £11.
The portions you get are very fair for the price you pay, will be returning pretty soon!
