We learned of Ortiz Brothers outdoor furniture from an ad they posted on Craigslist.
The prices and photos looked good so we thought we would check it out.
What we found was an impressive selection of sturdy and attractive chaise lounges and outdoor chairs, love seats and tables.
Every bit of the furniture is made on-site, from the wrought iron frames to the all-weather cushions.
The employees were friendly and helpful -- they allowed to us to pick the cushions and granite table top we wanted for our furniture set and delivered the furniture to our home for free.
The furniture is high quality, and while it's not cheap, it is definitely cheaper than most you'll find at the big patio furniture stores.

Great quality furniture and low prices.
Recommended from a friend - they didn't disappoint.
Our backyard furniture is great quality and looks fantastic!

Definitely worth the money.
First let me say (in my opinion) the price range rating of two $$'s should at least be three ($$$).
But don't misunderstand; this is not your cheap box store furniture.
The products the Ortiz brothers craft will last for many, many years.
If you're looking for run-of-the-mill factory furniture, you're looking in the wrong place.
Unique Patio Creations custom manufactures furniture that is durable and of high-quality.
In addition to manufacturing the metal portion of the furniture, they also manufacture the pads.
Manufacturing their own pads, allow you to choose the color of material for surface, sides, and pillows.
We ran across Javier Ortiz at the Tucson Home Show in Jan '13.
He is very polite and informative, but not the least bit pushy - it was a pleasure talking with him.
We had been looking for a two-person chaise lounge for a long time, but what we found was either low-quality or not what we wanted.
With Unique Patio Creations, we had the option of a single pad and single backrest, single pad and split backrest, split pad and single backrest... Well, you get the idea.
You have so many options and they are willing to make the furniture to your specifications.
If you get made-to-order furniture (i.e.
not what is at the showroom), it will take 4-6 weeks, so be patient.
However, it is well worth the wait.
And customer service - they are top-notch.
I live 180 miles from the shop and they provided free delivery and set-up.
Most other stores, I would have had to drive the distance myself or pay extra for delivery.
I can't say enough good things about Unique Patio Creations.
I definitely recommend them and will make another purchase from them.
(I have not received a "freebie" from (other than free delivery) nor am I connected to this business)

I had a very upsetting experience with Tony there.
I negotiated with him for an iron table with a glass top and showed a high level of interest.
He agreed on his price he suddenly said that I would have to buy the glass separately.
This is crazy - why would somebody buy the glass separately if that is what the surface is already made out of.
Shady approach to doing business and poor customer service.
Getting nicer quality and better customer service at AZ Iron Furniture.

Awesome customer service and furniture!!
High quality with sunbrella fabric that's perfect for the AZ sun!!
Great selection to pick from as well :)
