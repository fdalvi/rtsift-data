This is a fine example of a friendly local.
Located in the highly residential area of Polwarth, the pub offers a great menu and a large selection of drinks to choose from.
The pub has a great selection of snacks and hot food available and at great prices, I got a hamburger here and it only cost £2.50!
There are also toasties, paninis, baked potatos and salads.
My only criticism is that they stop serving food pretty early at about 5pm on the weekend, but the quality of the food is actually really good for the price.
The pub also have a good selection of hot drinks such as teas, coffees and hot chocolates, all for under £2 and they offer a takeaway service as well.
The pub also make a real effort in terms of entertainment as well, they have a pool table which is a good tool to while away the hours, but they also do special nights such as poker on Tuesdays and Pub quiz on Thursdays.
Will definitely be coming back pretty soon!

Want a pint and to watch a game of football in peace?
This is your place, no frills, no issues, a friendly bar staff with reasonably priced pints!!

Best avoided later at night as it seems to get a little crazy.
