Not at all reliable.
Makes appointments and does not show up.
Installed shutters on a door and the frame was too small to allow the door knob to operate.
Promised to come back and did not show or call.
Then Jim is angry because you called him too many times (even though he does not answer his phone).

If I could Rate a 0 or lower I would.. My wife and I needed some cabinet doors replaced,  After 3 times of trying to set up an appointment with ED he finally showed up took measurements and took one of my doors to match design and color.
He told me 1.5 weeks and we would have new doors.
After weeks of texting and calling him (which he never responds until you blow up his phone.
I always called him for an update he never called me.
He gave every excuse under the sun even going as far as using one of his employees that got in an accident.
I gave him an ultimatum to give me my door back or I will file theft charges against him.
Spoke to the police this morning, they are willing to help me recover my property.
Ed felt as though I was harassing him by calling and trying to get my property back.
Please do not give them any money or any of your property, you will not get it back.
Thieves and con artists save your money!!!
Still don't have my property back as of today 6/23/14
