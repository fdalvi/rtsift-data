Can you beat a $2 buck car wash?
So you have to do it yourself, c'mon Man, get sudsy and do your own car (shout out to all your high rollers who pay Danny's for their luxury wash)!
Weiss Guys on 40th Street is a T-bird secret.
Tucked away next to Circle K, it offers self serve and a drive through wash.
Always clean and neat, well-stocked, and with very friendly service.
If you pay for the drive-thru, make sure to give the guys a couple bucks for their hard work.
They do a great job drying your car off and deserve the cash.

Even a gun dryer, perfect for motorcycles!

I wrote a big scathing story, but decided just to put it simply.
Their water is cold.
Go somewhere else if you need/want warm water to rinse your car or undercarriage.

I went here for the Dog Wash.
IT is very nice and works great.
It did not take long to get my dog cleaned.
You do not need shampoo.
Here is what is included:  Tearless Shampoo Oatmeal Shampoo Vet Grade Shampoo Conditioner Warm Water Rinse Tub Disinfectant De Skunk Deodorizer Blow Dryer  I highly recommend it and will be back.
