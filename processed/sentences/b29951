I used to be a fan but their new hours prevent me from using them.
Additionally, they've been shrinking my clothes and when I pay them for repairs they don't get done at all let alone properly.
Suffice to say, I'm searching for a new dry cleaner close to my home.

We've used them a few times for alterations, which have been very slow (as in, promised by a certain time and a week later still not done).
They have a sign up which says they clean leather, but when I asked about it, they told me they send it to another place locally, so it would be cheaper to go there directly.
I went, and it wasn't.
So maybe just use them for men's shirts, because they have a great price on those, and leave the finer pieces to another shop.

Dropped off laundry and dry cleaning:  25-30 pieces.
Had a great front desk service when I was there during the week; picked up my clothes on a Saturday and was met by the most unfriendly woman I have met in the service industry in some time.
No "hello"  No "thanks for spending 125.00"...just a mean glare when I asked that she help me count the pieces to be certain it was all there...I asked if she was the owner and she said "nope" to which I replied "good thing since you are very unfriendly"....she could have cared less...my money will go elsewhere which is terrible since I live so close...their loss.

I wish I could give zero stars.
I live nearby so I was hoping I could use this dry cleaner.
I went in yesterday with a few clothing items.
Problems: 1) They didn't have their prices listed anywhere in the store 2) The woman behind the counter was rude when I asked her how much it would be to dry clean my clothing items.
I found it strange that when I asked her the price to dry clean she didn't know and had to punch a bunch of numbers on a calculator to finally tell me that my suit pants would cost $6+, the skirt would be $6+ and the jacket would be $7+.
I couldn't believe it.
No thanks.
I will be driving two miles out of my way to go to the cleaners futher north on 7th Ave that charge less than $2 per item.
I can't believe people patronize this business.
Anyone who pays $7+ to get a suit jacket dry-cleaned must be a millionaire with money to burn or a moron.
Don't be a moron.
