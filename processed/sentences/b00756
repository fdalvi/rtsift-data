I love this place!
I always get a good prescription, and they have really great frames!
I always enjoy getting fitted for frames by Corina who is a lovely person.
She gives great advice that you can trust if you are choosing between a few pairs.
I always recommend Optical Expressions to my friends.
Their frames and selection are great, and I always find something that's perfect for me here.
People often compliment my glasses.

I highly totally recommend this place.
The doc, a tall short hair gentleman, was professional and courteous.
You could tell this was not his first rodeo, he knew what he was doing.
The staff was nice and was able to get me in within a few days.
I was in and out in less than 45 minutes.
The Dr I saw told me "if you were my brother, I'd tell you that you don't need glasses, don't waste your money!
" I was shocked.
I was told 10 years ago that I do need glasses and had purchased a pair.
This guy could have totally lied to me and taken my money, my insurance would have even paid for it, and he didn't!
Hard to find honest people these days.
I'll definitely be back if I ever need anything with my eyes again.
I couldn't be happier with this place.
It's easy for a Dr in this field to make their money off people, telling them they "need" glasses etc.
I don't know anything about eyes or prescription glasses.

These guys are beyond awesome.
I was in Scottsdale/Phoenix from Mpls for the Rock and Roll 1/2.
I ripped my contact and had no spare lenses.
Upon contacting Optical Expressions they said to just fax my scrip and theyd help.
Help they did and at NO COST.
Plus they validated my parking.
Service like this is sometimes lost in the 21 century, but not at Optical Expressions.
Thank you.
