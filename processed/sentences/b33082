Ling was referred to me by a friend and she is absolutely fantastic.
Ling's eye for fashion-forward trends and brilliant use of color leaves little for any skeptic to criticize.
The salon is conveniently located, clean, and Ling offers a healthy variety of services.
She is competitively priced and only uses the best of the best in professional products.
To top it off, Ling's witty, fresh, professional personality make your time there a delight.
I highly recommend her.
