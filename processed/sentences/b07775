Well from the outside there wasn't much to this place and it was in a ok neighborhood.
However upon entering my hotel room I was very impressed.
It had been redone and looked chic and plush.
Large shower, huge rooms, and comfortable beds.
The two bad things where that the restaurant that was down stairs was close and I had planned on eating there and my bathroom door wouldn't close completely.
Other then that it was a really nice hotel at a good rate and I would stay there again!

As others have said, from the outside you wonder where you have decided to stay.
But once inside your room you are pleasantly surprised to see how nice the rooms are.
In the morning I was rushed, and disappointed that the breakfast was available at 630 as it was supposed to be.

The ramada inn is now the holiday inn.
It is has been renovated and updated!
The prices are great tons of accommodations like free gym for all guest which I thought was really cool.
Easy access to the freeway and shopping centers.
And the staff was very nice.
They also have a great Indian restraint inside.
