Love Chazen.
Thanks for bringing the bit of art culture to Madison.
The temporary exhibits are often interesting (although i can't quite say always great).
The permanent collections have some interesting stuff.
I'm not so fond of the modern art section, though.
Well, keep it up.
I'm looking forward to the large expansion remodel.

Just got a family membership with 50% discount through Goupon.
Deal!

Another free place to hang out in Madison?
This city is awesome!
With two buildings full of some interesting pieces, it's an easy way to spend a morning.
Just maybe keep away from noisy teens.

The best art collection in the state.
Surprisingly robust for the university level.

This sterling little art museum is quite big for a college art museum.
The building itself is aesthetically interesting and architecturally attractive.
The collection is remarkably varied, balanced, and inclusive.
I recommend a visit for absolutely any visitor to Madison, but it's an especially good place to teach older children about art, and how to behave in public.
Although there's no admission charge, it seems wrong to enjoy this gem without making some sort of donation, so I always do.
If you're coming to Madison for the MMoCA, allow an extra hour or two to add the Chazen.
If you're coming to campus for any reason, add a visit here.
Like at a lot of art museums, many of the guards are pleasantly over-qualified and quite informative.

Great deal (it's free!
) and quite the collection.
Loved spending my lazy afternoons here as a student and young professional.

This was one of our favorite stops during a two day stay in Madison.
Beautiful architecture and impressive collection of works for a campus museum.
Definitely worth a visit, especially knowing that admission is free!
