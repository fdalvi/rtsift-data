Nothing much has changed here.
I needed a specific product and tried to call the store, no answer.
As it was just after 5 PM on a Saturday, this was possible, but they are close-by and I took a chance.
When I got there I found the store open, empty except for the salesgirl, who was staring out the front window while the phone rang off the hook.
When I asked why she didn't answer the phone she got snotty.
Then when I asked for the product she said "This store doesn't carry that stuff".
I left with no purchase and a vow I will not return here!

I don't know why this store has such terrible reviews, I went in there and the two people the store knew their stuff and were extremely helpful!
They greeted me when I came in the door and answered every question I had!
Definitely will be coming back here :)
