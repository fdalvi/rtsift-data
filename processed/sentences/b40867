Are your seat belts buckled?
Here is an EXCITING gas station review!
WEEEEE!
(Hey when your on a road trip and you have a chance for an FTR, you go for it, right?
)  Time to head home from Phoenix and I remembered seeing this Arco with this price, the lowest I saw while in town!

And yes, it does say $2.99.9, but in reality it is $3.
Get with it people!
Clean mini-mart inside and the guy behind the counter smiled when I gave him my $$$ AND when I got my change!
Hey cheap gas is cheap gas!
WOO HOO!

Tried getting gas here by using my debit card, since they only take debit or cash.
Then they want me to pay an extra $0.35 process fee for using my debit card.
Not sure how that work and I will not ever get anything from here again.

Cheap gas but different prices if you are using card, outside have a lot of trash, used to be clean but not so much anymore, staff are pretty friendly.
Great price if you are paying cash.
