most honest and amazing guys ever!
great attention to detail and they are very smart!
you can count on good solid honest car repair.

Honest and reliable!
We have used them three times and Luis is very kind, honest, and not very expensive.

Do NOT go here.
I took my vehicle to have the transmission rebuilt by this shop due to a noise that sounded much like a card in the spokes of a bicycle.
It was rebuilt for the cost of $1500 and I was given a 12 month 12,000 mi warranty.
Within this warranty period I returned to the shop due to the same noise occurring.
I was told there was nothing wrong with the transmission and that if it went out it would be fixed free of Charge because they were confident it had no problem.
Now I believe they were just buying time until the warranty expired because after the warranty expired overdrive went out in the car.
This was worse than when I had first taken the car to be repaired (at time of initial repair transmission Functioned fine just made noise).
I took car to another shop after this one refused to fix it for free or for a reduced cost.
The second shop said a bearing had gone out likely because it was packed too tight by this shop (2b transmission).
2b did a poor job rebuilding the transmission if they even rebuilt it.
They then turned me away when I returned within the warranty period with the same problem causing the transmission to fail.
They even refused to answer my lawyer.
Unprofessional and unreliable.
