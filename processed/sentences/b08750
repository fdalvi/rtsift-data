My husband purchased my engagement ring for this Jared location.
Jenny was incredibly helpful during the diamond selection process.
I wanted an Asscher cut stone that wasn't readily avail.
They we gracious enough to have the diamonds specially requested for him to come in and choose from.
They kept in good contact with him during the engagement buying process.
We also purchased our bridal party gifts from this location.
Chris was awesome when we were going about and selecting timepieces for our groomsmen.
We had to order from a few different channels to get the quantity we needed, but he was on it for us.
Overall, this a great location to shop at for your bridal jewelry needs.
We did go to another location in the valley and were less than impressed.
We definitely recommend this specific location in the Scottsdale Renaissance Shopping Center.
