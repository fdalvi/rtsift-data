IDK why more people don't shop at this location.
I found better deals here than I do at local outlets.
I had to abruptly leave the store before stocking up on some awesome styles that were less than $40.
If I'm not careful, I might just spend an hour here and buy something for every outfit.
This store is definitely overlooked, and it's my new go-to spot for casual/athletic shoes.

Good deal the and employees are nice and will help you until you find what you wanted, it's located at park west and it a nice place to hang out, but not a lot of people come to this store.
Wish they are more closer to home.

Walked in with the intention of buying a pair of comfortable walking shoes for our vacation to Mexico.
The staff greeted us as soon as we walked into the store, and asked if we needed help with anything.
I started browsing at the clothing, since almost everything is on sale right now.
Yes, I LOVE sales so I went pretty crazy.
My husband meanwhile was looking at shoes and found a pair that was also water resistant perfect for the beach.
We didn't even know they made these the staff helped us by asking what they were for giving him more options.
He finally picked two pairs of which only one was available in his size.
One of the other girls at the store went into their backstock, just to make sure the other girl didn't miss them.
That just showed that they really do care about their customers.
This location has great customer service and like I said before many items are on sale.
Will definitely be coming back when purchasing another pair of shoes.
