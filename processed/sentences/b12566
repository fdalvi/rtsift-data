Overpriced and boring burgers.
In-n-out tastes twice as good for less.
I dare you to taste their pizza, terrible.
The fries are okay but you can keep driving past this one.

Yowga-ga-boing!
Excellent variety of signature burger combinations.
In particular, the one I tried (Desert Heat) was a taste sensation.
You don't find too many places offering both Angus and Kobe.
The buns were higher quality than your average burger stand fare.
The produce was nice and fresh.
Crisp lettuce, and the tomato was deep red, not that wilted yellow disc you sometimes get with the other guys.
Their beer battered onion-rings were perfectly crunchy and great tasting.
The fries tasted great, although they could have been a little more crisp.
Great selection of sodas (including Jones brand), energy drinks, and a unique variety of beers & wine coolers/malt beverages.
Trendy and clean upbeat environment.
Friendly staff.
The hostess was a cutie.
The grill guys paid attention to our order (I actually received a medium-rare patty).
The manager even came out and greeted us.
Maybe I was there on a good night, but you can bet I'll be back soon to try that seared Ahi burger.
In-n-out is good, but not even close to this good.

I LOVE burgers and was floored to stumble across this restaurant ... place looks really cool but what a huge disappointment!!
The burger was dry and tasteless and none of the staff seemed to care ... not even a hello!

As of 7/23/08 this location is closed.
It is being turned into a new business, a Korean fusion style restaurant.
According to the new owner, the business shut down about 6 months ago.

We drove here because of the reviews, but it doesn't exist!
The sign by the street says it's there, but you can't find it in the shopping/restaurant area.
Wish I could rate it, but the building is completely empty even though there are other places to eat in this one area.
You have been forewarned.
