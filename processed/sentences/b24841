Not my favorite Cycle Gear store - the selection is not as great as the one on the Cave Creek but ultimately they had what I was looking for - so who am I to complain?

I am a new rider and this shop helped me get geared up and I have been back four times and I have yet to find anything negative with the shop.

Visited the store to introduce someone to the store because he just moved to the state and rides a motorcycle.
About a year, year and a half ago, I had purchased a SEDICI motorcycle jacket from the Cave Creek location.
Unfortunately, the zipper broke on that jacket about four months ago, so I had a useless jacket just collecting dust in my closet.
When I mentioned this to John, the manager at this location (at first, I had no idea he was the manager), he pointed out the fact I could exchange the jacket.
I went home, picked up my jacket, and returned to the store.
I left with a brand new jacket and no money out of pocket!
I did, however, purchase a few other items because of the tremendous amount of money John saved me.
John and I spoke about many different products and he is knowledgeable in every aspect!
He did act like he was in a hurry or just wanted me to purchase something.
I hadn't shopped at Cycle Gear in quite some time because of unsatisfactory service at another location, but John made me a customer, a very happy customer, once again.
Thank you, John, for caring about your fellow riders!
You ROCK!
