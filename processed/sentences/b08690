Also located in the Scottsdale rare book district, next to the Antiquarian Shop and about a block from Charles Parkhurst Rare Books.
Compared to the other two shops, this one seems more focused on the west, exploration, science, religion and philosophy.
The stock also seems more obviously the sum of individuals' previous collections, so if you and one of those former collectors have common interests, you're in luck.
Most of the books are also for sale online, but lower priced items are often not.
It might be possible to find a good deal if you look reasonably hard.

The place looks and smells exactly how you would imagine a rare books store would.
Every one of my interests has been satisfied by the bounteous selection and the owner is very adept at finding the rare book that you are searching for.
Screw the Kindle, I'm old school like that.

Went in for the first time hoping to find something cool.
It was also the last time I will be there.
I was browsing the store and was offered help from the woman who worked there.
She was very nice.
While I was browsing I noticed that the woman and man (owner I think) that worked there were rearranging or stocking their shelves.
Suddenly the man came over and told me that they weren't a browsing bookstore and that I should leave.
Well I did.
How they expect to sell anything if you can't look at what they have, I don't know.
I won't be going back, that's for sure.
