Always super fast service.
Good food and some funny posters and sayings around the restaurant.
I wouldn't mind a little more meat on the sandwich and that's why I only gave 4 stars.

Great.
Fast and nice.
Little pricy but good food

The service is good, which is why it deserves 2 stars, but as far as food and subs go, you're going to want to go somewhere else.
I've been here twice and both subs were abysmal.
I can't remember exactly what it was but it was a thin with roast beef.
Basically $4 for some dense chewy bread with 1 slice of meat.
It would have been $5 with 1 slice of cheese.
The second time i ordered a different sub but it was still small and tasteless.
Besides service, the only other nice thing about here is that their ingredients are always fresh and they bake their own bread ( I mean the bread sucks but at least it's baked in store).
