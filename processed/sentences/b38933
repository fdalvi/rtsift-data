This location just opened.
May 24th 2013 was there first day of business.
I hadn't eaten at a Schlotzsky's for many years, so being as I work in the area I was looking forward  to having somewhere new to have lunch at.
I've eaten there twice now since they opened.
On both visits they were fast and very friendly.
Being they're brand new  you really wouldn't expect less than stellar service.
The food was good and a real change of pace to what has been available around here.

I dunno why this is listed as a pizza place, I believe Scholtzky's is known more for their sandwiches.
They do sell flat bread pizzas though too, along with breakfast sandwiches and chips too.
I got their medium smoked turkey sandwich on sourdough bread and could hardly finish it; it was pretty big.
It was also a pretty good sandwich too.
I went at a random, unbusy time so my sandwich was freshly made pretty quickly.
Located in Excalibur's upstairs food court, it was nice to find something not dripping with grease like some of the other fast food places around.

Wasn't really impressed with what I ate..
I'd rather go to a Mexican place to get a quesadilla.
