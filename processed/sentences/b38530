This is my first time here and I am so impressed!
I was recommended by a friend to come here and I am so happy I listened to him!
Thanks Roger!
First off, you can make an appointment, so you don't have to wait forever and waste your whole day.
Second, the place is surrounded with places to eat at while the work on your car is being done.
Yummy.
Third, the waiting area is nice and clean.
I wasn't afraid to sit down on the chairs.
They also have a little area for kiddos to sit and play.
The toys were clean as well.
Fourth, the customer service guys are awesome!
They talk to you instead of down to you.
They didn't make me feel dumb at all, which is a nice change from most mechanic places.
Lastly, I felt valued.
Everyone was friendly.
I was thanked repeatedly.
I had a good experience all the way around.
I will be coming back here for sure for my car's needs, which hopefully isn't too often!

Great service.
Friendly staff.
Amazingly quick turnaround.
Clean shop and waiting area.
Open on Sunday - A huge plus in an emergency repair.

Great customer service and thorough in their work.
Only complaint is they are pricey but I have yet to see another shop match their cleanliness and service.
But still better and cheaper than a dealership as well.

Awesome, awesome service.
None of the people here displayed the usual negative stereotypes associated with auto repair sites.
They told me exactly what was wrong with no fluff and no "strong recommendations of other repairs", were very polite, and the overall cost was very reasonable.
I will be going here from now on as opposed to Big O!

Awesome place.
Great service.
Knowledgeable staff.
Extremely helpful.
Good prices.
We will definitely return.
My boyfriend and I have our own transport business and wound up stranded in Las Vegas due to a brake issue.
After doing a lot of traveling across the country, I have learned how difficult it is to find competent mechanics who can work on a Dodge dually properly.
I found these guys on Yelp and we showed up to their business unannounced within the last hour of service on a Friday night.
It wasn't a "cool" move, but we needed speedy service and this place had good reviews.
We showed up with our fingers crossed and ready to bail and wait until morning if necessary if we didn't think these guys were up to the task of fixing the dually properly - it's our livelihood.
Thank goodness we wound up here.
The guys stayed late to help us out, were honest with what needed to be done, helped us find the best price on parts, and even gave us a ride down to the strip so we wouldn't have to grab a cab.
They did everything in their power to get us up and going as soon as possible and made sure everything was fixed and ready to go before we headed back to Oregon.
The dually was ready ASAP.
This will be our new west coast location for repairs and I recommend the Rock Springs Firestone to anyone who needs car service or repair of any kind.
They're great guys who do good work in a timely manner.

I never write reviews but I had to in this case.
I have bought many tires in my life but this is by far the best experience I have ever had buying tires.
This shop is EXCELLENT.
I bought Bridgestone Potenza S-04 Pole Position tires for my 2012 Mustang GT.
They were not in stock so they found a set for me in Sante Fe.
They arrived a day earlier than promised and installed them the same day they came in.
They gave me discounts on the tires and lifetime alignment service without asking.
They found an annoying alignment problem I've had that other shops, including the Ford dealer could not figure out.
When the installation was done, the service advisor, Trevor, bought my paperwork outside to me as to not interrupt the cigar I was smoking while I waited.
I chose to keep my old tires because they still had a lot of tread and were resellable.
I planned on bagging them up and taking them home in my car but they INSISTED that they follow me home, 15 minutes away, in their shop truck with my old tires so I would not have to put them in my car.
This is the type of service that is above and beyond, a rare find these days.
If you need tires in Las Vegas this is the place to go!

Ive brought my car into Firestone a couple times and they are amazing!!!
They are by far the most honest mechanics I've ever met it's a true breath of fresh air to meet an auto place that isn't out to rip people off.
They've definitely gained a customer for life I won't go anywhere else now!

Great service.
They seem to take their time and cater to each customer.
Very happy with the service.

Five Stars for Trevor at Firestone!
This guy kicks ass.
I am a girl and he is so nice to explain car lingo to me every time.
He has gone out of his way for us when we've taken our cars in.
Great place.

I felt like I needed to write a great review for this location.
I have been to this location several times and have never been treated better with very fair prices and no added useless work shoved down my throat.
I have to say Trevor and Earl are very personable knowledgeable guys and very friendly.
I wish I could remember the AC guys name because he saved me $700.00 worth of work on my A/C!
I went to two different mechanic who both told me I needed a new air compressor in the neighborhood of $800-$1100 dollars worth of work I brought my car to them because I have a firestone card a blessing because interest free to pay off in six mo.
anyway they ran the test and it turns out it was a $60 dollar relay!
compressor was fine!
out the door 112.00 dollars tell me that isn't great, thanks to the A/C guy  and the guys at firestone

Trevor is the shit, great guy and a great shop.
Will be coming back for any automotive needs.
