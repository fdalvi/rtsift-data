I can not believe that there isn't a listing yet for this salon!
I was recommended by a friend to go there last year.
I am particularly in love with my aesthetician Alana.
She does my eyebrow waxing but also can do makeup.
I have been messed up plenty of times and she is right on everytime.
My eyebrows are the best that they have ever looked.
I always have the best service when I go there.
PLUS champagne... always makes the day better.
It is a beautiful, very clean salon.
You would think that it is stuffy but everyone seems to get along and have fun together.
You don't see that much in salons.
PLUS- for locals it isn't hard to get to.
You do not need to go through the casino at all.
They have a back entrance that they will direct you to and if you get lost, they will meet you outside.
From parking to the salon is not even 5 minutes.
I am telling locals(as well as tourists) that you need to try this place out.
You get top quality!

I would not recommend this salon to anyone.
My girlfriends and I got pedicures and no one was happy with the quality.
I had to ask the woman to do my nails twice and they still were not up to normal standards.
The women were talking to each other and not paying attention to what they were doing.
I also got lash extensions.
They looked amazing, however, they were supposed to last 2-3 days and only lasted for 12 hours.
If you have time to find a different salon, do it.

I went to Vegas for labor day weekend.
I found this salon in my hotel and tried it out.
Paul did my color and highlights, and I have never been so in love with my hair!!
He did such a great job.
My hair looks so natural, and the color is so beautiful.
On the other hand, Jean Luke (I think that was his name) did my blow out and style.
I told him what I wanted, and he disregarded what I said.
I walked out of there looking like someone from the 70's.
I had wings!!
Besides the hair style that I got, I LOVE my hair color and if you get a chance to try this salon....go to Paul!
He is the best!

My hair was a wreck.
I looked like a tortoiseshell calico cat, with three different colors of hair.
My hair was dry, split, and broken.
It was attracting hummiingbirds, who thought they might nest in it.
I did a bit of web research, and felt Christophe might have the kind of expert coloring and conditioning I was searching for.
The salon is beautiful, a bit hidden in the back of the huge MGM hotel complex, and it overlooks the elaborate pool area.
The stations are sleek and clean, modernistically streamlined.
Sunlight flooded the stations, and made for a pleasant ambience.
I made an appointment with Jean-Marc at Christophe, and had a brief consultation when I arrived.
My colorist Paul, also consulted in great detail, to be sure of the effect I wanted.
I had gathered several pictures, since color is extremely hard to describe save visually, and also had a style discussion.
I wanted a bit of a trendy retro look, a slight bouffant, and believable honey blond streaks.
Paul proceeded to do the most precise job of streaking my hair that I have ever have.
I have long, normally strong straight hair, and he patiently streaked my entire mane.
He also touched up the brass at the roots, and did a marvelous conditioner, that made my hitherto straw locks look like silk.
The L'Oreal hair products I got to continue the condition have helped my hair heal.
Then I had the pleasure of Jean Marc creating a personal style appropriate to my yen for glamour, and busy lifestyle.
He quickly and masterfully rendered a long Bardot-inspired cut, which took advantage of my slight natural wave, and created a casual, yet suave look.
At $150.00 for the cut, it is a bargain.
When I left the salon, I was walking on air, my newly blown-dry mane signaling the resurection of a devoted fashionista.
Merci mille fois to both Paul and Jean-Marc!

One of the nicest salons anywhere.
I was very impressed with all of the services we recieved.
Impeccable location.

I regularly get my hair colored and cut here.
It is the best salon I've been to in Las Vegas.
Everyone is incredibly nice and there is nothing stuck up about the place.
Of course the service they provide is awesome too.
Paul does my hair and Eric cuts it, always the best.
I've also gotten great manicures from a few of the girls there.
I highly recommend.

I went to this salon and had a great time!
The place is beautifully decorated and they played a lot of fun music.
The people are very friendly.
They gave me free champagne as I got my hair done.
Campbell did my hair and gave great advice as I was unsure what I wanted to do.
The haircut was better than i could have pictured it!
After my hair was done, Gina did my make-up.
She made me look like a completely different person!
I especially loved my eyes.
The way she made them stand out was so impressive.
I would recommend this salon to everyone.

I had a "hair emergency" and needed to get my extensions out right away and I was able to get in the same day.
Paul removed my extensions and gave my hair beautiful color and Stacy gave it a great cut.
I am very tempted to find my way back from the Bay Area every few months for touch ups - they took great care of my hair!!
Thanks guys & gals!

I visited the Cristophe Salon at the MGM Grand on my 30th birthday.
I made an appointment to get my hair blown out for the big night.
Campbell was my stylist and I have to say that I had the best hair of my life that night.
He styled me at 5:15PM and by the time I took pictures that night at 10:30PM, my hair was still perfect.
I really loved him because he knew how to style my Asian hair (and a lot of people don't).
The other great thing about Campbell is that it took him 15 minutes.
I love when people are great at their jobs.

So amazing!
I wish I could remember the names of the folks who did my hair,nails and make up for my wedding day.
I had so much fun during my appointments and absolutely loved the end result.
I can't say enough good things about this salon.

We were at MGM for a wedding.... a mixture of sweet and sad, as the Bride has cancer.
She booked the wedding package, and got hair, makeup, mani-pedi at Christophe.
Her hair is now a wig, and although well made, was not flattering.
Eric Bensimon took care of that.... he was kind, gentle, accomodating and incredibly talented.
He took her wig and made it magic.
From the moment we entered the salon everyone took care of the Bride.
The day was extra special because of these lovely people... every one of them.
Thank you!

I've been waiting so long for this.... finally I get to write a 5 star review for a salon in Vegas!
I left my wicked awesome stylist behind in Boston when I moved here in August.
Since then I've been to six stylists in about as many months here in Vegas, never seeing the same one twice.
I was really starting to think that Vegas salons just get beauty school dropouts and that I'd never find someone of the same caliber as the girl I saw in Boston.
Well, Paul Juma at Christophe rescued my hair and opinion of Vegas salons!
I came to him with a yellow and orange bleached out hay-like mess from Vdara, pining over a photo of what it used to look like in Boston.
I had in mind how I felt comfortable with it getting fixed.
(I'm no stylist but I've been getting my hair done the same way for so long that I know what works, and allowing someone at Vdara to do a process I wasn't comfortable with cost me any semblance of good hair and $360 on color alone.
) But I didn't mention to Paul during our consult anything other than "fix this.
" He described exactly what I was thinking!
Really dense foils, lots of dimension, some higher highlights to break up the yellow, some lowlights to blend my natural hair, and lighten my base.
It came out perfect!
He kept emphasizing that this is just the first step to repairing my color, and that as I keep it up it'll get better, but I'm already so happy with it!
I was definitely much more concerned with color when I went in.
I can hide a bad cut much better than I can hide bad color.
But now I don't have to hide bad anything!
I saw Stacy for a cut and she was great as well.
She did what I asked for, didn't do anything I didn't ask for, and was nice and down to earth to boot.
I'm so relieved to have found a regular salon!

CAMPBELL is the best hair stylist I have ever been to in my 35 years of existence.
I have very long hair, and I went to CAMPBELL to cut about 12 inches off.
( I never cut my hair) I was extremely nervous and didnt know what to expect.
CAMPBELL proved to be more than I ever expected.
He's pleasant, patient, humble, down to earth, he takes his time, listens to you, gives you great advice, isnt pushy, and isnt all bout money.
He's a nice person and I feel blessed to have had him work on my hair.
I left there feeling like a million bucks and wanting to do cart wheels* lol* I can honestly say, CAMPBELL is the only person I trust with my hair.
Everything I mentioned and more is what makes CAMPBELL the absolute BEST EVER.
I guarentee you, you will not be disappointed!
It was worth every penny & more.
p.s.
There are no hidden fees, what you are quoted for a hair cut is what you pay...I LOVED IT!

This place is first class!
After visiting several other hair salons around the valley, I have to give Cristophe 5 stars.
My colorist Paul took the time to listen to my concerns and desires.
And, then did a fabulous job.
My stylist Campbell also did a great job of determining what I was looking for.
This is the best haircut I've had in 2 years and after leaving my salon in Northern California...
I didn't think I'd find someplace as great.
I would highly recommend this salon to anyone looking for a professional salon that delivers what it promises.

I did my homework before choosing this salon.
It had gotten great reviews, and I can see why.
The two people who worked with me Stacey for hair and Caroline for make-up were not only great, but they made the experience so much fun.
They listened to what I wanted, and they made it happen.
The salon kept me relaxed with a stream of pineapple mimosas, which were a blessing to me on my wedding day.
The results were great, and I was very happy, even though (like most salons), I paid a pretty penny.
LOL But hey, it was my wedding day, so no matter.
I didn't get married there and went to get my hair done there, so that should say something ...

I really l like this salon.
I've been here three times and have always had a great blowout from Jean ___?
Forgot his middle name.
They talk to you first to get an idea what you want, give you an AWESOME massage/shampoo, and take their time styling you just right.
You'll be enjoying a glass of champagne all the while.
Prices are reasonable, as these things go on the Strip.
They don't try to oversell you on additional services or load you up on products.
Just a good blowout and a glass of wine.
My blowouts here have always lasted at least 48 hours, which is like 10 years in Vegas time, right?
Give them a try!

i would like to write something i have come to know       paul juma is a very special human being.
he is a very sincere and kind person as well   i think its fair to say   i know quite well.
he has so many wonderful traits   and even a hot temper..... which most will never see   because he has way too much class to lose his cool     by the way   i m debi  from huntigton beach,  ca.
only i could stir him up so,    and well deserved   and over.
what i am trying to say        is paul juma is one extraordinary  good natured   funny  very professional....descent human being        he did my hair once        ill spend the rest of my life begging him to do it again        girls  ladies who do get their hair done by him    know this part       he's a great stylist    too    you never have to go anywhere else        oh you lucky  girls      i went somewhere else      and my hair is destroyed     and paul is still helping me      treat him nice   he's one of a kind

This review is for Christophe's very talented makeup artist Spencer Lopez.
I followed her over from her previous salon and I will continue to follow her wherever she goes!
I have been seeing Spencer for over a year now for all of my Vegas makeup needs and I leave her chair a satisfied client each and every time.
If you want flawless makeup that photographs very well you have to see Spencer!
She uses products the pros use and has her technique down to a t!
For examples of her work you can check out Christophe Salon Las Vegas on Facebook and I have a picture on my Yelp page from a night that she did my makeup.
Prices are very reasonable for a hotel salon on the Strip and lower than what I expected for being a Christophe Salon.
Cost is $75 for a makeup application and $25 additional each for airbrush and for lashes.
The salon is located by the MGM pools and it's quite a long walk from the garage but so worth it for the end result!
I would make that long trek again to get all dolled up by Spencer :)  Update Jan. 2013: Spencer no longer works at the salon.

I highly recommend Cristophe's salon at the MGM.
The receptionist was so accommodating, very friendly, and made miracles happen.
The Cristophe's team is so talented, professional, fun and friendly.
They really make you feel like super star.... Eric Bensimon was my master stylist, he cut my extensions and stylist them.
It was an amazing  Paul Juma colored my blonde hair and gave me hairlocs extensions.
He's extremely talented, super fun, honest and makes you feel comfortable.
I will definitely being coming back  :) Thank you Cristophe's team

So I went here in DElC.
2012. mainly because I was getting a 50% discount thru work.
Just toI get a one color all over.
Somehow he was over booked and had 3 clients (including me) at once.
im not gonna lie I was very frustrated, I made an appointment so I would hope that I wouldn't be kept waiting longer then necessary.
He was a very friendly man.
But he missed half of my head of hair..
How?..
I figure if im going to a top quality salon it should be done correctly the first time.
Now .. sorry to jump around but when i first walked in i was offered - water,cranberry, or coffee.
I thought that was SO SO cool.
just hadnt had that experience before.
I had to come in again to have it done.
He was not overbooked, but seemed uninterested and distracted.
But he got the job done.

I had a shampoo blow dry with extensions done, and I felt that for $115 my hair would would look AMAZING.
The stylist was very nice, but all of my curls were flat and falling  out even by the end of the appointment.
There were many pieces of my hair that were completely straight and she also did not use any hair spray throughout the whole service.
By the time that I got back to my room, I had to have one of my girlfriends actually re-curl my hair for me.
Overall I felt that the stylist did not spend enough time with me to complete the service well, and I definitely would say that it was a huge waste of my time and money.

Campbell gave me the best haircut ever!
Worth every penny and he made it fun, thrilling and so easy!
I will try Cristophe in DC.
Kay did my make up and it was fabulous!
My husband told me that I looked 10 years younger.
I have been getting wonderful compliments!
Thanks to all who work there.
I refer to my time spent there as my Vegas treat!!
Thank you so much

I was in town for the very busy International Re/Max conference and needed to get a blow dry that would last.
When travelling, you usually wind up with second rate salons and stylists in hotels.
The Chrisophe Salon in the MGM is not only state of the art and a very clean and gleaming salon, the staff must be all hand picked.
Great personalities, no attitude and bending over backwards to assist.
My stylist Christie was great and gives a fabulous blow dry.
Considering it was the first day she worked on my hair which is long and straight and goes flat, she gave me a salon look style that was natural and 2 days later is still bouncing around like it was just done.
$85 for a blow dry and definitely worth it  Recommend Christie anytime  Wish she was in Toronto Dawna B

After I botched my own haircut, I figured it would be good to find some external help.
The salon is tucked away from the casino, located down a hallway past the front spa reception.
The salon is bright and gorgeously decorated.
My haircut was done by an assistant / stylist-in-training, so it was complimentary.
She did a nice cut, but was a little too careful so it took a long time.
The haircut was checked by one of the regular stylists, who pointed out a few things to make my hair a little better.
The end result looked great.
Nicely layered, and didn't give me "triangle hair" which I sometimes get due to my wavy thick hair.

*** WARNING **** DO NOT SEE KAT *******  If you go to this salon have the Master Stylist cut your precious locks.
After seeing a coworker arrive at work with her new STUNNING haircut I demanded the stylist's information.
I loved the cut, it was so flattering and gave my coworker a boost of self confidence.
Before the haircut I had hair past my shoulders in long layers.
I found a picture of a long layered bob that went two inches above my shoulders.
I showed her the picture and with my fingers showed her 3 times the length I wanted my hair.
She DID NOT call over the Master Stylist to conference with before she took her first cut.
She had me move my chin to my chest, measured with her finger then...... chopped!
Yes!
She chopped my hair to at the base of where my head and neck meet.
Once she made that fateful cut I went with it because how on Earth can you uncut 3 inches of hair.
I thought "ok, it will be a little shorter but I will still have the long layers like the picture".
Oh was I wrong.
I ended up with an asymmetrical bob!
That is the anti-haircut.
I would NEVER EVER EVER ask for an asymmetrical bob EVER!
That is not a flattering style for me.
I was horrified but heck.... you get what you pay for.
The master stylist should have looked at the picture before she cut it.
He did not even ask if I had a picture when he inspected the completed cut.
Every time I wash or style my hair I am crushed.
I now have a short flared at the sides Lisa Rinna hair cut and have to find a stylist to fix my hair on a regular basis to get the look I wanted in the first place.

I found an ad on Craigslist for a free haircut from a junior stylist named Ivy and went in on July 4th.
I am very pleased with the results.
I have long, red, curly hair and so most stylists don't know what to do with it.
Ivy understood exactly what I wanted and was not afraid to make that first cut (I'm telling you, a lot of people are afraid to cut red and/or curly hair.
Weirdos.
haha)  Anyway, my hair is long, so I always expect about 2 hours when I'm at the salon, and it ended up only taking about an hour and a half.
She washed my hair very thoroughly and I loved the scalp massage.
It had been over a year since my last cut, so my hair feels great now.
It has body, shine, and perfect layers again.
She didn't take off too much or too little.
She took great care with me, yet didn't go too slow.
(She even offered me a drink, which NO ONE ELSE DID.
I thought that was the receptionist's job, but maybe they thought I didn't deserve it because it was a free cut?
I mean, there were 2 front counter girls, and it was about 112° outside so I was thirsty and wanted water.
)  The supervisor walked by a couple times but did not give any pointers or advice, just kept nonchalantly saying, "beautiful, beautiful.
" Ivy was very thorough, so when he wouldn't actually stop and double check her work, she specifially went to him and told him he needed to check her work, which he finally did.
Even though she had been cutting hair for a few years, part of the free haircut deal is that they check the work just to make sure and make her the best stylist she can be.
I applaud her for going the extra mile with that.
I like having a second opinion when I'm at work, too.
You never know if someone else will catch something for you.
I also completed the survey afterward, which was part of the learning experience.
The only thing I can say negatively (and it's more neutral really) is that I think she blow dried it just a little too much in a couple little places, not a big deal so I didn't mention it to her.
And it was probably just because of the curl.
Great volume at the roots, though.
And I got lots of compliments anyway!
haha.
Outside the salon, towards the food court, there was a kiosk so I took a picture and posted it on Facebook so everyone could see my great new haircut!
If you go to Cristophe, be sure to take a picture afterward and spread the word.
(And to "Alisa" who complained about getting a terrible cut but then filled out the survey saying that everything was PERFECT: What probably happened is that you were totally pumped about your new hair, absolutely loved it, then when one rude person decided to tell you THEY didn't like it, you decided to change your whole tune.
I work in customer service, I see that everyday.
If you didn't like the cut, you should have said something during the whole process, don't just sit and wait for the end results.
Getting your hair cut is an interactive process.
If you didn't think she was doing it right, you should have ASKED for the master stylist and POINTED OUT the picture you were going by.
The squeaky wheel gets the grease, dear.

this is the rudest place that i've ever been to the service was horrible and they treat their customers like trash and this was at the mgm casino i would never recommend anyone to go to this place ever they don't listen to the customer and the girl was scared to cut my hair they don't listen to constructive criticism and all of the stylist there dont' know what they are doing this is the worst place ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I visited Kelly (color) and Campbell (cut) for the first time last weekend.
Kelly did an amazing job with lightening and brightening my color and Campbell chopped off over 6 inches of hair (at my request).
He did an amazing job!
I LOVE my new look and couldn't have asked for a better salon experience.
The compliments keep rolling in and I could not be happier with the more modern "me".
You two are rockstars.

I had excellent service here-- great cut and blow out.
I'm definitely not complaining about that.
I did notice though that the receptionists were very chatty and gossipy and it was annoying while you are waiting for your appointment.
If you're paying that kind of money it's nice if you can wait in a quiet area and not have to hear whispering and gossipping every second.

"BOOOOOOM BABY!
" has been my captioning on all of the social media sites in which I have uploaded photos of my new, luscious, and voluminous hair.
With my blazing red hair and a platinum blond peekaboo to satisfy my blonde-norexia, I have received compliments after compliments with my new hair.
I cannot be happier about it and I definitely feel like Rogue in X-Men so I am ready to kick some- just kidding.
I have had a long history with this salon and their wonderful employees.
I started seeing Kat back when she first began training.
My my has my baby came a long way!
I remember our first blowout together and since then, her confidence has shot up and her movements are much more fluid.
Now, she holds that hair dryer and brush with some sass and she is completely confident in what she is doing.
I dug through my archive and found photos of her blowouts that she used to do on me and uploaded them.
Call and book with her to receive your complimentary cut while she is still an assistant stylist and if you happen to be a repeat client for her.. let's just say you will find out the perks of that when she becomes a master stylist.
I love the cut and beautiful curls she gave me after I got my hair colored.
Now, Miss Kelly needs a paragraph all her own!
I took my friend, Molly Q., here in June 2013 and originally Molly wanted to do an allover red base and then a blond ombre (her hair was dark blond when we went in).
We were both so glad that Kelly talked her out of it because at the time, my friend's hair was short and we agreed, it would not have looked how she imagined it to be.
Now, Kelly's creation on her was AMAZING and it wowed both of us.
An allover red base with blond peekaboos starting from her bangs and cascaded down.
Ever since then, those coloring skills did not leave my mind because trust me, I was impressed.
I was finally able to book with her yesterday and she gave me this beautiful hair that I have uploaded for you all to see.
I originally had blond highlights allover and my black hair was definitely grown out.
I wanted to do an allover red base and two blond peekaboos on both sides of my face starting from the temple and then also on my bangs.
She told me that it was definitely doable, but showed me, on my hair, how the disconnect of blond would not flow well because I like to keep my bangs fairly short.
I agree!
So.. no blond on the side that I have bangs and instead of a blond peekaboo, she gave me a blond chunk that was not afraid to show itself and say "HI WORLD!
I'm not hiding!
" I love my hair and cannot give her enough thanks.
Definitely come in and see them!
:)  I have to take time and address some reviewers who felt like they need to post personal attacks.
First off, yes, there are some junior stylists at this salon.
In the beginning, they had to bring people/models in by word of mouth and however they could market themselves on social media sites.
The GM's kindness to posting on Craiglist (so her stylists could get more and more experience) definitely brought in some riffraff who want nothing other than to get a free service and then complain complain complain.
I have heard it all before.
The complimentary haircut done by an assistant stylist at this high-end salon is definitely a deal!
If someone is offering you a free service that not only includes wash and shampoo, then cut and blow dry then please have some self respect.
Yes, there is such a thing as constructive criticism but:  1.
Be responsible for showing on your ACTUAL head how much you want off.
If she is confident in the cut then WHY does she need to consult every single cut with a master stylist?
When I was in beauty school and doing services on clients, if my trainers were confident in me, they gave me free reign.
Which is what it sounds like to me.. they TRUST her judgment.
If you fill out a survey saying that you loved your service and walked out saying that you love your hair then don't flip flop.
I see that you only write negative reviews and those are my least favorite kind of reviewers.
TIPS:  - Park in front of the Grand Garden Arena in designated parking spots that say "FOR CHRISTOPHE SALON GUESTS" to avoid parking in the MGM parking structure and getting lost in the casino before you can even make it here.
If you need help getting there, just ask the friendly receptionists when you book.
- They sell Kerastase products here.
- They do take a CC down for booking and have a two hour change or cancellation policy, so please have some courtesy to call-in or you will be charged.

Five stars are for my hair stylist Brice Bensimon.
I haven't been yet at Cristope Salon, but i have seen Brice a couple of times and he is simply amazing.
All knowledgeable and very helpful.
He is a good listener, gives proper advise , and puts time end effort into making your hair great.
( he is also charming and fun to talk to) My hair never looked so good before!
I highly recommend him.

I am a Las Vegas local professional business man.. For 2 years I searched for a stylist and can honestly give a 5 star shout out to Brice in this salon.
Brice listens, is extremely talented and takes the time to do it right no matter how busy or behind the salon may be.
Male or Female, if you seek a one time or long term stylist look no further.
Ladies, he e is amazingly handsome (taken) and will enhance your beauty from the inside out.
I don't look forward to getting a haircut every three weeks but I do look forward to seeing Brice, a true and genuine man and a Vegas stand out!

Can I just say that Erik (or Eric) gave me a life-changing experience with my hair!
He cut my hair 12 inches into the perfect shape and style for my personality, look and vibe.
He is a true genius and my life quality has been better since I went to him.
You won't regret this decision!

Honestly one of the best salon experiences I've ever had.
For men's cuts definitely go for Bryce.
He's talented, pleasant, and easy to chat with.
Cut was great, nothing was a hassle, and the place is nice.
It's in the spa/salon area of the MGM Grand so it is a bit of a walk but totally worth it.

10 stars for Eric!
I have been getting my hair cut and blow outs from him for a few years now and I always walk away feeling like a super star.
I should have yelped him many moons ago and kept updating with the same five stars.
I don't indulge in a lot of things, but when it comes to my hair I am willing to take the 500 mile plunge for this amazing cut (luckily I make enough trips between work and fun that I get to see him just when my hair is in need!
)  For my birthday at the end of December, my hubby surprised me with a day trip to Vegas just to get my haircut!
Best present ever!
I got to walk in and tell Eric he was my birthday present = )  The husband actually calls and makes my appointments for me because he is scared that one day Eric will leave and I will try and make an appointment and be told the devastating news.
Eric takes great care to give me a haircut that will work for when I style my hair curly or straight.
He has excellent cutting technique and takes time to make everything perfect.
His blowouts are so amazing you will walk away wondering what just happened!
I was sitting at a slot machine feeling fantastic after my style and I got carded.
I wasn't drinking and I got carded for being old enough to gamble!
1) never happens in Vegas 2) I am in my thirties and have not been carded for gambling ever!
If I had to name the top three things to do in Vegas (and I come here a few times a year), getting a cut and blowout with Eric would definitely make the list!
Eric- thanks for keeping my hair amazing!

My wife and her bridesmaids got their hair done before our wedding, they all loved the experience!
Thank you!!!
Highly recommend.!

I was at the MGM Grand for a conference, and needed a haircut that night for a gala ... they were able to get me in and Carolyn did a FANTASTIC job cutting and styling mt hair... wish I lived closer to be able to go to her all the time!

Amazing service, great haircut, fabulous blowdry - HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

While staying at the MGM for a tradeshow, I decided to see if I could get a walk-in appointment, I needed several services, but the first on my list was my eyebrows.
Walking in to Christophe is a bit intimidating at first, because it is very chic and I was afraid I was going to be dealing with the kinda people that look down at you from the top of their noses.
That was not the case, as soon as I walked in, I was greeted with super warm smiles and a bottle of water!
They were able to get me in for an eyebrow wax and it was a Sunday!
I cannot remember who did my eyebrows, but she was great!
I was very impressed.
So impressed that I booked a manicure the next day, but while booking I saw this darling girl in the salon with the cutest haircut!
That was Carolyn, she was super sweet!
She tried to book me for a haircut and blow-dry, but she was booked, but set me up with somebody else who she felt would do a the same cut.
I plan to go back in this Thursday.
I came back today for my manicure, and met Marilyn, she did my nails, and again, so friendly and made me feel so comfortable!
Marilyn was very accommodating and made my poor stubby little nails look amazing!
I highly recommend this salon for services of any type!
Well done ladies!!!
I am excited to come back to get my hair done soon!

Love love this salon.. Juan did a wonderful amazing job with my cut...
I will definite book another appt when I'm back in Vegas!
Highly recommend!
My sister had Erik and he did a wonderful job as well!
Two thumbs up!

My now wife went to Christophe to get a mani, pedi, hair and makeup done for the wedding.
She wanted me along for the ride.
This place is a very inviting place.
It's not cozy or necessarily warm but it has the feel of being a place for pampering which is exactly what you're looking for.
We were greeted warmly and offered a beverage while we waited as we were 10 minutes early.
At every stage of the appointment, even as a tag-a-long, they made sure I was just as comfortable as my wife.
The hair and makeup were done superbly by their staff.
The mani/pedi were ok.
The nail polish was a little bit sloppy and could have been done with a little more precision.
Price for this was actually very reasonable.

Gentlemen!
Looking for a great stylist?
Brice Bensimon gave me an awesome hair cut.
He is an outstanding hair stylist.
#Highly recommend him.

Great salon!
I have been getting my haircuts with Juan for over a year now; he is the best hairstylist I have ever met.
Kelly is also an amazing colorist.
I highly recommend this salon.

Kelly is amazing with color and Bryce gave me a great cut.
They were quick, very nice, and I was even charged LESS than what I had been quoted when I booked the appointment.
Will definitely return next time I am in Vegas.

I had Campbell for my style and I was completely 100% happy with it.
Everyone was extremely friendly and helped me in anyway I needed.
I would recommend coming here.
