Awesome place to get your paint needs.
Allen was very nice and and knew his stuff.
I first called Carquest and had not 1 but 2 rude employees to talk to.
After Carquest told me they could not help me unless I found a paint code on my own I call D'angelo's.
Allen picked up the phone and it was a world of difference.
All of the sudden it was not a world mystery, they could get me the paint code and once I arrived at their store he had the paint on the counter in less than 5 minutes.
Thanks Allen from D'angelo's......stick it up your A** Carquest.

Great place for paint needs.

This place is awesome!!
The service is great.
Steve has done a great job helping us, and is now our paint guy.
We are doing our first full 2-stage paint job on a '67 Mustang and want to make sure it comes out great.
We have asked so many questions, and Steve has answered them all, given us tons of great tips, and guided us through the process.
He definitely knows his stuff and is happy to share his expertise.
We were never rushed.
He also is great about recommending products .
We decided to practice on a spare fender first, so he recommended practicing with a less expensive paint color that was available in a pint size.
When I mentioned I had the fender in the back of my truck, he came out to the parking lot to look it over and make more suggestions.
The prices look good, though we were prepared to pay more for the advice.
Body putty tools were cheaper than Home Depot, X-Glaze was cheaper than online, and the paint was about the same as online + shipping.
My two suggestions for first time painters:  - Go to D'angelos.
Much as I love Amazon, I can't get this kind of service online.
I've painted a bit, bought a few books and followed forums.
Still, expert, one on one advice about the specific products we are using were priceless.
- Buy a spare part or two to practice on - we got a Honda fender for $10 on craiglist
