Once more called the Greenmantle this remains a decent drinking establishment on the South Side of the city.
A handful of real ales (currently around Â£3.05 a pint), live folk music (at least on the Thursday I stopped in), still a good sized seating area and generally an unpretentious atmosphere so ideal as a crawl destination or for a session in one location.

I popped in here with an out-of-towner in search of a pub meal late (around 10pm) on a Sunday evening; the fact that its kitchen stays open till late is a definite plus, and for that reason alone this pub will get a permanent place on my list of places to go.
We were also treated to some quality live music (almost a rarity these days), and with a good folk band playing we couldn't help but tap our feet.
There is plenty of seating, a good selection of real ales for a decent price.
My friend was disappointed the fish and chips were unavailable, but was reasonably happy with his nachos  they won't win any awards, but filled the gap nicely.
Only downer was a slightly unpleasant odour near the bar area.
This could have been a one-off though, so it won't put me off.
