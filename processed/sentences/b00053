I came here following a student.
On trial basis.
It's kind a small place but very calming....havnt figured out why yet.
You feel spoiled here.
I only get my hair done here but planning to use other services soon.
I noticed that other clients as well get great personal services here.
It's nice to see men come here as well.

Tracy gives the best massages - deep tissue.
She is hard to get an appointment with because she is so good.
But it is definitely worth the effort to get in.
If I could afford it, I would get a massage from Tracy every week!

Jen Reid is an awesome stylist!
She does such a great job with my color and is the "brow-whisperer".
