DavidsTEA is a great tea chain that has a lot to offer.
You can purchse teas from a VERY wide assortment of teas and flavours with the opportunity to let your nose sample the scent of any tea they offer.
The atmoshphere for the shop is very inviting with a nice bright interior and with aqua accents as is the colour scheme of the company.
Employees are always incredibly friendly and helpful.
There is limited seating inside the show where you can sit down and have a hot or cold tea based beverage of your choice as well if you'd rather have something there than make it at home.
Long story short if you love good tea and variety this is the place to be!

I love coming here.
The staff are always patient and friendly, and Davids has the best flavours of any tea chain.
Highly recommended!

I go here often, and spend more than I care to admit.
The staff are quite friendly, they always give you a sample as you walk in.
They are very knowledgeable about flavours and can pair you up with the perfect match for your tastebuds.
If you are not a fan of flavoured teas, they do have a reasonable assortment of straight teas ranging in price point to from 6$ for 50 grams, to 20$ for 5grams, depending on the variety (white, green, pu'er etc.
)  and quality of the tea.
They run regular promotions and have seasonal teas, so there is always something new to try, and I have yet to get bored over the past 3 years I've been a regular customer.
I have been to other locations and this one is the most spacious I've seen.
There is some seating as well.
If lattes are your thing, they rival starbucks in quality and far surpass starbucks in variety of flavours.
If you like tea, or are interested in exploring loose leaf tea, I'd reccomend checking them out!
