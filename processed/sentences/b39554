After moving to Las Vegas, I wanted one of those mailboxes with a street address where packages could be received, etc.
I looked at the big name competitors and was not about to pay the high prices that they were asking (in my opinion) so after a little searching I found Mr. Ling and eShip.
He offers mailbox service, packing and shipping, notary, and a host of other convenient services too.
Check out his website, give him a call or stop in.
Be sure to tell him Randy sent you!
:-)

small business friendly and accomodating.
absolutely best prices in town (didnt realize how i was getting ripped off up the street!!

Stay away!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The owner is the worst and the customer service is awful!!!!
I had a confirmed delivery package sent to this store, my customer never received her package.
When I called he said "if there is no signature it is not my problem,  you should have a signature for packages that have high value" crazy thing is I never told him what the package was or the value so how does he know??
Not only that he said since I don't pay him he doesn't need to provide service to me and hung up in my face!
The rudest place ever!
It's weird how usps has proof the package was sent now he is acting as if he never received it!!
I can't believe it.
He is all about money!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Stay away!!!
