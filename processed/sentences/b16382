This was one my worst living experiences by far.
The maintenance men were jerks from the jump.
I parked my scooter in the future resident parking over night in the morning I found that the maintenance man had stuck a violation sticker right across the gas/mileage display.
Three months after living there a couple moved in directly down stairs that would argue nightly.
The police were called out on multiple occasions.
Management did very little to control the noise issue.
I complained several times.
I later learned surrounding neighbors complained to management as well, much to no avail.
The arguing went on for the remainder of my 13 month stay at the Cimarron Apartments.
There are a slue of other events that took place I just haven't the time to list them all.
Initially I thought I lucked up on a good location.
Once the dust settled I realized I was wrong.
Virtually every month I had to put in a maintenance request.
Sometimes they would respond promptly occasionally I would have to wait days and even up to weeks before my request was fulfilled.

This is the WORST place to live ever!!!!
Our water heater was leaking, we told maintenance over 3 months ago.
Nothing was done because they were "too busy.
" They finally decided to do something about after we had BLACK MOLD.
Did they remove it?
No.
They painted over the mold!!!
We went to break our lease.
My fiancè got in a fight with the "MANAGER" Danielle when we weren't even talking to her!!
She was very immature, making snide comments.
My fiancè said we were going to the health department and she added her two cents in again, stating, "We can go to the health department, we're so big and bad.
" Point is, this place sucks and is NOT for a family or anyone!!
Besides the mold, there's always cops, helicopters, ambulances and fire trucks.
Many neighbors are rude.
Do NOT move here.

I trashed the pool, but it's stlill cool!
