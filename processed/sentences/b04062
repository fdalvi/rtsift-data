I love this store.
They are friendly and helpful without being intrusive.
As a female, I've been treated poorly in several hardware stores.
But they have never talked down to me here.
Whether I'm looking for painting advice, plumbing advice, or help finding a specialty light bulb, the staff has always been knowledgeable.
And I love how it doesn't take twenty minutes to walk across the store.

Homeco  Ace has great manager special buys.
I buy a lot of things for my workers at this store- gloves, GoJo, paper towels, and even replacement parts for the machinery we work on.
I always go to Ace for items i need for home!
There is always an Ace worker around to point me in the right direction if I can't find what I am looking for.
I prefer Ace over the big box stores, it gives me personal satisfaction to know that my money is helping a local owner!

Awful service here.
Would not honor a coupon for propane in December, even though the fine print allowed it.
I let that pass, but yesterday they hassled me over a return with an Ace backed guarantee.
Cashier said "if we do anything would you want a refund or an exchange?
"  That ticked me off - "if"?
Had to get 2 other people involved before a manager took one look at the receipt at the product and refunded.
Why did it take that level when I had a receipt and the product with the guarantee plainly printed on the label?
Cashier told person in front of me that this location is closing- good riddance.
Update - manager responded, said they are not closing.
Maybe he should also let his staff know, as they are telling people that ASU bought up the strip mall and is running everyone out.
