Robert's work shows his artistic passion!!
I love my hair everytime he styles it!
(not too often you can declare that!
) Easy access off the 51 and Shea.
His intimate salon is charming with loads of his personality.
I recommend him to everyone.
Beliefs and work ethics make him a honorable business man.
Thanks Robert for all the joy you bring me.

So here we go... Yep, it's another review from me about what might be considered a 'girly thing' to a lot of guys.
This time it's a salon.
I know what you're thinking: "Us dudes are supposed to go to a barber where some angry Eastern European guy can cut our hair with a hacksaw and then carve us up with a straight razor.
" Well - get over it.
Robert's a cordial guy that happens to give an excellent haircut.
Robert charges a fair price, gives an excellent cut, and gets you in and out of the salon in a hurry.
Forget the foofy stuff at at the Scottsdale salons, forgo the crazy cheap and choppy haircut joint, and blow on past the angry barber - Robert will take care of your hair just fine!

Robert is a LIFESAVER!
No joke!
I got home late last night from a trip where I had mistakenly decided to get some highlights at an out of town salon.
This morning I asked around to see if anyone knew of someone that could correct my horrible orange hair.
Robert came highly recommended.
I text him early this morning and he asked me to come over to the salon so he could assess the situation.
He saw my distress and listened to my needs, just as the other reviewers mentioned on this site.
He promptly fit me in between his clients later that day.
He immediately knew what to do and fixed the issue in record time.
I don't think I've been in and out of the hair dressers that fast ever and looking this fabulous.
We made plans for how to get to the exact color I want in the future, even though I think my hair looks and feels wonderful now!
He saved me!
Will most definitely be returning!
Thanks Robert!
