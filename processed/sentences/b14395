Probably one of the largest and best Judaica stores I've ever been in!
I've come here several times to buy presents for the Holidays or when I needed to buy a Mezuzah or Mitzvah gift.
The folks who work here are very nice and helpful.
So, if you need some wine for a Shabbat dinner, or whatever, you need to come here first!
BTW, they also give some of there profits to the local Shul of your choice.
Nice!

Friendly and helpful.
There are several items to choose from.
I went in quick for one specific item and because I am not Jewish, I asked for help right away and I was quickly shown the item I needed!

Went in and found it way to expensive and over priced on most items.
I'm usually a fan of supporting local businesses, but can't do so in this case.
