First-time eating Lebanese food.
I had the Schwarma it was very good.It came with hummus/pita bread and a salad.
The hummus was excellent and the salad was simple and flavorful.
My companion had a gyro sandwich he enjoyed .
The young waitress was very friendly and very informative regarding the food and culture of cuisine.
Will go back soon for another wonderful experience.

As a parent this was not the place to take a kid, no kid menu.
As an adult I thought it was a huge establishment that should have had more going for it.
Perhaps I will try it out again in a couple months because the food was okay but nothing special.

Every time I make an attempt go eat here they are always closed.
I'm not even sure if they are still operating as a regular restaurant or just a banquet hall.
Very disappointing place.
