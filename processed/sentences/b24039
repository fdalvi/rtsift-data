Open play from 11:30-1.
This is a great rainy day activity.
You need to wear socks so make sure to bring them.
They do sell them for $1.00 if you don't have any with you.
You can also jump with your kiddos and they do not charge the adults to jump.

We recently used Pump It Up for a birthday party.
Great place for a children's birthday party.
Well organized enthusiastic attentive staff.
The staff took the time to remember the children's names and did a great job making my daughter feel special.
I recommend this to anyone looking for a great birthday party for children 4 and up.

The kids had fun bouncing around, the staff was friendly.
Pretty expensive though.
Would have gone to Bouncy Town instead, as they had better/bigger inflatables, but sadly they appear to be closed.
Also, beware that their cancellation policies are iron clad.
Our birthday boy got quite sick the day of his party (had to go to Urgent Care) and we were unable to cancel unless we paid the full price, as it was within a week of the date.
Sorry, not paying them hundreds of dollars to NOT have a party.
The owner/manager wouldn't even waive the $25 rescheduling fee.
Highly unlikely that we'll go there again.
