Sorry but I reserved online for this place.
I got there after 11PM.
There was a door you basically could not open without an attendant.
A number I dialed rang the inside phone with no answer.
I sat outside for about ten minutes with some awkward drunk guy pacing around.
Finally, someone else lets us in and I wait another 15 minutes for an attendant to actually come to the front desk.
NEVER going there again.
Thanks Hotwire.com

So I needed a place to stay driving through Madison and this place was cheap and easy.
I pulled in, went to the front desk and they couldn't find my reservation.
They quickly made calls and found it.
Turns out I was at the other one.
The other one?
Ya.
This company has two separate hotels on one property.
Kinda stupid if you ask me.
So I went over and they eventually got me in.
My room was nice... Had all the pleasantries and even a kitchen which was very nice.
But the place is a bit weird.
There was a group of guys drinking in the lobby (they looked like employees, but I can no confirm that).
But it was just awkward.
Not really a lobby that you'd drink in.... Also that was the only part of the place that was a bit dirty.
The workout room was a bit lacking....
But whatever.
All in all, this place had a "my wife just kicked me out of the house" feeling to it.
Kinda depressing.
But that's not their fault... Just kinda sad.

My husband surprised me with a long weekend in Madison, and we stayed at the Extended Stay on the far West Side of town.
When he called to make the reservation, they asked if it was a special occasion and he told them it was my birthday.
They not only gave us a free upgrade, but when we checked in, waiting in our room were a balloon, a card, and a beautiful bouquet of spring flowers!
Room was clean and staff were great--thanks, Tyler and all!
