I love dollar tree, how can you not?

What's there really to say?
It's a dollar store.
Compared to other dollar stores it's: -medium in size (not super tiny but not one of those crazy grocery ones either) -clean for a dollar store (but dirty when compared to say, Target) -has a decent selection of toys, fake flowers, junk food, party supplies, and baskets -an aisle with pool toys on one side and Christmas decorations on the other  Basically, when I'm throwing a goofy party for someone, I come here to get some goofy stuff for it.

In my opinion, the DT is super useful for 3 particular occasions:   1.
When you're living on a small budget.
When you're throwing a wedding and you're broke off your ass.
When you feel obligated to buy a gift for that ONE cheap friend that you don't really like.
The dollar tree is a really great place for people on a college budget..
I happen to go there all the time and buy make up, food, school supplies, and bath items.
although, it is a bit dirty and disorganized.
it's a place that believes that common and  necessary items (such as toilet paper and pregnancy tests!
) should come cheap and not overpriced.!!!
Out of CA$H ?!
The DT is your one-stop shop to afford the life you're living--coming to a neighborhood near you!

The worst dollar tree to go throughout the area.
Worst customer service.
Won't accept the q's and will give you lower value than what's indicated!
Worst store and doesn't even rate a one star
