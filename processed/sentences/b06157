Had an appt yesterday for my son.
After filling out all the paperwork, I was informed that they were not a participating provider for my son's primary insurance.
I told the girl I understood that and I wanted to use our secondary insurance and I would pay the out of pocket expenses (co-pay/deductible).
She stated that it's against their policy and we could not be seen.
I asked her what the problem was, and she couldn't tell me anything except " that's the policy".
As an insurance biller for twenty years, I cannot believe a doctors office would turn away a patient for no good reason.
That's a lazy office that can't make a simple phone call or print one more form to make sure their Dr will get paid.
It's easier just to say "no, that's the policy".

When I made my appointment and asked for the address of the office I was told it was on Windmill and Pacos, when I asked for an address the man on the other end said its on Windmill and Pacos, that's all you need.
Then when I got the reminder phone call the day before the appionmtnt, the lady leaving the message said, at the end, " oh, and it's $25 for a no show/no call" and hung up.
I thought that was a little rude on top of the address thing, THEN on the day of the appointment....my appointment was for 9am, I was told on the message to get there at 8:30 for paper work, I was a little late, arrived at 8:50 and they refused to see me and wanted to reschedule.
I told them this was a bad experience from the very start and I would be taking my business elsewhere.
I am sure the Dr is a good one, but the staff is extremely rude.
