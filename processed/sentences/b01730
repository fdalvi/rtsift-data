This is a horrible establishment !
The woman that runs this place is short and rude.
She completely ruined my wedding dress and refused to fix it and claimed not to see anything wrong with it.
She said its my fault the dress looks ugly because it's cheap and poorly made...
Which it's not at all.
She kicked me out of her store tho she did give me my money back.
Now another place has to fix it and agrees the work is awful and rodicas had no idea what they were doing.
Never never come Here !

I used Rodica's services almost 25 years ago and again today.
My daughter has used her as well ...
I have found Rodica to be absolutely great!
Her prices are very reasonable and her work is good quality.
The only reason I didn't rate 5 stars is because of her hours (have to leave work early to get there by 4) - otherwise quite satisfied.

INCREDIBLE service.
Rodica did my alterations for my wedding dress and it looks perfect.
She is very professional and does gorgeous work.
I am recommending her to everyone.
