So happy they opened up here!
Great taste& quick...my hungry soccer girls love this place.
Only problem is the crew is rowdier than every other jimmy johns I ever patronized before so that's why I am not giving it 5 stars.

Happy that they opened a store near me.
Sub and service is what you expect from Jimmy John's.
Gave 4 star because of bad location.
Difficult to see from Power Road.

Was excited to see them finally opening one up on our side of town, but was quickly smacked down by hit and miss service and quality of food.
It seems like 50% of the time we go to this location which was at least once a week when it first opened, the food was just plain not good.
Crust bread, all ends of peppers in the sandwich.
And the other half it was great just like Jimmy Johns is every where else.
So my recommendation is if you are driving down power go to the one on Southern if you can or the one at Gilbert and the 202, simply because you just never know what you are going to get from this location.

UPDATE  After another bad experience with them, having to chase my driver across campus, the owner called me and handled the situation very nicely.
I was not out for free food or anything he just seemed to really want to make the situation right.
To me that is what matters a little more than something bad happening on a visit.
Thanks Bo!
