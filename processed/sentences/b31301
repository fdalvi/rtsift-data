What's a guy doing recommending a woman's fashion boutique?
In one word "sexy".
Carine's carries a great selection of sexy, fashionable woman's wear at the Scottsdale Quarter.

fantastic, unique clothes are overshadowed by the snotty attitudes of the staff (not Carine or Randall).
Shopped there for the last time yesterday.
Not worth it.
Will spend my time and money at Elan or Mina's.

Very rude person who works here.
I asked for assistance and the lady was helping me, then a woman who was browsing left the store and then she said to me "see, I lost a sale because of you".
No one should ever be treated this way.
