So here's the deal - this is not a fluffy designer shop like you'll find at luxury brand dealership.
No marble floors, no customer lounge with a Star**ck's built in.
Just good ol' fashioned service.
These guys do what you ask them to - from a simple fix to get you by to alignments (yes they are certified for that) or even a complete engine overhaul.
If it's broken and needs to be fixed - they tell you.
If it's getting old and should be replaced, they tell you.
If you're a hobby mechanic and want to do half the work yourself, they're OK with that.
These are not "parts changers" with a computer system telling them what to charge or how long a job is supposed to take.
If you want to be changed hundreds of dollars to replace an entire assembly go to the dealership, if you'd rather pay for the $5 part that's broken and some labor come see these guys.

Chandler West Auto might not look like much but consider it a small mom&pop business.
I have been using them for 15 years after a hugh bill at SunDevil Auto sent me shopping for a better price.
They have always given me GREAT service and Good prices.
As a women many garages try and stick it too you NOT here.
If you like giving your money to small business then this place should be your go to auto repair shop.

Have been coming here for awhile Now.
Mike is a straight up guys and he and his crew will get the job done.
