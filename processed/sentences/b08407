Not a bad place.
Not a great place.
Pleasant enough service.
Fair pricing.

I've given this place 5 chances.
5!!!
And they have done a crappy job on my nail fill every single time!!
How hard is it?
I even speak up and tell them but it doesn't help.
They use too much product so the nail looks  super thick, don't even try to match other tip color if your missing a nail, and I always have small bumps dried in my polish.
They also play Vietnamese movies only...
I thought the tv was there to entertain the customers.
Guess not.
So, if you want a nice fill- go elsewhere.
