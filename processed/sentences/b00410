Initially was not happy with overall customer experience but after reading my yelp review the owner did go out of his way to make sure that I was satisfied.

I was looking to create some custom signs for my themed birthday party and turned to FASTSIGNS because it is located just a few blocks from my house.
I was really glad I ended up choosing them because my experience was really great.
To start with, when I emailed the online quote request, I got a prompt - and very thorough - response from Jeff.
Unlike some businesses that respond to quote requests with a zillion other questions, Jeff took a stab right away at specs/materials and an estimate.
This made me so much more likely to engage and really saved me a lot of back-and-forth (which I just don't have time to do during the work week).
When I picked up the signs, they were great quality and the work was as I pictured it.
I also thought the prices were reasonable for custom signs.
Overall, I was very happy with my FASTSIGNS experience and would definitely go back for any future sign needs!

We use Fast Signs for the vinyl lettering on our service vans.
Good prices and the colors hold up great in the AZ sun.
