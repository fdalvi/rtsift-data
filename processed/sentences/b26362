Inside Walmart.
20 dollars for spa pedicure.
Horrible pedicure!
The guy cut both my wife and I with cuticle nippers.
He cut my wife really, really badly.
Barely touch bottoms of feet, left tons of dead skin still on feet.
No massage just rubbed lotion in.
Massage chair and TV were the best parts of the experience.
I know 20 buck isn't much for a pedicure, but it was way to much for this one.
Oh and only kind of clean.
I was on the fence about if the foot baths were dirty or just old.

I went and got my eyebrows waxed.
The lady did a good job and the price was very reasonable.
Employees were very nice.

Don't speak another fucking language around your clients.
It's alienating & rude.
This is common practice at most any chop shop, but it's still worth mentioning.
That aside, its a sanitation nightmare.
My pedicure tech went from finishing the woman next to me, then over to me, with no glove change.
I had to say "uh I think you forgot to change your gloves.
" This, of course after she'd touched every fucking thing in proximity with the "feet gloves.
"  Ban all chop shops.
They don't give a rat's ass about anything but your wallet.
I'll keep my Madge the manicurist thank you.
