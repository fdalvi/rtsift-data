These guys say they have over 1400 locations, but I've never even heard of them until I moved over here from L.A.  Hungry for a little seafood, I stopped in here around 11 this morning for a first visit to this chain.
It's very nice inside for a fast food place, & has lots of comfortable UPHOLSTERED booths!
Some of the Combos on the menu are priced at just $4 & change, so I ordered two of them, & asked them to just put them together.
This brought out a plate piled high with breaded chicken breast, fish, lots of breaded shrimp, hush puppies, lots of fries, & a lemonade slush.
The food was good, & what a feast, for less than I paid yesterday at Chompie's for just a hamburger & fries!

There are far too few Long John's anymore.
They've updated their image a bit in the past few years with varied success, but the Broadway store seems to have handled the changes very well.
The new look is much cleaner with much more comfortable chairs and nice lighting.
The menu has added several healthy choices as well.
There's a general positive attitude from the workers more in line with a sit down restaurant than with a fast food place.
Very rarely is the food not fresh and hot.
I often have to wait an extra minute or two, but that's OK.
In those cases where the wait was long, they offered me a drink or a pie.
I will say that the fish and chicken come out great, but the shrimp often a bit overbattered.
Other than that, great food.

Good fast food diner!
Fried fish has tempura coating, and is very good!
It is what it is!
Not a place to go for a fancy, sit down, dinner, but great, every day, stop on your way home from work, fare!
