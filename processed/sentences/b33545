Amazing facility!
If your business needs managed services for your Phoenix NAP hosting solutions, ask us @theitworkshop - we can help!

This is an excellent, modern facility with good security and very friendly, helpful service.
We moved in a couple months ago and have been very pleased with everything.
Our sales guy was helpful but no-pressure, and continues to stay in touch to be sure we are happy.
The security guys are friendly and helpful.
The design of the facility is well done and highly reliable.

Feels like home.
DataCenter galore.
