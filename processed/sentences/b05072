This store has Coke Zero in their fountain offerings!

The chicken tenders had a weird rubbery texture and this was the second time so no more for me.

Second best Carl's Jr. in Las Vegas!
Food is always fresh and hot and service is very good.

Went through drivethru and was given the wrong food.
Went back to exchange and the staff thought it was funny, then refilled my drink with the wrong thing.
Disappointed.
