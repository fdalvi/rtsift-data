The staff is nice, but their product is consistently terrible and watery for whatever reason.
The seating looks like a nice enough place to chill, but given the alternatives I've never been particularly driven to do so.

This place is consistently busy, and I have often met people I know while standing in line here.
I figure they are here for the same reason I am: for the tasty beverages, good service and cozy environment.
They are, at this store, at peak times, often overwhelmingly busy, but I find the line moves fast and the servers are happy to serve you (and maybe make a little small talk as well).
In the wintertime, I love their Salted Carmel Hot Chocolate (which I have dubbed the SCHC) and often come here to get my fix when I am in the area.
I don't know why someone else give this place such low rating (maybe they were here on a bad day), but I heartily give my recommendation to this location.

My go to Starbucks when I'm in Waterloo!
I'll stick to what makes this location unique rather than rehash what everyone already knows about Starbuck's.
This location is right in the centre of uptown Waterloo which obviously makes it a popular destination for students and professionals alike so unfortunately this location is always VERY busy.
On the upside the staff is great and super friendly.
This location features my favourite lay out and seating arrangement than any Starbuck's I frequent with a very large communal table a great bar to post up at.
To put it simply this location is very popular with a cozy interior where young and old congregate alike to share good conversation and get some work done.
I want to give it four stars but because of how difficult it can be to find a seat at times I'm going to have to go for three.

Nice location
