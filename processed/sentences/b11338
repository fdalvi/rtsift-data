This is a very nice barber shop.
I felt very welcomed.
I have two boys with two very different texture hairs.
My youngest (6) wanted a frohawk and my oldest (10) wanted a mini Afro.
Mr.Shea did a great job.

I used to work with Mr Shea.
I decided to go to his barber shop after cutting my own hair for the past 20 years or so.
I wanted a new bald fade.
I previously called earlier in the week to make an appointment on Saturday.
Tank ended up cutting my hair.
Excellent job!
Will be going back every two weeks!
