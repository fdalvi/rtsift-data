I went to Shear Reflections a few months ago for a haircut.
Susan is the absolute BEST!!
I wanted a big change.
I had super long hair and she cut it above my shoulders.
I came in and told her what I was wanting to do and she was so excited to do something outside of the norm...I showed her a picture and off she went.
I absolutely LOVE my hair!!
After I got it cut tho, I had a hard time styling it the way that she did.
So I asked her what she did again to get some tips and she just had me come back in and showed me a few different things to do with my hair.
I thought it was awesome that she went that extra mile for me.
I won't go to anyone else anymore when it comes to my hair!

Love this place!
Very clean & modern inside and the hair dressers are all really friendly.
My wife and I have never had a bad haircut!

I've heard good things from a friend so I decided to drop by for a haircut.
I was extremely impressed with the cleanliness of the salon and how professional the staff was.
Pleasantly surprised - especially with the more than reasonable prices.
Looks like I won't be going to Great Clips anymore.

Kim is the owner and on top of the latest trends!
