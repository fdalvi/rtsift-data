I had MOHS surgery at this place and although the Dr. was very easy to get along with and did a good job, they charge 3 co-pays.
You are charged the surgeons co-pay, the surgery center fee and the Dr.'s co-pay for the plastic surgeon that closes the wound.
All of these are owned by Dr. Griego and housed under the same roof but are billed as separate businesses.
I feel that this isn't a fair way to conduct business and just a way to bring in excessive amounts of money from insurances and co-pays.
I have excellent insurance and have always payed just one co-pay at any other office.My wife worked for a MOHS surgeon in the past and they never did any of this.
If I need more surgery I definitely will not go back.

I had a very good experience with Dr. Griego and his staff and am pleased with the results of my Mohs Surgery.
I would recommend him to my family and friends

I have been a patient of Dr. Griego for 7 years.
I am 32 and have had several cases of basal cell carcinoma.
Dr. Griego is simply the best at what he does.

Seriously the best experience with a doctor I have ever had.
His staff was accommodating, professional, and caring.
Dr. Griego was efficient and professional.
He as excellent bedside manner and the most amazing thing to me was that he personally called me to ensure that I was alright and to go over the post care.
Not a nurse or office staff but the DOCTOR!!!
Truly amazing!!!
I highly recommend Dr. Griego to anyone who must have skin cancer surgery.
I have seen others but will only go back to him.

Finding out you have skin cancer is not very pleasant news but The staff was very courteous and accommodating.
The doctor was informative and the waiting room is nicely done.
