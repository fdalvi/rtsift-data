The Service was Amazing.
Called a few times with a bunch of questions & Jennifer was very Nice & Friendly.
Also super patient cause when people don't understand something they can be pretty annoying with mad questions.
Hehee  Shawn the tech & his son was Great.
They came right on time.
Very punctual which I like.
Don't like waiting around wasting time.
They explained everything & show me the results afterward at the end.
My bee hive & bees was gone under 30 mins which was GREAT.
Very Reliable & Affordable.

My family and I are critical of crumbs and any other clutter around the house yet silverfish and other crawlers were popping up repeatedly last summer so I grabbed a deal from Living Social around June of 2013 so that Affordable Pest Control could check out the home.
Aaron came out and sprayed the home completely and reassured me that the chemicals were pet-friendly after 15 mins or so to allow the agent to settle.
The initial education and the service was awesome enough for me to sign up for monthly sprays and Aaron is still my guy to this day.
Great down-to-earth, family business, maintaining professionalism and knowledgeable.
Worth the investment.
