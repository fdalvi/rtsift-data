Disclaimer: This happened a couple years ago, so maybe things have changed since.
I went to this guy to get a pair of slacks altered to fit my stubby legs.
He was nice until he surprised me with a kiss on the mouth and intent for tongue slippage.
Avoid, unless you're really lonely or something.

This man is incredibly rude.
I went to him for hems on pants and re-hem on a skirt.
I said him price of $90.00 seemed a bit high and he yelled at me and told me to never come back.
I hadn't planned to use him again, but didn't want to be impolite and tell him I wouldn't be back, until he yelled at me.

The last of the best.
Highly trained in Italy for years before e has mastered his skills.
Expensive but awesome!
