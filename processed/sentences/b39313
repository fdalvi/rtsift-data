awesome burgers!!!
love the garlic salt and pepper sauce !!!

The Garlic and Salt Chicken Tenders rocks!
Mixed greens was cool because everyone else serves regular lettuce.
Maybe next time I will try a burger because the Portobello burger looks awesome next to me.!
Not bad for a hole in the wall..!

Never been as mad at a restaurant as I was last night (which possibly should have been the time before a week earlier after they served me raw chicken and the only response was "oh, sorry" before throwing it away).
I came with 6 friends last night only to be greeted with a sign that they were closed for the night for a private party and please go to their other location on Decatur.
After finally gathering everyone together, we drove to the other location to find that one also closed.
WTF?!
Now you've wasted all of our time for no reason.
Totally disrespectful and unprofessional.
