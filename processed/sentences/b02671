I stopped by this antique mall recently and really enjoyed my visit.
The mall is laid out in standard antique mall fashion with booths and glass cases for vendors.
However, there was a lot more out on display than at other antique malls I have been to.
This location is larger than it looks with a back room to explore in addition to the main building.
Of course, prices vary by vendor, but I found most of them reasonable.
There are a few booths with a lot of information on the history of their antiques, which I liked - it's a lot better than throwing everything in without any history.
I didn't buy anything this time around but plan to return to explore some more.
What a fun place to look around!

I stumbled across this lil gem on my way to a different antique store and was pretty impressed.
It's your typical merchant booth set up, but it's a bit smaller than other malls so it's not so daunting to navigate.
There is your usual booths o' junk, but I have seen some pretty fantastic items for sale here.
If you are looking to browse some treasures, this is a great spot.
