There are three Starbucks here in the Valley that I go to on a regular basis and the service is consistent as is the product.
This location is one of them.
The staff is awesome, the manager, Terry (sorry if I spelled her name wrong!
) is on the ball and and has a well trained, oiled team.
I can not say enough great things about this Starbucks.

I love this place

I live this Starbucks because its right around the corner, the staff remembers my name and my drink, and it's conveniently by chase bank.
