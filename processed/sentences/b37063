The best thing I've done for Myself!
It doesn't take an expert in CrossFit to do CrossFit.
I quickly learned this is for everyone.
Over the past few months I've been able to reach my fitness goals that I set a LONG time ago but just never got around to it.
Thank you CrossFit Incite and the family within those blue walls.

Finally what I've been looking for.
It's an awesome place to get encouragment.
Great family and community at CrossFit Incite.

As a beginning CrossFitter, I looked at a few CrossFit locations and ended up joining CrossFit Incite.
I was a bit intimidated at before the first time going because it had been a few years since I had continually lifted and had only really been running on a semi-consistent basis.
However, I knew I wanted something that would kick my ass, get me strong and keep me motivated.
I have all that with CrossFit Incite.
The workouts are varied each day (as they are in any CrossFit box/gym).
I don't have to think about what I am going to do each day, I just have to show up.
The workouts are tough, too - usually quick compared to what most people spend at a traditional gym, but ass kicking hard.
Better yet, as you get stronger and build endurance, they continue to get harder.
The great thing about CrossFit is you're really working against yourself - continually getting stronger, faster, better.
I'd definitely recommend CrossFit Incite - whether you're a tenured CrossFitter or just thinking about getting started.

I went to this gym for a few months when it first opened.
The owner is really nice, you can tell he is dedicated in helping each person that visits his gym.
Crossfit is definitely not a slacker gym, so if you are really looking to better yourself health and body wise this gym is one of the best to go to.
Every Crossfit gym is different, for I have been to a few and by far this one was my favorite because of the coaches.
The coaches make the difference when it comes to Crossfit, because you need to be pushed to your specific max and if you have coaches that don't pay attention and really don't care you can hurt yourself or not work yourself out hard enough.
I have left this gym throwing up (in a good way) the best part was, I had more energy, I had toned every inch of my body and I added muscle.
I felt like I had my dancer body I use to have back in high school and this was after I had my son!
This gyms motto for the ladies is "If you still look cute after your workout, you didn't go hard enough!
" Great motivation for the ladies out there.
If your looking to work hard and go big I would recommend this gym.
