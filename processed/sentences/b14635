From my one time visit......
Person who took my order spoke less English than a Swahili immigrant.
It was annoying.
Food was luke warm and the string beans were very wilted.
Only good part was the awesome Mt.
Dew they had on tap.
I would advise a different Panda Express.

Still sucks, and YELP is still biased!
Why do I bother.

Service sucks, tiny portions, WAY OVER PRICED!
Will not return.
