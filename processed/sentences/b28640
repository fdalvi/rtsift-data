As with almost any large city, you can take a bus tour to see the sights.
Edinburgh is no exception, with a choice of 5 different tours, each offering something slightly different.
A couple of years ago, I took the Mac Tours City Tour when my dad and gran were up to visit.
The thing that makes the tour distinctive is the use of the old style Routemaster buses.
If you've ever travelled in London, you will know these very well.
There's just something about them, and they now have a somewhat legendary status in bus circles.
The route of the tour takes in both Old and New Town, along with the famous sights like the Castle, the Scott Monument and Holyrood Palace.
There is commentary throughout, ensuring that you never miss anything important.
This tour, as with any other, is best on a sunny day, and the weather was kind to us.
Tickets can be bought at the bus departure point on Waverley Bridge, and prices are in line with what is to be expected from a bus tour.
The ticket is valid for 24 hours, allowing you to hop on and hop off as you please.
This was a very pleasant tour, and definitely worth doing if you appreciate the old style Routemaster bus.
I will happily recommend this to those I know who visit the city.

Hop on  Hop of is great in any Town.
To me, it is one of the best methods to get common informations about the town and its history  worth the Price.
Edinburgh is a outstanding place!

Terrific tour that helped me learn and understand a lot more of Edinburgh rich history.
It was so great we actually took the tour again a second time to learn more and enjoy a second tour guides perspective.
I would highly recommend this tour.
The four extra pounds so you can switch between busses is definitely a great idea.
