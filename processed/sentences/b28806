This is another impressive Edinburgh charity shop.
It's just round the corner from a large BHF furniture and electrical shop, and keeps things traditional.
I primarily browsed the DVD section here, and was not disappointed.
Charity shops are the ideal place for a great bargain.
For example, whilst perusing the DVD shelves, I found 'Wanted' for the bargain price of £2.99.
All of the stock on offer seemed of a good quality, and I was impressed with the selection of things on all fronts.
As with all charity shops, you have to hunt around a bit, as they are not as meticulously organised as typical high street retailers.
I may have to come back and do a more thorough check of their selection.
Of course, the stock will change all the time, as is the case with charity shops.
An unbelievable bargain is almost guaranteed.

This Dalry Road branch of charity shop British Heart Foundation is an excellent find indeed.
I sometimes find charity shops a bit of hassle to browse, with an abundance of stock that so badly organised it just gives me a headache to sift through.
Not this branch, however.
It is so well organised that I could have browsed all day and they such an excellent selection of stock.
They have the most videos I've ever seen in a charity shop and all priced at 99p including Finding Nemo, The Land Before Time and The Singing Kettle!
The clothes were very reasonably priced indeed and the ones that I was looking at looked practically new.
The book range was excellent, and again, quite cheap, they have everything from The Broons annuals to horror novels.
My favourite piece was a pretty print that had a vase with poppies inside, it was really cute and only £5 but I just couldn't be bothered lugging it around all day but no doubt someone will snap it up pronto.
On top of the excellent organisation, great prices and stock, they staff were friendly too and if you're a fan of charity shops, trot yourself along the this branch of British Heart Foundation.
