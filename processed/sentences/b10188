These guys are exceptional!!
We shot a video in front of their store and inside!
They were great to work with and the deli is tasty!!
Definitely a great neighborhood mart

I wish there were more places like Ogden Mart here in Vegas.
One of the things I miss about NY is the damn delis (or bodegas, even).
I have yet to actually step inside this store, but I've ordered delivery a few times and the deli is solid.
Well priced, too.
I resort to Subway and its ilk out of pure necessity living here, but I just don't really get why people like those chain sandwich shops.
Where I come from, they're for n00b transplants and tourists.
Support your local businesses and enjoy your cold cuts freshly sliced!
Ogden Deli beats Subway (Quiznos, Port of Subs, etc...) any day of the week.
