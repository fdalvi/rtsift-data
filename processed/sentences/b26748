I went here for tailoring (to get one of my trench coats taken in) awhile ago.
The lady did a great job.
The end results were exactly what I had hoped for.
The stitching was pretty intricate so I was surprised to see it mimicked so well.
It did take her quite awhile because she had a lot of other clothes to work on, I think the store is a little understaffed, but I didn't mind the wait.
I believe it was well worth it.

We get out Air Force uniforms done here.
As with any cleaner and military uniforms you've got to tell them 5 times before it's done properly and sometimes it still gets messed up but meh it happens.
These guys are around the corner and are much better service wise than the other places  near by we've tried.
We'll continue with these guys for sure!

I just needed a dress pressed.
Excellent service.
