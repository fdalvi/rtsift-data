One of the best Dollar Trees in the Las Vegas area!
The staff is very friendly, the store its pretty clean.
Everything is organized and there is always a good selection of items to choose from.
I also love that they are open an hour later than most other Dollar Trees!

I like this places good prices and the ppl are nice here there always something you want or might want to get just cuz
