This is listed under YELP with a few different names.
I'm not quite sure if this has closed and reopened a few times, or WHAT is going on.
I visited this place on 1-4-14 and the name is Sumo Sushi & Grill.
For "across from the movies" sushi, it's not bad.
The girl serving me was freaking super hot  - but then again I just got done watching a bunch of T&A in Wolf of Wall Street so I was super horny and could have banged anything at this point.
I stuck to a few standards - miso soup, spicy tuna role, squid and one of their specialty roles called the NEW YORKER.
All were quite good and tasty.
The spicy tuna was really spicy and fresh.
Everything was clean and fresh.
This is definitely worth the trip.
This sushi place is right out front and across from the movie theater.
There is yet another sigh up that says "SUSHI COMING SOON" so I wasn't sure if another sushi place was going in, or this was it.

Went in tonight and had some seaweed salad, calamari, a Texas and Oregon roll.
Everything was really good and the waitress/hostess had them make the seaweed salad the way I asked, which was pretty cool.
Worth checking out if you want some sushi and are in the area.

Great sushi chefs!
Owners are great!
Beautiful place with chill patio.
Highly recommended.

We come here weekly.
This place is legit all the way around.
Awesome service, 50+ sushi rolls and probably the best happy hour around.
Awesome patio for outside, great atmosphere.
