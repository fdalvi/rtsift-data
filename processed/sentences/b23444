Owner is a greedy crook.
Supreme pizza is $8.50, hawaiian is $6.50.
Ordered half hawaiian/half supreme.
When I picked up the pizza, the owner charged $13.50 for an 8 dollar pizza.
What kind of scam is the owner trying to run?!
The d-bag owner tried to give some BS excuse that he doesn't do half/half on pizzas & instead doubles the toppings on each half of a single pizza.
WTF?!
I didn't order double toppings, a-hole.
Of course he doesn't tell you this when you order, he waits until you're picking up your pizza, charges you and hopes you don't notice the 70% mark-up on the price.
He then tried to explain that his way is cheaper by telling me that two large pizzas would have been $15 and he's doing me a favor and saving me money.
So what you just told me is that because of your little scam I just paid $13 for one pizza when I could have paid $15 for two pizzas?!
You just made yourself look like an even more of an A-hole, dude.
How anyone believes they can get away with trying to rip people off in the age of the internet is beyond me.
P.S.
I called 4 other Little Caesars franchises in the area and none of them charge 70% extra do a half/half pizza.

The 5$ pizza never fails!
We've come here a zillion times and the pizza is delicious.
I highly recommend it!
