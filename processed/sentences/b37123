This was my first time here.
The shop is quite bare, I guess it it quite new and getting established.
The lady at the counter (I think was the owner) was very helpful and I was pleased that they had violet liqueur, very tasty but hard to find.
I got the last bottle and it is going to be added to prosecco at Christmas.
A couple of folk came into the hop whilst I was browsing and all seemed to be regulars so there must be a keen following to this wine shop.
I liked it and I will pop in if passing, the shop was cold with a portable gas heater in the middle, so not the most luxurious place but charming owner and I was pleased o ind my liqueur.

Provenance Wines is a little gem in Tollcross.
It's not 'just' a wine shop.
They also have a very wide range of world beers as well as interesting liquors and good quality spirits.
The two ladies who manage the shop are extremely knowledgeable and will certainly recommend the perfect bottle of wine to go with that lamb shoulder or that chicken tajine you're making for dinner!
They have a good range of wines, not just French, and if you are a regular customer, you get some good banter!
Highly recommended.
