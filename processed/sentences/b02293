Called and stopped by about my T-Bird rag top.
I was helped immediately by Mat in a very friendly and professional manner.
As it turns out it was a simple fix.
Very honest folks that don't gouge anybody with unnecessary work.
Anything to do with upholstery, you can bet I will go back to Urbinas.

Horrible customer service.
I drove out to this place multiple times after being told on the phone that the "owner" would be in and the owner was never in!
I was told that he is the only person who can give a cost quote so the first time I went by they turned me away and advised me to come back tomorrow at 9 am.
Went in at 9 and was told that the owner won't be in til noon that day.
Next day I called and was told to come in at 10, went in at 10 and was told no one knew when he would be in.
This place dosen't care about its customers, there are plenty of good upholstery places in the valley, don't waste your time or money.

I called a local dealership and they sent me to see Gabe at Urbina Upholstery.
My husband and I were VERY PLEASED with the workmanship on our automobile.
He had our car done when he said it would be ready and the workmanship was EXCELENT.
WE WILL use Urbina's again.
