Sherri and her team are wonderful!
I met Sherri in Jan 2012 on the recommendation of a friend and she has been caring for my dogs ever since.
Sometimes I have day trips pop up and sometimes I travel for a few days.
I can always travel and not worry knowing Sherri is taking care of my dogs at her home.
My dogs just love her.
Sherrie is really good people and you need and want good people caring for your pets.
I highly recommend Safe Doggy!

I had SafeDoggy taking care of my 7 babies (3 dogs and 4 cats) for 13 days!
And I can guarantee it was the best part of my trip.
Paul did an outstanding job!
I received pictures and detailed emails daily.
That was the peace of mind I needed.
I could relax and enjoy my trip.
And for sure this is a long term relationship!!!
I found my pets very happy and I think they miss Paul's visit everyday now... My babies do love him!
Oh... Oh... Am I jealous or what???
Thank you SafeDoggy for everything!!!
I am not an easy person to be pleased and I am 100% satisfied with SafeDoggy / Paul!!

Sherrie watched our large, rambunctious dogs while we were on vacation in California.
I can't remember the last time I've been this happy with a dog sitter (and having lived in different areas of Vegas, we've been through a few)!
Sherrie didn't bat an eye at any of our care instructions.
She was very conscientious of our departure and return times, and worked with us to fit in a dinner feeding when we got stuck in traffic on the way home.
During the trip, we received multiple texts and pictures, which really set our minds at ease, as our dogs can be a bit anxious when we're gone.
But they obviously had a great time with Sherrie, because they were very happy and well-exercised when we got back.
Sherrie also kept paper notes on each day, which was a nice bonus, even though everything went as expected.
Now, I find myself unreservedly looking forward to our next trip, instead of worrying about stressing out our dogs.
Thanks Sherrie!

Sherrie watched my 2 dogs for 3 weeks and she kept me abreast everyday of what was going on.
My dogs took to her right away and she liked them right away.
I felt comfortable with her as well.
Sherrie called me when she need to know something and I called if I need to know how the dogs were doing.
She sent pictures and text messages.
I am so happy that I went with her.
I will be using her in again.
I will not be using anyone else.
If you want to go away and not worry about your babies then I strongly recommend Sherrie.
