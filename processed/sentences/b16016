What can I say?
It's taco bell!
When I have a craving for their hard tacos, it's hard to resist!
It's easy on the wallet and douses the taste bud's wants.
Another favorite is the cinnamon twists!

Top faves: 7- Layer burrito (vegetarian fave), soft taco, meximelt & bean burrito.
I've always had a thing for Taco Bell since I was a kid.
It's cheap and with recent studies-- it's HEALTHY.
I don't care if it's only 30% actual meat, it all comes out the same, right?
;)   Restaurant is nearby.
Dining area is clean, restroom is clean and staff is friendly, most the time.
Return visits?
All the time!

You know how when you were a lil kid, you wanted to go to McDonalds and get a happy meal?
Well, I rather have Taco Bell instead.
Weird huh?
I think that I've always been a big fan because of the cheesy goodness.
My favorites are the pintos and cheese, nachos supreme and chicken soft taco.
Sometimes I stray and get a Mexican pizza, but other than that I keep it simple.
I've never been here for dine in, but the drive thru service is pretty quick.
I will be back for sure.

I was eating at this location today, and was pretty impressed.
The store had plenty of parking spots around the building.
I believe there were 2 entrances into the diner, maybe even three.
The place was clean during Lunch time rush!
The employees were friendly, and easy to understand.
The service was very fast, and accurate.
I will be dining at this Taco Bell again!
