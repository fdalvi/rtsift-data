Also it will be helpful to bring a sweater with you as it gets mighty cold real fast when your walking around the produce, meats and cheeses.

Chef'Store is more like a restaurant supply warehouse that happens to be open to the public.
This means that unless you're looking to feed an army, chances are that the portion sizes will be way too big if you're shopping for just 2.
They do have some great deals on high quality items, and the freezer/produce section is amazing.
Since I don't have any need for a whole frozen goat, or a whole wheel of cheese, I won't be making too many purchases here, but it's nice to know that the option exists if I need to feed a lot of people.
Some examples of the varied items you can find here: halal meat, Minor's chicken base, kitchen utensils, bar stools, and Torani syrup.
