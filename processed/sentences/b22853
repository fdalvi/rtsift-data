When we moved into our home 2 years ago and had to tear down an existing gate, I really wanted something different, not the normal gate.
I started searching and found Dov the phone book.
He came out and we discussed what I wanted, sent me a picture of the drawing and wow what a beautiful wood gate I now have, it is exquisite.
I am so happy with it and have had many compliments, even people that are driving by stop.
Dov built, stained, and installed the gate.
He was prompt and always kept in touch , which is important to me.
If I had another project, I would definitely call on him to design another.
