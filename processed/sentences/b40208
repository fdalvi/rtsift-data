I'm a Goodwill refugee since they raised their prices.
Epic Thrift has good stuff but their prices are about the same as Goodwill's.
I found some nice things there that I purchased but if you know what you're doing, you can buy brand new clothes for almost the same price.

It's a new thrift store, that occupies what used to be Safeway.
I've stopped in a couple of times and didn't find what I was looking for - but I was looking for very specific things both times.
I haven't gone in to browse around yet.
There's lots of clothes, some knick-knacks, books...the electronics section is pretty sparse, but like I said - it's new.

I just love this place!
Every time I come in the staff is really nice.
There's tons of stuff to rummage through.
They give out 50% off coupons.
They have colored tag sales and also $1.00 days.
It's a fun place to shop and you can get killer bargains if you are savvy about these savings offers.
I probably shouldn't even say this but I am a part time online reseller and I have found great items to list in my Etsy shop.
The best part is that this place benefits the families of our troops.
It's win win win!
