My refrigerator and freezer was not working.
Ice melted, frig maintained temperature but was slowly getting warmer.
I called 4 different places on a Saturday and between no answer, being placed on hold for 5 minutes to being told they can fix it this Thursday, I thought I was out of luck.
I was fortunate to find Mike at All City Refrigeration.
We spoke and he said he would look at it for a fee and if he did repairs , the feed would be applied to the repair.
He said it was my lucky day and he was on my side of town and would be there in 30 minutes- right, that never happens.
Well he showed up in 28 minutes, took a few minutes and described the issue.
Thankfully it was one issue and not the other so it could be fixed today and under an hour.
30 minutes later, he was done and he was out the door.
Unit works better than 3 years ago.
I asked if he had a card so I could post something for him as I have experienced issues with repairman in the past;you need this now, now this,etc.
Mike is honest, does a great job and will even recommend what brand to buy for the future even though it may mean you won't need him again.

Well, when I called about my broken fridge he suggested because it's a compact fridge it wouldn't be worth the repair- the repair would probably cost at least $250 and another fridge would be $300.
So while I didn't get my fridge repaired, I give him points for the advice and not trying to get money out of me for a service I don't need.

Very unprofessional.
Very rude and condescending on the phone.
I would never hire such a rude person.
