This place is awesome, even better than Elvira's and the service is just as good.

Made a stop here before heading back aboard the Stennis.
Service was horrible!
There wasn't even staff here to seat me!
I had to come inside by myself and even cook in the kitchen by myself!
By far the worst service of any restaraunt I've ever been to.

First time dining here and it was awesome!!
If you are looking for fresh Mexican food at a good price this is your place!!
The servers were helpful, friendly, and professional!!
The restaurant and bathrooms were very clean!!!
Great spot in AJ!!!

Good food and super reasonable prices!
We were a pay of five and had 2 pitchers of margaritas, a kids drink with meals and the total was $48!
