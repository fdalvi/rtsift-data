I've been wanting to check out the new upgrades to the Tropicana, so I figured I'd try one of their newest restaurants and made reservations on our way to Vegas.
Upon arrival we were greeted by a manager who suggested the tasting menu, which includes both food and wine for less than $40.
Sold!
Although the patio/entrance to Biscayne is in a very white and bright walkway, the ambiance inside the restaurant is elegant.
The service we received all night from our server and his assistant was excellent.
All of the wine tastings paired very nicely with the courses.
The crab cake appetizer was probably the best I've ever had...delicious!
The wedge salad was a bit of a disappointment as the lettuce did not taste as fresh as I'm use to.
The buttermilk dressing and bacon served with the salad was decent but a little underwhelming.
The grouper with mango salsa was cooked well and was tasty.
We did have some issues with the filet, which we asked for medium-well, but it came out very well-done and tough.
Our server's assistant apologized and brought us another filet which came out medium/medium-rare.
A little undercooked for me, but the taste was decent and it was very moist.
However, I was not really a fan of the sauce which came on the filet, as I feel it took away from the flavor of the steak.
The dessert was a blood-orange sorbet which was enjoyable.
After our initial dessert, the chef made us a complimentary creme brulee, which was absolutely delicious and enabled us to leave with happy palates!
Overall, the food at Biscayne was about 3 stars, but with the excellent service we received and with the knowledge that they are a new establishment with potential...I'll give it 4 stars.
Till next time...

Five stars?
Whoa.
This place was great.
No, this place was perfect.
A five star review says two things; the food is breathtaking and the service is impeccable.
Biscayne is located in the newly renovated Tropicana Hotel and is hidden in a secret hallway that even Batman himself could not find.
Seriously, we had to ask three different hotel employees where the hell it was.
The headache to find the place was definitely, one million percent worth it.
My best friend was turning 21 so we did what most Americans do, we took a weekend trip to Vegas baby!
When we checked into the hotel (Tropicana) I shamelessly shouted out that it was my friend's 21st.
The lovely front desk attendant then notified the manager and he gave us a free $200 credit to their in-house restaurant; BISCAYNE!
How awesome is that?
We originally had reservations at a different restaurant but we changed the date immediately (duh) when we were given this free credit.
As I said before, the restaurant is pretty well hidden.
We had 9pm reservations and we didn't want the $200 credit to go to waste so we stuck it out and kept searching.
After finally finding the entrance we were a solid fifteen minutes late.
It took us about thirty minutes to find it (and we were staying in the same hotel).
Jeez.
When we got there we were seated immediately even though we were late.
To our surprise the place was completely empty.
Usually I take that as a bad sign and become skeptical of the quality of the restaurant.
That's exactly what I did here.
When we sat down we were given our table bread, butter, and water pretty quickly.
The table bread gave us three choices, but I only tried one, a soft pretzel.
My god.
I've had a lot of amazing table breads in my day, but I think I can safely say this was the best one yet.
We actually loved it so much that our sweetheart waitress gave us four of them to take back to our rooms after the meal was over.
To start, we ordered a couple appetizers to split between everyone.
We got an order of kobe beef sliders (with tilamook cheddar cheese) as well as lobster bisque (with poached Atlantic lobster).
Is it weird that we ordered one lobster bisque and passed it around the table?
Don't judge.
It was amazing and had huge chucks of lobster in it.
I'm not going to lie, but I definitely had more than anyone else at the table.
Score one for Kevin.
The sliders dish usually only comes with three (there were four of us at the table).
Our server asked us if we wanted to add just one slider to the dish so everyone gets their own mini burger.
I thought that was nice because most restaurants will require you to buy an entire second order.
The burgers themselves were great.
The beef was juicy, but not greasy, and the tiny veggies complimented it perfectly.
Biscayne is primarily a steakhouse, however I'm not a steak fan.
So much in fact that I would definitely be blacklisted if I were to live in Texas.
But I'm okay with that.
Anyway, my eyes went directly to the "sea" section of the menu.
The two things that stuck out most to me were the halibut and the salmon.
Someone else at the table ordered the halibut so I decided to get the wild Atlantic salmon (with chipotle pineapple yogurt sauce and seasonal vegetables).
The chef prepared that salmon so perfectly that I purposely wasn't given a knife.
As soon as I cut into the first bite (with my fork) I could tell how amazing it was.
The pineapple yogurt sauce was fabulous as well.
Usually fruity sauces can overpower and ultimately destroy the flavor of the fish (in my opinion) but this was done perfectly and the amount wasn't overbearing whatsoever.
To go along with my seafood obsession I got a side order of lobster mac and cheese.
Whoa.
Just... whoa.
I honestly can't write a review on the mac and cheese because the written word cannot do it justice.
Lets just simply say that it's a must order.
You're welcome in advance.
For dessert my friend got a birthday dish (complete with candle).
It was key lime cheesecake.
Being the nice guy I am, I put aside my cheesecake fetish and only tried one tiny bite.
I didn't want to completely devour my best friend's birthday cake even though every urge in my body was telling me I should.
The one bite I had was just enough to add it to the five star rating.
Even though Biscayne is hard to find, I'll say again, it's completely worth it.
I want to personally build a brick wall in front of it so it doesn't get revealed to the general public.
I even thought about purposely writing a horrible review so people wouldn't want to dine here.
I'm selfish, and I want Biscayne all to myself.
But being only the second to write a review I owe it to the chef and wonderful staff to give them the glory they deserve.
Now I can't think of a catchy way to end a review that gives so much praise so I'll give it my best shot...  Biscayne, until we meet again... that'll do pig, that'll do.

Very good steak and seafood selection, but I got they Wagyu burger which was excellent.

4 courses with wine.
$39.
Sign me up.
Wine is even a reasonably good selection.
Nice presentation with the food and its not bad.
The salad666, a cucumber consomme, and sherbert for desert were all good.
For the entre, had the boar ribs.
These were tasty but tough and dry.
Overall, its A-OK.  Not great, however, and would not be running back to this one.

Unbelievably nasty.
The service was fine, but the food was way oversalted and not good at all.
The pretzel bread served before the meal was good, but everything else we tried was terrible.
The chili looked, smelled, and tasted like dog food.
The eggplant tacos tasted like fried turds, and the fish was oily nasty fishy fishy stinky.
I will not be back to any of the restaurants at the Tropicana after this experience.

Save your money and go to Mastro's if you want a $60 steak!
Got the Wagyu expecting it to be top quality meat that tasted amazing...
Especially at $60 a pop!
It was mediocre at best.
I have made a better steak in my backyard.
Not to mention it was cold.
The shrimp scampi as well was cold and subpar.
My boyfriend and I love going out for nice meals and don't mind spending the money if it's worth it.
Definitely don't go here when you have the option to go to any of the other similarly priced steakhouses in town with way better food!
As well I asked for a straw when we first sat down...  We went through the bread, salad course and got our meal before I got the straw.
(Which I had asked for 4 times!

The only good part about staying at the Tropicana.
The food was awesome.
Apps, steak, and seafood were all great.
Our waiter as cool too.

Ate here on our most recent visit to Vegas because we spent the last night at the Tropicana, and it was wonderful.
The restaurant is located up the escalators on the 2nd floor from the main entrance.
The d√©cor is elegant and simple.
The ambiance was ruined a bit by loud passers by going to and from the pool.
Inside, the service was superb.
Often times, when you go to places that are nice and expensive, the service is subpar.
I should preface that my husband and I are not "fancy" dressers, but we like good meals.
So we are often given the "can you afford this" treatment.
Not here, everyone was very friendly and attentive and the server happily made recommendations.
We started the meal with this yummy pretzel bread and my glass of wine.
For dinner, my husband had the burger and I had steaks.
The steak was surprising large and well cooked, served with mixed veggies (a little harder than I prefer) and four sauces to choose from.
The burger was also very big with two patties and served with fries.
With all the food, we had little room for desert.
I would highly recommend this place for excellent service and similarly excellent food.

Thank You, Restaurant Week!
I wouldn't normally pick a Biscayne because it's inside Tropicana, but figured it's RW so why not take an adventure and check out Biscayne at Trop since it has been recently renovated.
Made reservations and we were sat right on time.
For a Monday evening this place was pretty busy... when we left about 3/4 of the tables were occupied.
We had 2 folks waiting on us.... and they were pretty good.
Our water glasses were never empty which gets points in my book.
Ambiance: Upscale, Casual The dining room chairs were oddly comfortable.
Lots of white and light colors accented with tall colorful vases.
Seems like it would be a good place to have a nice, power lunch... except that you do have to walk through the entire casino and go upstairs.
Drinks: Their regular mojito was not good... .watery and blah.
Their ginger mojito however was flavorful and fresh.
You do need to like ginger though.
Bread: Ok...not super great .... IMO the pretzel bread crust was weak and salty but the insides were nice and soft.
The other bread was a multigrain roll... again nothing super fabulous.
Conch Fritters: Light and Fluffy!
Not greasy at all.
This was a surprising find.
(Not on the RW menu.... we saw them and had to try them.
)  Eggplant Chicken Tostada: So GOOD!
The eggplant was thin and fried in a light batter... topped with shredded smoked chicken with a mango pico type salsa and bits of goat cheese on top.
Really great flavors that strangely work together.
Shrimp and Corn Chowder: Light, Sweet and Savory!
Not creamy and Not heavy.
I wouldn't normally order this so I'm glad this was on the RW menu.
It was a good summer soup.
Seabass (Bronzino-sp?
) with fancy sticky rice and a side of baby veggies: A bit on the fishy side but it was a good fishy...not a bad fishy.
And paired with the sticky rice was a nice compliment and complement.
:)  Coconut Sorbet: Silky, Smooth and Creamy.... not overly sweet and not heavy... a great light dessert.
Overall....
I'd say this was a Good Find.

had the restaurant week special.
Overall decent meal.
Especially for the restaurant week price (30.11).
The soup was tasty.
The steak was minuscule, but i suppose that's what you get for the price.
The waiter was very attentive.... perhaps even overly so.
overall it was fine.
looking at the standard menu, i suspect that if it weren't the restaurant week menu, i might think it's overpriced for what you get.
but the food isn't too bad.

Just about the only really really good food at the Trop.
3rd time eating here and its always wonderful.
The service is also outstanding here.
Top notch if you want to spend a few bucks and really enjoy yourself.

Great food and service.
Huge steaks

Our filet mignons were cooked to perfection and I loved the caesar salad dressing.
I wasn't a fan of the drinks but the service was great.
Located in the Tropicana right on the strip and the prices are very reasonable for the location.

I went for my bday dinner and it was delicious!!
I had the Prime Rib with bone and creamed spinach.
My boyfriend had prime rib with lump crab.
Both our meals we cooked prefect and flavorful.
I would recommend this place to everyone.
The service was excellent!

At first they said they were booked so couldn't accomodate us.
We wandered around....couldn't find anything that looked better so went back and asked if we could eat at the bar....which was just as quiet with the same ambience as the restaurant as far as we could tell.
Turns out you could order off the regular menu even from the bar.
Service was still good and you really couldn't beat the selection of wines for $25 a bottle....especially considering a glass of mediocre wine is 12 bucks in the casino.
We shared crab cakes (one of the best I've had and I am very picky about filler and crabcakes).
Also tried the ahi tuna appetizer and the only thing it needed was a little squeeze of lemon to make it buttery and citrusy.
Another highlight was the key west chopped salad.
I really wish I could remember everything in this salad as I would love to entertain with this.
I do remember that the dressing was almost a mixture of creamy vinagraitte.
Not sure how they did that!
Would definitely dine here again if in the area.

This wasn't near the experience I expected.
The atmosphere was only mediocre.
Seemed dated to me.
The service was good.
The food itself was not very memorable.
I heard great things about this place before coming, but was a bit disappointed.
Nothing bad, just not awesome!

my recent trip to vegas brought me to biscayne to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday.
the service of the staff was top notch.
i had to change the reservation twice because my boyfriend was playing in a poker tournament and it was very hard to guesstimate when he would be done.
they also accommodated my request to personalize his menu.
the food was very solid.
we had steak, scallops, and a side of lobster mac and cheese.
my favorite was probably the lobster mac and cheese because i had never had it before and there were chunky pieces of lobster in the dish.
i thought the scallops and steak were cooked well - kinda like how you would cook it at home, but nothing outwardly special or extraordinary.
our entrees did come with a variety of sauces and it was fun to dip our food in.
without my asking, the restaurant also included creme brulee on the house for my boyfriend's birthday.
we were so stuffed at that point that my sweet tooth was disappointed that i couldn't finish the dessert.
it was really very creamy and delicious.
AND it also came with its own raspberry like sauce.
if you order wine, the restaurant aerates your wine for you.
the riesling was crisp, slightly sweet and refreshing.
if you're looking to take a break from the craze of vegas for a classy, solid dinner in a place where you don't have to shout to be heard, this is the place to go.

To me, customer service is huge.
And to be honest, after a few weeks I don't usually remember the food I ate anyways, good or bad, unless there is something unusual.
What I do always remember, however, is customer service.
The fact that the owner is on here reading reviews and cares enough about a poorer-than-average review, is impressive to me and more than justifies a trip back.
Everyone has an off night here and there and this could have been the case on the evening I went to this restaurant.

I am always on the lookout for a great steak.
After dinning at this restaurant, the bar has been set a lot higher.
Never again will I go to the large chain fancy steakhouses.
I found out about this place via groupon and I'm willing to pay full price next time.
Dinner: I had the Dry aged ribeye-medium with a side of wild mushrooms, it was delicious!
As an appetizer we had the seared scallops with an aeoli sauce - Superb!!!
Customer service was amazing, greeted at the door, always attended to and a special thanks to Miriam for being friendly & patient with all of my special food requests.
Please note that the fact that this restaurant was inside the Tropicana, was making me question it's quality - on the verge of not wanting to try it out.
But I'm glad to say that Quality was 110% there.
Thank you

My husband and I like a nice meal out and are often on the look for something special.
Well, we found it.
This restaurant was in one word, fantastic.
To be honest, I was surprised.
It is inside the Tropicana, and although the Tropicana has been remodeled, it's a dated property and I ordinarily would never even have tried it out had we not received a Groupon deal.
So we went.
The hostess was great, the server was even better, and the steak was one of the best steaks I've EVER HAD.
Seriously..I don't know what they're doing to their meat, but I'll be back.
I'm sorry I don't remember all of the food we ordered but it was all superb.
At one point I looked at my husband and said, "What would you rate this place on a scale of 1 to 5?
"  He paused and stated, "A 4..but I don't know why I wouldn't give it a 5..I guess I'm just looking for some crazy WOW factor.
"  I couldn't have stated it better myself.
I gave this place a 4 but maybe that's just because I'm a spoiled Las Vegan looking for some Cirque performer to do some contortion table side or something!
lol   Honestly, this place is a gem and I'm so glad I took the chance to check it out.

It was a very nice surprise.
When you think of Tropicana you think old, smoky and 1970's, but things may be changing (at least it has for this steak place).
For a starter we had the short rib mac & cheese bits.
This was done well and an excellent start.
tip : Save some of the wine reduction cheese sauce for the pretzel bread, it's a good combination as well.
I had the surf & turf for $69.00.
It was a 6 oz filet with a Australian lobster tail.
The side was garlic mashed with chopped shrimp.
The steak was cooked perfectly, the lobster was maybe 8 oz and was also perfect (the waiter had said that the tails this week were larger than normal and he was spot on!).
The garlic mashed with the shrimp was awesome.
I don't EVER recall shrimp in a mashed side.
Great Idea.
The wine list was good to great.
It has a list of 25 current wine releases that can be had for $25.00 per bottle.
So you don;t have to over do it on the wine if you don't want to.
We opted for another Napa cab that was a little more than $65.00.
The wait staff was very friendly and knowledgeable.
Most reveiwers could easily give this 5 stars but for me it's  4 due to some of their clientele wearing jeans, t-shirt and flip flops ( but that's vegas for you).
Total bill before tip was $213 (1 appetizer, 2 dinners, 1 side & 1 bottle of wine).
You will not be disappointed.
We will definately be back.
( we've eaten at Charlie Palmer steak @ 4 Seasons in LV, so we know a great steak when we have 1)

Had a rare stay at Tropicana since I was comped a room, and probably my last.
I like the changes, but honestly, I feel the overall service and amenities of the hotel are average at best by Vegas standards.
Need to put in a LOT more effort to convince people it's truly "all new", not just new decor.
But they certainly don't go the extra mile to achieve that.
I know this isn't a review for the Tropicana, but it's relevant, because you have to go this hotel to go to Biscayne and the hotel is a big factor any time you're choosing a restaurant in Vegas.
I had a $50 dry aged rib-eye and $20 crab cakes.
Both were fine, I had no issue with either of them.
But if I'm going to pay that price, I expect the product to be exceptional, not fine.
There are so many awesome restaurants in Vegas, located in much nicer hotels, I can't imagine why anybody would choose to go here, unless they had to stay here... and as I mentioned above, I don't know why people would stay here, with so many other quality options.
I can't complain about the food, but the lower rating is for the price and location, which don't justify going here.
If I want to spend money, there are dozens of better choices.
Otherwise, I would be equally satisfied with a great steak over at Ellis Island for $8.
Sorry, but that's the truth.

Had my wedding dinner reception here on 5/5/12 for 20.
The planning staff was great to work with to schedule the event and choose the menu for our dinner.
We had a 3 course meal starting with (gigantic) shrimp cocktail or yummy crab cakes.
This was followed by an iceberg wedge salad or lobster bisque.
The main course was a choice of tenderloin, roast chicken, roast snapper, or rib eye.
I had the tenderloin which was one of the best I've ever had.
I had a bite of the snapper which I've never tasted before and it was prepared well - I would definitely try this again here.
Dessert was a key lime tart and I added a cannoli cream wedding cake which was yummy for being made in Vegas!
All of our guests sampled everything chosen and they each enjoyed the food.
We were all happy and stuffed by the time we left.
Not only was the food good, but the staff was on point for the event.
Some of our guests were late getting back from the chapel so we started dinner late.
Although we had to wait, the staff made sure we had drinks.
Hector took care of us and made sure our dinner progressed smoothly.
I would definitely go back to Biscayne the next time we're in Vegas.

**Summary**        - Decor - The decor is very clean and simple.
It makes me feel like I'm dining at some beach paradise.
- Service - The service was prompt and friendly.
- Food - The entrees seemed dry and lacking in flavor.
On the other hand, the appetizers/sides were delicious.
**Ordered**        - $15 Lamb Eggplant Tacos - Lamb Taco with goat cheese and a breaded eggplant as the shell.
It was probably the best thing about the meal.
It was delicious and innovative.
It could of been something out of Iron Chef (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rbDqCV2g23K3ZrTxmgoNBg?select=4KtY00KWU99393RcV5kq9g#nwFUiPRKUBmXRaaUH95j9w).
- $47 18oz Dry Aged Rib Eye - It comes with A1, Bearnaise, and a red wine sauce.
Even with the variety of sauces, I thought the steak was bland overall.
I usually like a more seared crust with a juicy interior.
Unfortunately, ordering it at medium rare, I got none.
It seemed more medium than anything.
The meat was marbled nicely, however none of that flavor made it into the meat (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rbDqCV2g23K3ZrTxmgoNBg?select=BZiMi51artxWJmBmAA_ymA#BZiMi51artxWJmBmAA_ymA).
- $38 20oz Prime Rib - The prime rib also seemed very plain and overcooked (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rbDqCV2g23K3ZrTxmgoNBg?select=XA17AEURnEE5YxYSWSrSdw#XA17AEURnEE5YxYSWSrSdw).
- $10 Lobster Mac & Cheese - Probably one of my favorite lobster mac & cheeses.
Large chunks of lobster improved the masterful taste of this sharp cheesy dish.
The crispy flakes on top add a great texture to overall creaminess of the mac (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rbDqCV2g23K3ZrTxmgoNBg?select=1DV1BO7WI3n1h8L3QMO_aw#1DV1BO7WI3n1h8L3QMO_aw).
**Recommendations**        - I have mixed emotions about this place.
I didn't enjoy the main entrees we got, but loved the appetizers/sides.
In the end however, I don't think I can recommend this restaurant since you can't really have a dinner on just appetizers/sides.

Really good food.
Service was nothing spectacular and price was pretty much out of our league.
We had a groupon that made it appealing to us.

My first time in Vegas!
I wanted to treat my boyfriend to a nice dinner to say thank you for everything since he paid for everything in vegas.
I was contemplating on Wolfgang's restaurant of Craftsteak but as we were buying discounted tickets for a show the people selling the tix told us about the discounted dinner and recommended biscayne.
The discount helped we were more incline to order more appetizers since our entree was half off.
We ordered the scallops, it was so good and silky.
The crab salad was the tiniest thing ever but with the pico de gallo mixed in with the chunky crab meat it was tasty and definitely refreshing.
For entree my boyfriend ordered the skirt steak, delicious it came with three sauces but in reality the steak does not need any extra sauce at all.
Very flavorful indeed.
I messed up my own meal by ordering the prime rib.
I like how rare it was but overall... flavorless i was eyeing my boyfriend's meal with envy.
The total with the discount definitely saved me money because usually with my boyfriend and i go to a steak house it adds to 200 dollars or more.
Definitely will come back to Biscayne next year.
Next time I won't make such a bad choice on entree.

We were going to a show in the Trop so we chose this restaurant since Bacio next door had ZERO atmosphere.
This restaurant has a nice menu and the prices are a little less outrageous than some of the more famous/popular restaurants on the strip but it's not worth the price tag.
Our dinner was fine and the bread and dessert were good but for $33 fish entree which came with a garnish and was just a grilled piece of fish (you choose the sauce) and $10 for a side of mashed potatoes I think you can do better.
I wouldn't AVOID this restaurant if I were staying at the Tropicana but there are many, many better places to eat on and off the strip.

Husband enjoyed his seafood pasta alright and our waitress was very sweet.
But I was sad that my "medium-rare" filet was very much over cooked and dry.
Disappointed for a $40 steak.

Food was a 2 &1/2 star, service is 0 stars, overall the two star rating is me being nice.
Never in my life have I had worse service at a "fine" dining restaurant.
This dinner was for family night, as we approached the restaurant there was no one at the hostess podium to greet us for a good 5 minutes.
When the hostess finally arrived it was past our reservation time and the table has not yet been cleaned nor set for us, we waited patiently for her to guide us to our table when noticing more than half of the tables were deserted.
Our waiter had a one large group and us to serve.
He came up to take both the drink order and the food order.
We were then neglected with no bread or butter which was being served across the whole restaurant but not to us, and we were also left with no drinks.
When the food finally arrived , our water finally came yet my moms drink was forgotten about.
The one and only good dish had there was the fillet!
It was cooked to perfection and accompanied with three great sauces for taste.
The sliders were disappointing and the bread was stale and cold.
During the whole dinner we saw our waiter twice, once for the order and another time for the food, but never for drinks nor the curtsy of checking on us.
Horrible service!

I was here a few months ago.
I bought the 1/2 price deal at one of the 1/2 price ticket booths.
I thought because I bought this the food wouldn't be good, just a lame way of getting people in your restaurant, BUT.
I got the bone in rib eye, it was by far the BEST STEAK i had ever eaten.
Aged perfectly, Cooked perfectly.
For a side i got lobster Mac and Cheese which was also very great.
I will absolutely return and with the 1/2 price deal it couldn't be better.

We stopped by before the Laugh Factory.
The host suggested the bar so we said great.
Our host was great and pleasant and was also our waiter.
We had scallops appetizer and the steak skewers.
They were great sized portions and the scallops were perfect, however, the steak was way over done.
THE BIG NO NO here is the bartender.
I ordered a tequila with lime and soda water.
I watched him pour the drink - he made a typical margarita and at the end he put a small dollop on tequila - less that an ounce.
I have never seen anything like it.
I said that was not what I ordered and asked for wine instead which was very good.

Went for appetisers and wine.
We ordered the pan seared scallops with asparagus and Churrasco beef skewers with jalapeno cherry jam.
We were the first ones in right as they opened the doors for dinner service around 5PM, so we had the place to ourselves for a while.
The decor is really lovely, though we were both a little sick of the music.
Is all of Vegas contracted to play nothing but Sinatra and Buble?
The scallops were huge and perfectly cooked, the asparagus nicely crisp-tender, the aioli was great; I wanted to lick the plate.
Instead I used some of the variety of breads from the basket they served, all of them excellent.
One was a pretzel-like roll and the other was an oatmeal roll.
For the first time ever we at all the bread served, except for the one roll my mum stuck in her bag for later.
:) The Churrasco beef was a little tougher than I would have liked (maybe that's how it's supposed to be?
) but VERY flavourful.
The jalapeno jam was more cherry than jalapeno, but still very good.

Came here for dinner three nights in a row and enjoyed each night I came, but if I went another night, I don't think I would've enjoyed it as much because their menu is limited.
The first night I came to Biscayne I ordered the started seared scallops with asparagus.
The scallops were beautifully cooked and the sauce along side was a delicious combination.
I also shared the caesar salad with a friend.
I saw on yelp they give whole leaves of lettuce so I had them chop up the leaves.
The salad was a little too overdressed for me, but it was still good.
For my entree, I ordered the smaller filet mignon.
It came with brussel sprouts which were delicious, as for my steak, though I asked for medium-rare, the outside looked dry and kind of unappetizing.
For dessert, I got the key lime tart.
The plate presentation wasn't very elegant but after eating such a heavy meal, it was nice that the tart was light and fairly cleansing.
The second night for dinner my grandparents ordered the seasonal oysters.
They were so good!
Not slimy or gritty at all!
Some were a little small but others were fairly well in size.
For my starter my grandmother told me to try the eggplant lamb tacos.
The salsa that came with the tacos was delicious, but sadly the tacos themselves were too oily for my liking.
I also ordered the french onion soup, it wasn't too salty like many can be.
I ordered the crab legs for dinner and they were pretty good.
Nothing super special but what I like most is the fact that they cut them open for you.
No need to get your hands dirty from peeling out the meat yourself!!
And for dessert I ordered the apple tart-thing.
It's like baked apples over a phyllo dough chip served along side caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream.
The caramel sauce with the ice cream was great, but the apple tart itself wasn't super good.
I rather have an apple crisp like dessert instead.
Finally on my last night here, I started with the lobster bisque.
Usually, I like my bisques, but because this was a lobster bisque, it was REALLY rich and salty.
If you like rich foods, I suggest getting this.
I then got the shrimp scampi, starter.
I didn't realize it came with a lobster sauce, so great MORE rich food (I hope you hear my sarcasm).
My aunty ordered the shrimp scampi the day before with a lemon butter sauce (which is what I should've asked for but forgot), her's looked delicious!
So by the time my entree came, I was already filled with soo much rich and heavy foods.
I ordered the seared scallops for dinner, that's SIX fat scallops cooked to perfection.
I sadly could only eat 2.5 of them, I felt terrible for wasting them but I just couldn't fit anything else in my stomach.
If you come to Biscayne, definitely try their scallops and oysters if you have the option!

Ordered the Aged Rib Eye and was almost uneatable, It had no taste and consisity of a NY, the wine I had to send back.
never go there again

Delicious food.
Probably one of the best veal chops I've ever had in my life.
And great service too - attentive without being overly present.
Also, we ate here with very little time before having to get to our Cirque show.
They were very prompt in getting our food out to us and the check thereafter.
I will definitely be back.

Service and food are excellent!
Loved the scallops and the lamb and eggplant tacos.

The fiance and I choose one nice restaurant to try every time we visit Vegas.
This time we are tried Biscayne and I was very pleased.
The service was decent.
She was nice but not friendly, if that makes sense.
We started with the short rib mac n' cheese bites.
Tasteless.
(it gets better, I promise)  We had to add salt to get some flavor out of these.
I was really expecting SHORT RIP mac n' cheese bites to taste like something.
A little disappointing.
Now to the best part, the main courses...I had the scallops with the citrus sauce.
They were amazing.
The scallops were cooked perfectly and the sauce went perfectly.
We ordered the mashed potatoes to share as a side and they were really tasty as well.
The fiance and his dad had the rib eye and they were cooked spot on and seasoned really well.
We were all very happy with our main courses.
I would try this place again and probably stick with the main dishes.
The ambiance of the restaurant is really nice and chic.
It was enjoyable.

Excellent food and service!

Ok appearance is across from an Italian place.
We were sat in middle of room It was ok seating tho heard the bar blender was very loud.
Ceasar Salad wasn't right, served like a wedge, taste wasn't right at all.
The laziest Ceasar I've ever had.Waited a while in between chorses.
Pork Mac n cheese diff & good.
Steak I had was ok nothing special.

My amazing parent-in-laws hosted my husband and mine's (seriously... Is that proper English?
) wedding rehearsal dinner at Biscayne and everything was beyond what we could have desired!
The head chef designed a custom menu for our party of 20, and made of evening magical, intimate, and SO SAVORY!
The food was beautifully prepared and our waiter was top-notch.
I wouldn't call myself a bridezilla, but it being the day before my wedding the last thing I needed was a less than amazing rehearsal dinner and Biscayne surpassed that.

Come down to Biscayne tonight!
Try our special, Cabernet braised short ribs with creamy mushroom risotto!

Excellent dry aged steak at this steakhouse located at Tropicana Las Vegas.
Quality food preparation and presentation; excellent service and attention to detail.
Good wine selection.

Delicious and fresh food, excellent appetizer portions, small entree portions, good service.

Very comfortable, nice music, great lighting.
The filet, scallops and asparagus were all wonderful.
Cayetano was so pleasant and gracious and our waitress, Miriam was perfect.
Overall a wonderful dinner and experience.

Pesto sandwich was delish.
The tacos were bomb, especially the especially the lamb, eggplant that had the goat cheese that went w/ it.
The mac & cheese was also good, as always.
My friends love the tacos here.
She keeps thinking about them, even day-dreaming lol

The meat was pretty good and the service was also attentive, but similar or equal quality can be obtained from less expensive places.
I found it a bit insulting that a 50 dollar filet mignon does not come with a side order which was an additional 11 dollars.
Is this typical of expensive places?
Also if you are getting the 50% off the main dish deal through tix 4 tonight, you won't save much, they will add an 18% gratuity off the original price, not the discounted one.
I would recommend to go instead to McCalls Heartland Grill at the Stratosphere.
Similar service and quality for 1/2 less.

Stepping into the Tropicana is like going back in time.
It is nice, but you can tell it's been around a while.
The Biscayne is the diamond in the rough.
Upscale and posh.
If you are looking to be treated like royalty run to Biscayne and hurry.
Our waiter, Ken, was top notch.
So attentive.
Superb service.
The aged bone-in ribeye is like eating a piece of heaven.
A side order is enough for two.
I can not say enough good things about this establishment and the service.
WONDERFUL.
FABULOUS.
INCREDIBLE.
SUPERCALIFRAGILISTICEXPEALIDOCIOUS

Had the Sushi which was good and a wedge salad which was great.
No doubt the steaks are top notch but I just wasn't in the mood

The Cook sends out little snacks sometimes... the last time I was there he sent out goat cheese and whatever he used with it, made goat cheese taste good... Yum!
Although the Caesar salad could have been more flavorful, the steak, scallops and veggies were really good!
Wine was great and so was the service.

I had a very nice dinner at Biscayne on a recent trip to Vegas.
The amuse was delicious, but I didn't hear what my waitress said it was!
I had a lovely beef carpaccio.. the beef was perfectly shaved and served with capers, some very tasty buttered and toasted bread.
The olive oil was drizzled on a bit too thickly, but overall this was a really nice dish.
I ordered scallops for my main course and the waitress asked if I wanted the entree size or the appetizer size.
She said there are 3 scallops on the appetizer and 6 on the entree.
I was glad she told me and I went for the appetizer.
It was the perfect size.
The scallops were really big and cooked very nicely, they were served with a nice light sauce and some grilled asparagus.

Went her for dinner and was blown away.
Being in our hotel my expectations were not the highest.
I was very surprised.
The service was spot on from our server Roland and the food was amazing.
I had a fish and shrimp special that was wonderful.
My wife tried the New York Strip and enjoyed it.
The sides and bread were excellent also.

The food and service here was incredible!
Our waiter, Dave was great and played along with four young individuals who were "enjoying" themselves!
He even gave us frozen mugs for the beers we brought in.
We even brought him a beer after we left as a funny souvenir!
It was great!

The service here is fantastic.
As a group of 21-23 year olds, we were not expecting to be treated as well as Ken, our waiter, treated us while we were there.
He made the experience truly worth breaking our meager college student budgets.
The food was outstanding, we had the prime rib, the caprese salad, the shrimp scampi, another steak of some variety, the sliders, the french onion soup, and the clam chowder--all of which was delicious.
We showed up at the restaurant because we were staying in the tropicana, and now given the opportunity we will all certainly go back!

VERY surprised by this gem in the Trop.
I love the Trop, truly, but it's essence as an old person casino didn't leave me expecting a 1397-star dinner.
But, holy cannoli!
From the moment we arrived at the host station to the end of our meal, we were blown away.
Our table had: Cocktails at the bar prior to the meal  Luna pinot grigio Pan seared scallops Watermelon amuse boush  Lobster tail Porterhouse Dry aged rib eye Surf and Turf Mash of the moment (suped-up bacon mashed potatoes) Harissa corn Lemon asparagus  Seasonal veggies (squash) Deconstructed banana cream pie Trio of brules Gelato  Not one of the four of us (yeahhh, 4 people ate ALL of that) could find fault with anything during our dinner.
We were all incredibly satisfied!

I've been coming back here many times- for the food and the wine list.
Admittedly very steak focused it is a wonderful steak menu.
The staff are very knowledgeable about their wine list--which I very much appreciate.
The food is excellent- in particular the heirloom tomato and burrito with artichokes is truly quite good.

This steakhouse is amazing.
The fillet and lamb chops are a must here.
It is located inside the Tropicana Hotel and Casino and overlooks the pool.
It is a great setting with very to little no noise from the Casino.
It is more expensive than most, but you are most definitely getting what you pay for.
I highly recommend this place for steak, seafood, for anything in between.

Few high class restaurants appreciate a group of rowdy mid-20 year old Las Vegasers.
But Biscayne handled it with poise and played along.
Using a high-class steak joint as a pre-game for the night clubs (ballin!
Vegas is so crazy), my buddy and I of course walk in with Miller Lite cans.
Our waiter Dave laughed and even brought us frozen mugs to enjoy our brews in.
The rest of the meal was amazing.
Meat that was just flown in, delicious sides, and taste testing from the kitchen.
Our next round of drinks (sadly) was not Miller Lite cans from our hotel room floor, but drinks from the bar and they were superb!
Great experience!
Enjoyed the staff enough that we presented Dave with his own fresh Miller Lite on our way to the clubs

So after reading a lot of positive reviews we decided to try this place.
Decor looked nice and casual.
The server named Alex showed us the drink menu and we decided to try the Bellini.
($12) It was just a champagne glass of red colored champagne.
For the entree we ordered the dry aged ribeye and the seafood chopped salad.
The ribeye was over cooked, dry and served on a cold plate.
No way the meat is worth $50 so we sent it back.
Alex suggested we should try the regular ribeye instead so we did, but it wasn't much better.
The salad was very small - smaller than a typical half salad.
We do not recommend this restaurant.

Excellent place, hidden gem in Las Vegas.
4 stars due to server lack of knowledge on wines and the small side dish that comes with the aged rib eye that I ate, tasted like it was out of a microwave.
Other than that, originally was not thinking that such a place existed at my hotel.
The TV in my room was ranting about the quality of the food and reviews from tripadvisor.
I looked it up, and the TV was right as well as Yelp.
4 stars!
I had the scallops for appetizer,  excellent stuff.
Would highly recommend.
Perfectly cooked, and that is a difficult task for scallops.
I followed that up with the aged rib eye, asked for medium rare, cooked to perfection, added the foie gras butter, mmmmmm, which was forgotten originally (another reason for lack of 5 stars)!!
I added the side of roasted corn, excellent!
Loved it as a corn lover.
Finally finished with the deconstructed Banana Cream pie, excellent.
The banana type chips were a little rubbery, but didn't ruin my meal favor.
All in all, will not be disappointed.
Total bill for myself, including a $60 bottle of wine = $160 with tip.

I had my wedding dinner here with 16 guests.
The food was amazing, and the service was outstanding.
