Old Navy!
The place to go for affordable clothing in Madison that doesn't cream Cheap-o like a lot of the "Wet Seal" type stores do.
Always fantastic sales and the clothes are uber-flattering.
I just picked up a knee-length tweed coat for about $50 and I get compliments every time I wear it.
The staff seem to enjoy their jobs as well.
5 stars!

Nice size store with friendly service and a good selection of sizes.
The fitting rooms are sometimes a bit messy, but that's not really a big mark against the place.
Casual fashion at reasonable prices and jeans that fit less-than-skinny ladies.
Woot!

I haven't been to Old Navy in awhile, but I popped in last night to find summer shorts.
I didn't find any.
I usually head straight for the clearance section, and often find clothes for just knocking around for $5 or so.
The store is clean and the staff is friendly, so I have no specific complaints other than I didn't find anything I liked.

Old Navy is one of those places that I totally forgot existed until my sister became employed there.
Now, I shop here at least twice a month.
They are forever having some kind of clearance or sale going on and they a lot of sizes.
I believe they go from an XS to a XXL, however, if they do not have your size in stock, they will call over to the West side Old Navy or order it for you online.
I have found it that online does have more plus size apparel.
They sale shoes, accessories, skirts, dresses, shorts, hats, bags, graphic t-shirts and so on.
Great store to go to if you're looking for a nice spring dress for a great price.
You can also apply for a credit card and get approved immediately.
