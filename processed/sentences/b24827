nice store

Standard Circle K, pretty tidy for being under construction.
Restrooms could use a little tending and the food warmers could use some more grill items.
Be careful of the hill turning onto the street next to it, it's a bit steep and it's easy to bottom out a standard sized sedan with passengers if you don't take it at the right speed and angle.
Our cashier was also very quick and polite which is always a welcome response at a gas station.
