I have been bringing my dogs to Dr. Brinkmann since my dog was blinded by another ophthalmologist here in town.
Dr. B was able to save her eye from being removed  however her sight could not be restored because the damage caused by the first doctor(?
) was too great.
I take my dogs every 6 months to see him and his wonderful staff.
Dr. B is the most experienced eye doctor for animals in Las Vegas and I recommend him highly.

Dr and staff are amazing!
You can really tell this is their passion.
I always have to bring my two small children with me, and the staff always has coloring books, crayons, and snacks to keep them occupied.
Thanks for taking care of my four legged furry baby ;)

Dr. Brinkmann was recommended to me by so many and they were absolutely right!
He and his staff are amazing!
