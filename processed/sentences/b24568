Great nightclub/restaurant on the west side...
They have great bands on Friday & Saturday nights, excellent food, and extremely friendly owner & staff.
Clean place, cool atmosphere, relaxed without pretension.

We ALWAYS have a great time here!
The staff is very friendly, the place is casual but lively, and the music on the weekends has never disappointed.

Great place to watch NFL games.
A ton of tvs.
Typical bar food (fried, fried, and more fried).
Not a great selection of draft beers, but the drinks are cheap.
Two pool tables get a fair amount of action.
If you like classic/hard/butt rock, you're in luck on the weekends.
Typical clientele looks more dicey than they really are, though I probably wouldn't go here on a first date.
You won't be shunned if you don't drive a motorcycle, have tons of tattoos, or have a handlebar mustache, but if you do, you'll be able to blend in easily.
Cute waitresses and bartenders are a plus.

"Dark in the city, night is a wire Steam in the subway, earth is a fire..." She swayed languidly, as her hips gyrated in a seductive and carnal manner most unbecoming of her age, "Do-do do do, do do do, do do do, do do do, do do" while human sexuality has no age cap- her guttural languorous dance proclaimed her wanton desire for every ripe male drop of lust she could glean.
"Woman you want me, give me a sign And catch my breathing even closer behind Do-do do do, do do do, do do do, do do do, do do..." The tempo of the live band increased, as the staccato and drunken attempts at dancing of the desperate middle aged men in the room filtered onto the small dance floor.
"In touch with the ground I'm on the hunt i'm after you.." The unbridled passions of the room intermingled on the dance floor as we stared in revolted awe, like a train wreck we scoffed at the hook ups that were just kindling, and those now fomenting to completion.
As another pitcher of cheap domestic beer arrived at our table, we greedily drank the sudsy tincture and stared questioningly at the bacchanal in progress.
"Smell like i sound, i'm lost in a crowd And i'm hungry like the wolf..." As the band would calm, so too would the mating rituals of the patrons, suggesting some proportional relationship between the two.
In my clouded thoroughly drunk brain I thought to myself the nature of that formula and deduced it to be congruent with the amount of drink imbibed.
"Straddle the line, in discord and rhyme I'm on the hunt i'm after you..." Now the atmosphere and liquor had worked its spell upon us, we rose to our feet, compelled by the news that this was to be the mediocre blues bands last cover song, zombielike we made our way to the empty dance floor "Mouth is alive with juices like wine And i'm hungry like the wolf..." As we danced in utter ridiculous parodied fashion, the revelers were drawn to our presence like moths to flame, they sought any excuse to continue their rituals, and ensure themselves a partner in the darkness of the night, and cougar claws came out as they vied for their kills.
"Do-do do do, do do do, do do do, do do do, do do...."

Great little neighborhood bar.
Went to watch football on Sunday and had a good time.
Beers were ice cold and not expensive.

One of the best bars I have ever been to.
And yes they are open don't listen to google.

Average bar with average prices and servers.
The place has plenty of TVs without being ADD and the food was rather good.
I would suggest the chicken philly with a side of wing sauce.
I would go back to check out the bands.
That would be cool.

Cute little neighborhood bar.
Not my cup of tea- but seemed to the perfect place for the guy that just wants to watch the game -and not be distracted by any courtship rituals...There was a small percentage of women there- but looked like that is what they were there for too.

It's just a big man cave.
Shut your trap and chug some $3, 25 oz.
drafts while you spend your Sunday watching the game.
The selection ain't fancy, but the seating is nice.
When I watch my team kick some ass, I need nothing more than a mug and some elbow room.
If you need to light up, there's a little patio by the front.
This place is chill.

Awesome Bar and great food and live bands... Also don't forget..

Serviceable sports bar with decent food.
Wider draught selection than I'd expect for a strip-mall location.
Excellent service but was a quiet Sunday night.

When I pay money why would I go to a place where it feels the servers don't want to be there?
I attended one of their open mics and it was the only saving grace, although it wasn't original music.
If I wanted to hear the songs that were being played I would have gone home and cranked them up.
I like to listen to raw, untalented, music that jams whatever the genre.
All in all the people were awesome to talk to.
Lots of kick ass regulars.
Prices were the same as any other place.
Atmosphere was inviting.
I might go back there again.

Great live music, open mic night Tuesdays, pool tables, trivia, and more!
Kimmy does a lot of fund raisers for the community as well as frequent fun, special events.
They also have some of the best waitstaff/servers around (especially the irreplaceable Theresa).
Check it out, you won't regret it!
