I loved this shop so much when I was studying abroad in Edinburgh that when I saw that Yelp was in the UK, I immediately looked up this place to review it.
A million wonderful things to say: - Just about the only place to get American-style (not Canadian-style) bacon in Edinburgh - My introduction to fresh mozz cheese--OMG so good when paninied!
- Friendly staff--a must when you're studying abroad so far from home!
Drool--just thinking about a chicken-bacon-mozzarella panini with tomatoes, lettuce, cucumbers and pepper from this place is making me miss Edinburgh.
A lot.

Small friendly sandwich shop with a Dutch influence.
The owner is always friendly and great care and attention goes on making every sandwich.
There are a few seats inside if you want to sit in but it's just a few paces from the Meadows where you can enjoy the outdoors and have your sandwich on a park bench.

I've been to Lagermans for lunch after lectures in George Square plenty of times and it always offers a tasty lunch at a reasonable price.
It feels like a delicatessen inside with plenty of continetal breads, fillings and some inspiring decor.
The staff are welcoming, friendly and know about all of the good foor which they sell.
My personal favourite is a turkey panini with loads of salad and salad cream - tastes amazing.
Further, it's all served in generous portions with plenty of exactly what you ask for.
You can get a delicious sandwich with a drink for just Â£3 which is a decent deal.
Lagermans is ideal for a cheap, filling and tasty lunch if your in the area.
