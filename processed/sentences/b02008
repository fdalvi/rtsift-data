This place is a rip off.
I will never go back.
They quoted me a price and I paid it.
Now they are demanding more money.

Staff is great and Buddy the therapy dog is awesome!
Have gone here many, many times with great results always!

Been going there for years.
Great knowledge and customer service!!!

Wonderful people work there!
You really get to know them and become friends with them!
It's my second time going there and it really does help!

Buddy the therapy dog is awesome!
Tony was immediate on finding the problem with my daughter's ankle injury from volleyball and basketball.
They recommended stretching and strengthening her hamstring and quad muscles...gave us bands and exercises to go home with and NO physical therapy necessary.
We were referred from Spiral Volleyball, and would highly recommend them.
Easy to make an appt., friendly and knowledgeable staff.
Was a quick in and out, and didn't have to wait forever.
