Called my warranty company cause my toilet was leaking out the bottom.
They sent this company out and I have to say, the guy did a very good job.
He fixed more than I thought he would and did the job right, and because it was through my warranty company I didn't have to pay any extra.
Would consider calling this company in the future (warranty or not).

They came out during the scheduled time slot and that's as far as I can comment in this review.
A broken machine always works when the repairman shows up!
Lol.
My garbage disposal turned on as soon as he flipped the switch and hasn't had an issue since.

Had this guy out for some home warranty work.
Clueless.
Charged an additional $40 for a tub spigot because, he said, it was solid brass.
CHEAP PLASTIC.
Now, they won't return my old spigot.
