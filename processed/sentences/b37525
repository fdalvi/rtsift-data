LabCorp, you know, the place where you get blood drawn.
This is the Tempe location, notable because it is open on Saturdays.
On Saturdays, they open at 9am and EVERYONE wants to be first.
Get there at 9:05 and the place will be packed.
The guy who took my blood was relaxed, friendly, and very good at what he was doing.
If you don't mind a wait sometimes, this is a good place to go if you need labwork done.

This is a very sad and scary lab.
The location moved from a fairly old and dingy space to a newer location, however the people seemed to have only gotten worse.
A comment by one yelper "attitude of prisoners" is right on the mark.
I've never experienced a phlebotomist cracking their knuckles in front of me following an request if they could be gentle with the needle since I can bruise a lot.
Regardless of how ridiculous and too common this request may have seemed to this 20-something, male, health care professional, there is absolutely no excuse for their ignorance or mannerism towards a patient.
I hope he never works in a setting where a patient would be helpless to request another phlebotomist.
He shouldn't have a job working with people under any circumstances.
Fortunately, the substitute professional was okay even if not apologetic.
They all seem terribly unpleasant making this a difficult place to visit.
Working in a health care profession I understand that stress related to a rushed schedule is largely to blame on marginal reimbursements by 3rd party.
At the time I was there, they were very slow.
Two stars given for one out of two professionals being okay and the newer facility appearing clean and bright.

Slow slow slow, why in the name of god is a express lane not used for people simply dropping something off or taking a drug test....worst management of customer time I have seen.
If you are coming here pack a lunch!!!
