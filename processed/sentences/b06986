A regular lunch spot for me, I generally prefer Cousins over Subway.
Cousins has seven inch half sandwiches (as opposed to Subways six inchers) and for some reason, that extra inch really makes a difference for me (I can't upgrade to a whole sandwich because that's too much).
I also enjoy the fact that you don't have to specify yes or no for every single sandwich fixing, which is a major annoyance for me at Subway.
The employees are friendly and they have all the regular goodies that you might expect (e.g., fresh-baked cookies, chips, etc.

Great subs and great deals at this location.
Perfect for student.
15 inches for under $6 and much better than subway.

Look, working downtown means that I have tried the sandwiches at every chain place in town, be it Subway or Silver Mine.
I say with confidence that Cousin's is the best cold sandwich you can buy.
This place is really simple, with about a dozen sandwiches that have lots of meat, good vegetables, and good bread.
The portions are the biggest for the money in town.
Admittedly the meat isn't fantastic, but it is recognizable what meat you are eating.
Furthermore, if you try and get too fancy with ordering hot food etc, you will probably be disappointed.
But, if you are hungry and want a sandwich close to the Capitol, this is the place to be.
