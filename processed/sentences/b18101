One of the worse experiences I've had at Bath and Body Works.
First of all, the store reeked of their new fragrance when I walked through the doors.
I was in the store for five minutes and my clothes lingered with that scent.
In addition, the scent was so strong that I got a headache.
Ouch.
Yeah, I like Bath and Body Works stores, but there was  way too much body spray or perfume around that entrance door!
I still like the Mango Mandarin and the Pumpkin lotions at Bath and Body Works.

Wallflowers.
2 for $5 Brown sugar and Fig.
Don't judge me.

I love there products!
This is my favorite location, they are always so friendly.
No matter how busy they are you are never ignored.
I love there sales and the coupons I get in the mail.
Yes the store has strong scents but duh that's why your there, my favorite are the floral scents.
