I am extremely happy with my new hair extensions.
Scheduling was super easy and convenient.
Installation was faster than anticipated and completely painless.
Carmen is a true professional.

I visited Glam Live shortly after they opened with my 8 year old son.
He and I were desperately in need of hair cuts!!
Carmen was great!!
She did a fantastic job of getting my son to sit still and be patient while she cut his hair.
This has been a challenge in the past with other barbers/stylists.
She then cut my hair, and did an excellent job of giving me exactly the look I wanted.
My son and I both walked out looking much, much better than when we walked in!!
I'd highly recommend Glam Live Creative Studio for anyone who wants to feel better about how they look!

I love doing hair and building my own brand along with such a good team.
Come experience our culture and fall in love with our style.
