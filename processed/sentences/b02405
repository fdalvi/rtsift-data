I love this place.
Been going here for years.
Always had great service and my dogs are clean and perfect.
Every time on time.
Plus I know that the owners love all the animals!

These folks couldn't be nicer or more accommodating and they did a beautiful job.
We'll be using their services again!
NB: They have moved from Gilbert to 4018 E. Main Street.

Nice friendly little place.
My dog looks great, and saw two others leaving when I was there, they looked cute, the owners wanted the dog clipped shorter and the front lady wasn't thrilled but did get it fixed.
They took good care of my dog and she looks super cute!

I have been going to PL for years after a bad experience with a different groomer and have been happy and satisfied ever since.
I usually have two dogs at the same time and they both look great and happy when they are done.
Rest assured you pet will be treated as you would treat them at home.
