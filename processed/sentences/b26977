I have had this company doing my insurance for a while.
Matt Gregory is my agent and is great.
He is always honest and fair with his pricing and will go the extra mile for his clients.
I have had great customer service and timely responses from Distinctive Insurance.
Insurance companies or brokers usually don't provide the level of customer service that I expect, however i have never had any issues here.
Currently all my personal and business insurance is with Distinctive Insurance.
My husband is a sceptic and had me quote out prices with various "TV" insurance companies out there.
NONE could beat the deals I got through Matt.
I really hope it stays that way.
Honestly I refer friends to Matt all the time, but this business is noteworthy for you Yelpers.
Please consider them when needing anything.
I haven't found a better company yet.

As a result of my recent divorce, I needed a new auto and renter's insurance policy.
Distinctive Insurance was recommended to me by a friend and I couldn't be more pleased.
I worked with Leonard Marler.
He was helpful and informative.
As my ex-husband handled our insurance needs for a number of years, I had tons of questions.
Leonard answered all of them and made the transition easier than I ever expected.
Distinctive Insurance sent proof of insurance to my old auto insurance company (required in order to drop my old auto insurance policy) and also to the DMV.
I would definitely recommend the company.

Great agency that offers great service.
Very knowledgeable in the area of group health coverage.
