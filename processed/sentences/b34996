If you can avoid the masses of school kids in the morning, this can be quite a nice Starbucks!
The fare is standard but the staff are lovely and very good at what they do.

It's Starbucks, you know what you are getting.
Friendly staff, decent muffins and a pretty good flat white at a decent price.
What A-ok was made for!

Starbucks is Starbucks.
I'm not a huge fan of big coffee chains but this one has the advantage to be conveniently located, particularly to meet friends based at the Merchiston Napier Uni campus.
They have recently changed the furniture and you now get a long benchy couchy things with plugs for your laptop and little tables.
Sort of ideal if you need to study or do some work.
I don't go there often enough to have my own opinion about the staff but I've been told by a regular that they are really friendly and know your name and your drink if you come often enough.
Now cleanliness.
Jeez sort it out!
The place is a mess.

4 stars.
For a Starbucks?
Yeah.
I'll be really honest, I'm not a huge fan of the coffee the whole chains sells, but the staff at this branch are really nice, and it makes a huge difference when you get your morning coffee before heading for work at the nearby uni :)
