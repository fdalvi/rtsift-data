RIDICULOUSLY OVER PRICED.
Fruit cup was 2/3 filled and cost 7bux.
Even Starbucks is cheaper..

I was actually just looking to buy a cheap bottle of water (lol right) but saw a veggie wrap here and figured I may as well try it since I wouldn't be eating for several more hours at least.
For the price (~$4-5) I've had much better and in bigger portions, but as far as airport food stalls go it wasn't the worst I've had.

This stuff is terrible.
I tried their blueberry and strawberry yogurt parfait and the blueberries had gone bad.
Lovely.
Tried their southwest veggie salad which promises chopped hearts of romaine (in reality- iceberg which has zero nutritional value) Monterey Jack cheese(which was completely missing from my salad) and chopped red onion (which is huge chunks of white onion).
If that weren't bad enough, the salad dressing tastes like cold condensed Campbell's tomato soup.
F*^%!+% disgusting.
