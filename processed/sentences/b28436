Worst experience I have been through.
I own several rental properties in the valley and gave these guys a shot.. big mistake, after I was quoted for the glass, I had to call 4 different times to get the final amount.
The glass was installed on a Friday, and I had 3 voicemails on my phone by Wednesday (as I was on vacation) for immediate payment or else a lean would be placed on my property...5 days, counting the weekend and Memorial Day Monday.
After I called back telling them of my experience thus far, no apology was offered.
I let them know that I would pay them when I received the bill which I was told they would email to me.. What do you want to bet I don't see that for another week if ever?
There are plenty of good glass companies in the valley; I tried these guys out so you don't have to.
Be warned and go with someone professional, it's certainly worth the few extra bucks.

This company is extremely professional and ethical.
I have worked with them for around 5 years now.
Only ONE time was there ever a small issue and Brian made it right immediately.
They are a great company, have very qualified techs, professional, thorough, knowledgeable, trustworthy, responsible and reliable.
Can I say more?
yep....other companies that I used to work with can learn very valuable lessons from Alliance Glass and Door.

fast service, fair pricing
