Fedex SUCKS!
I worked for an internet company years ago who shipped fedex.
After years of crappy shipping service we switched to UPS.
Best choice that company ever made.
9 times out of 10 when I use fedex for personal use, the package doesnt get there on time.
And when you use express shipment they will hold the pkg in their sorting facility until the due date (even if it gets to the facility  days earlier.
)  Have I mentioned Fedex sucks!
Use UPS instead.

FedEx has always delivered.
I use frequently and highly trust.
I can spot the amateurs who are trying to ship.
Yes, the clerk does need the correct address, someone does have to read your handwriting.
For the pros, we can use on-line and print out forms.
I normally try to drop off in the early morning or early afternoon.
They close at 6 and the lines are long.
They have a plane on the runway at 7, so if you are procrastinator and think you can get in at 6:15, you are out of luck.
I don't want you to delay my package, so get your act together.
Also, save some money and pack it yourself.
Don't think UPS is any better, both FedEx and UPS use high speed belts, so get bubble wrap and pack it good.

Went to this FedEx and received horrible customer service.
I realize my packing job wasn't perfect but the tone of voice and attitude of the employee was very condescending.
She made me feel like an idiot for packing my own products.
I am huge believer in good customer service with a smile.
There was even an older gentleman in line before me and I could tell she made him feel very uncomfortable.
The only reason I give this location 2 stars is because the other employee there was nice to me.
If you're looking to ship something by FedEx you might want to go to another location.
