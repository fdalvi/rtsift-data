A great local gas and stop, it's super close to my house and always clean.
It's close to a lot of great places in the Northwest.
Nothing great or outstanding to report but if your out of gas or live close by it's not a bad place to stop by.

Quick, close and clean

Gotta live $0.49 medium slurpee!!!!

This gas station has everything!
The convenience store inside has a Domino's Pizza and a full service post office where you can buy stamps and ship packages, all while only waiting in line behind 2-3 people!
The gas pumps outside never get too crowded so you never have to wait.
I often come drop off a package and pump my gas and I'm off within 2-3 min!
Pricing also seems pretty competitive for gas.
