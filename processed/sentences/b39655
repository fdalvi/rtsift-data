I've been coming here since they first opened and I won't go anywhere else!
Great chairs, friendly staff and excellent work!

Went with my wife, great new chairs, however another quantity over quality place with an unpleasant owner, my wife would go somewhere else next time.

Very beautiful salon, decent prices - nothing out of the ordinary.
I think the guy I had for my pedi is new/inexperienced.
Still nice though.
Will probably come back, but request someone else.

They were not very friendly or inviting.
My nails were not done well & they did not seem to care about the quality of work.
