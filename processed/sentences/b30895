Carrie is very professional, friendly and personable.
I always feel like I'm catching up with a friend.
She does an awesome job and gives honest feedback.

I would be lost without my "treatments" from Carrie.
I have had the pleasure of going to Carrie for over 5 years.
Her quality of service is alway "top notch".
Above all, Carrie is extremely professional, caring individual who is dedicated to making you be your  BEST!

Carrie is awesome.
I mean look at my lips, I am fabulous!
I started coming to her in 2007 and do not trust anyone else but her.
She is very sweet, knowledgable and helpful.
I never thought I would let anyone touch my face, but with Carrie I feel safe in knowing she truly is an expert.
She always tries to find you the best deal via rebates and coupons too.
I highly recommend her to anyone considering botox or fillers.
