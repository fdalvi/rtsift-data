I'm with Joshua P.  I have never been to a Barnes and Noble that was less friendly!
I have seen floor employees avoid eye contact and scurry past me when I could REALLY use some assistance.
Odd layout that is unlike other Barnes and Noble stores, and unfriendly cashiers.
The west side store is way better.
Update:  This store continues to be a disappointment.
HUGE turnover and unfriendly staff.

full disclosure: i work at this bn.
working in a mall environment completely changes the tone and harmony of any store, especially a bookstore.
if you experienced BAD service (such as unhelpful or received incorrect info) versus were not able to find someone to help you, i would ask for the reviewers to be more specific--everyone i work with has years of experience in retail AND is really knowledgeable about our products.
also,if someone is avoiding your eye contact, they might just be trying to get off the floor to take a lunch break.
just sayin.

Staff members are always helpful and they have an Educator Discount Program.
That makes purchasing books (for the classroom or home) a little bit less expensive and makes up for the fact that sometimes B&N is a touch pricey.
