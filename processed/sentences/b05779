Good donuts and coffee.
Nothing spectacular but definitely would come back.

I still can't get over how I paid $2.99 for a coffee and 3 doughnuts!
What a deal.
I was debating whether or not to go to Krispy Kreme or Winchells but decided on the latter since it wasn't a chain and I could get Krispy Kreme elsewhere... .
Winchell's shares space with Subway which was a little random but I didn't have any problem with it because the woman helping me and what I assume to be the owner were both very nice and sweet.
I hadn't eaten doughnuts in a little over a year so I decided to go with a boston creme (one of my favorites) and got a chocolate glazed chocolate doughnut for my sister and a glazed for my friend....
They were by no means the best doughnuts I had eaten before, a little doughier than I had expected but it definitely hit the spot.
They hadn't skimped on the cream and it oozed out of the doughnut with every bite and I was more than satisfied with my choice.
I didn't try the other doughnuts but all my sister said was that it was okay as she scarfed it down.
Would I come back again?
Sure, why not.
I will probably be back for EDC 2013 next summer so till we meet again Winchells.
Keep up the friendly service!
YELP 365: 159/365

Stale donut holes 14 for 2.49.
This Winchells is connected to a Subway.
Got the breakfast $3.00 combo and they wouldn't even let me upgrade to a bottled water which I am most accustomed to back in California.
Really you couldn't charge me the extra .25 like other Subways, I'm willing to pay.
I figured since these two stores are connected there by the same ownership.
I give you 2 stars because I got my sandwich and donuts in one place but allow for upgrade please.
It's ok if you don't I'm sure I won't be back.
