This is definitely smaller than the farmer's market downtown, but that isn't a bad thing, personally I've grown to hate the sluggish crowds down on the square.
This is a nice smaller market, prices seemed like they cheaper than what you find downtown too.
Plenty of parking of course, since it's in a parking lot.

I love summertime in Madison because you can find a farmer's market just about any day of the week.
This Sunday market really delivers.
You can munch kettle corn or crab rangoons while you check out the bounty.
It's smaller and more compact than the downtown market--and that's just my speed.
Unlike many, I am not a fan of hot spicy cheese bread, so I don't miss it at all at these other farmer's markets.
The tamales sold here are SO much more delicious.
