I've used Erik"s catering for numerous events large and small, formal and casual.
What I love about Erik's catering is the no matter whether I have a large or smaller budget in mind for an event, he can always provide me with a beautiful presentation and a great meal.
Always professional.
I've done several different themes representing all different types of food.
Always with great results and rave reviews from my guests.
I highly recommend them!
P.S.
they also do doggie cupcakes and parties!

I have used Erik's Catering for numerous events, my anniversary party, graduation party and I have also used him for a small dinner party I had.
I met Erik when I attended San Gennaro.
He has great food and presentation.
I would love for Erik to be my personal chef.
GREAT, GREAT SERVICE AND PRESENTATION.
