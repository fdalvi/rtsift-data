How refreshing to find a nice, NORMAL full service car wash in Phoenix!
This place opened about a month ago, & I got around to trying them today.
The staff was friendly, the price ok, & they got my car nice & clean inside & out.
The biggie for me here was that these guys didn't hound me with upsells!
I was able go get the car wash I wanted, without having to argue with anyone.
Can you imagine?
The cashier was a little hottie, too!
What more could you ask?
:-))  Full Service Car Wash $8.95, with a wide range of premium services & auto glass replacement also available.

Super friendly, no up selling like most places.
Great selection of air fresheners.
I'd like to see them start selling refreshments but oh well.
My favorite part is they don't have those annoying guys trying to replace my windshield every week.
I'm sold!
