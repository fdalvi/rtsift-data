This Wendy's is a training facility.
You get what what you pay for.
If its something they don't have to assemble your safe, otherwise don't even slow down to make the turn.

Previous review: training facility, I guess that says it all.
I tried to stop in last night for a quick bite but after waiting about eight minutes to get to the order box no one took my order.
I got a "be with you in a moment" twice before I just drove off.

Absolute worst service.
Tremendously long wait.
Three cars took over 15  minutes in drive through.
Each car waited 5minutes to order.
I thought they were ordering a bunch of burgers but when it was my turn to wait it also took 5 minutes.
Poor people stuck behind me.
There goes their entire lunch break.
No quick burger run here.
Drive a little bit further and get done quicker.
