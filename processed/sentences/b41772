I cannot say enough about Mary.
She was the best!!
My mom and I were in Vegas for work for a few days( from Denver) and we felt that we needed to bring my mom's dog who is a 14 year old Bichon Frise.
He's blind and a little slow, so he needs extra love and attention.
We love him so much, that we were really having a hard time trying to figure out who would watch him while we attended meetings.
After getting a referral, we spoke to Mary and instantly got a great feeling.
She came over to the hotel room and met with us and Polo and we all hit it off.
Mary watched Polo a few different times, and at no point were we nervous or worried about him, we could tell he really enjoyed her company.
We could also tell she really really loves dogs.
Mary has such a kind spirit about her.
We wish she lived in Denver, so we could use her services more.
I would absolutely recommend Mary!
Especially for those doggie parents who get a little nervous about leaving their little ones at a doggy daycare etc.

Mary is the best pet sitter I have ever had!
She is so kind and caring towards my husky Mia , I was completely comfortable leaving Mia in her care.
She sent me updates while we were gone and there was even a little report for us to read when we got back!
I will never use anybody else now that I have found Mary!
