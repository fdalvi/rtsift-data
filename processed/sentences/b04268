Love this place.
Clean, nice people and great prices!
The owners and the staff are super nice and very pleasant.

I have gone to the salon for 2 years.
Everyone is excellent.
Tina is fantastic.
Kathy, Joe and Diamond  are efficient and friendly.
The salon is very clean.
I love going here for a relaxing pedicure.

I have tried just about every place in town.
This place is the best.
Best price and pedicure ever.
Super clean and awesome massage.
Do not miss this place.

I just got back from a deluxe pedicure from Cindy at True Nails, my first time there.
My feet look like they have actually had a pedicure, with attention to my calluses and my heels, as opposed to the last 2 places I have visited, and for the same, or less, money.
The salon is very clean, pleasant, and the personnel are friendly.
I will definitely be back here for a great pedi.

I was greeted right away by a very friendly staff.
Even those I was late I got started right away.
I appreciated the little extra time Tina and Hyeu took to make sure my nails were meticulous!
They run a clean shop and do an excellent job!
Thank you Kathy for the humorous chit chat on the side.
I am coming back for certain
