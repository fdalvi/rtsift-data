I love Family Optometry!
I have been going to them for eleven years.
I had to take eye therapy lessons because I had trouble with my peripheral vision when I was in grade school.
I had glasses for many years and now I have eye contacts.
I have Dr. Tsang as my eye doctor.
She's awesome, very knowledgeable and helpful.
Great staff and cute glasses!

I am quite a fan.
I have been going for maybe 13 years with my autistic son.
We have seen Dr. Carr and Dr. Bacon - both are wonderful.
I also have brought my daughters.
Most recently we had an emergency visit because my 7 year old daughter got a scratch on her eye and was in lots of pain.
I was told to bring her right over and Dr. Bacon got her in immediately.
They had no paperwork on her because it had been 6 years since she had an eye exam!
(Only ever did the check at one year old.
)  There was no charge for the visit even though I was told on the phone that just the emergency consult would be $75!
How is that for amazing care?!
I highly recommend this office.

I've been coming to this office for about 8 years now and the people are very friendly and helpful.
I see Dr. Lewis & he always has a funny joke to make the visit fun.
Each of the ladies in the office are very accomodating and they all know me on a first-name basis since I've been coming in all these years!
I had new lenses put in the glasses I've worn since 2007 and they made the transaction go smoothly with doing this.
I will be getting new lenses in my other pair soon as well and am looking forward to this, as my prescription has a slight change to it.
I recommend this office to anyone I know looking for a new eye doctor and optometrist facility!
