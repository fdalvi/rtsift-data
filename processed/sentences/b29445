The teachers at the CSN Nellis campus are very nice and laid back.
The classes are eight weeks long and are not very difficult.

Ok, CSN classes on base is very nice for military.
The instructors are very lenient/understanding of work/TDY's.
The classes are excelled, so it's a lot of work in 8 weeks.
I've taking five classes here now, and enjoyed everyone.
Every instructor has been very nice, and knowledgable.
The only down fall that I've encountered is the a/c sucks in the summer.
Not that every building is like this on base, but all the class rooms are on the third story.
Can put you to sleep.
I recommend this for anyone wanting to get back in school, they really make things easy to get back in the swing of things.

Typical CSN bs.
I really hate this "college"  However, the campus on Nellis is really nice, and it's limited and 8  weeks per course is really great.
