Needs to communicate better.

Worst experience ever, we called to schedule a pick up they said they would be out in the morning around 10 they came late in the afternoon and only came to get a few boxes they told me someone else was coming to get  the rest of out stuff, they never showed over the next few days they said they would come and they never did i left a few messages and never received a call back, i understand that there a FREE pick up service but don't tell people there coming out hen never show, the construction on our office had to get set back because of this, the only thing good about my experience with them was when i was able to get in touch with some one there receptionist lady was very nice.
i would never recommend this company to anyone.

Not sure what all the negative reviews were for.
They were fabulous.
The woman who answered their phone was very helpful and and communicative.
They had to reschedule, but called and gave me plenty of notice.
They showed up on time and were able to take most of what I needed to be hauled away.
For a free service I have absolutely no complaints!!!
Would definitely use them again.
