Kudos to notary Chris who assisted me w/ all smiles and w/o making me feel like I was inconveniencing her (unlike the two notaries AND host at the Laveen branch).
I appreciate the roomy space that emitted positive vibrant energy, yet also made me feel quite at home.

Right on Campus so parking sucks.
I had to use a meter outside and was in and out close to 5pm so I cant complain.

I come in every 2 weeks.
I swear it's a 30 minute wait ever single time.
Always a long line here.

Probably one of the slowest banks I have been to in a Long time.. Let me paint a picture for you: Monday morning rush.
1 merchant teller and 1 regular teller.
Line 8 people deep and not moving.
3 useless "bankers" sitting at their desks with NO clients probably on Facebook.
AVOID this bank if you are in any sort of hurry.
They act like they are doing you a favor when its your money that you are giving them to hold.

Great Location!
Nicest people in the world.
Some of these reviews are hilarious.
We wait in line for movie tickets, for condoms at CVS, for beer at a grocery store but we don't wait for a teller?
USE AN ATM BRO or get direct deposit.
If anything you're holding me up because the bank makes no money off you.
Don't want to wait in line?
Here's a solution: manage your money better.
Stop needing your $500 available today instead of tomorrow.
You're wasting everyones time including your own.
Also, taking a picture in a bank makes you a creeper.100% CREEPER!
