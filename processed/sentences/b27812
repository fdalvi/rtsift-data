What is the point in this new Tesco?
I mean, really, why is it there?
There is a bigger, better, cheaper Tesco literally 1 minute walk further down the road.
A little example: Tabasco in the new Tesco: £1.50.
Tabasco in the old Tesco a minute away £1.44.
Yeah I know it's only 6p, but that's a massive mark up for no particular reason.
And it's rubbish and understocked.
It's horrible, conglomerate, Starbucks-esque monopolisation.
I know we're powerless to stop the inexorable Tesco juggernaut but this little place actually makes me quite angry being there.
Please don't go, for me.

Agreed Neal, this is one of the most pointless stores I have ever seen.
It has barely anything, there are no tills so the queue is huge, and it is just about 300 metres down from one that has served all of Newington pretty well for quite a few years.
Just another example of Tesco taking over the world.

Look, if you need milk, go right ahead, pop in and get some milk.
However, don't expect there to be the exact type of milk that you need and/or want.
Also don't expect the aisles to be clean, the staff to be helpful (they've actually bowled me over on several occasions) or to answer your questions.
The only difference are two girls often servicing the tills, they're quite nice and you're lucky if you get them.
There is however a fat, old, INCREDIBLY slow man who I've seen take 4.25 minutes to tally up 7 items.
No, really, I timed him.
Always, always avoid him and go to self-serve, if they're working.
Or better yet, go to the bigger and better Tesco down the road.
This one's rubbish.
It really is.

Really small, really busy.
Not the cleanest, hard to find stuff I felt , staff was ok I felt like maybe they were understaffed .
