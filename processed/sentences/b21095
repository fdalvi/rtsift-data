I am not a numismatic myself.
If you don't know what that word means, you're probably not one either.
It doesn't refer to some sort of respiratory disorder, nor to an obscure sexual perversion - it's actually the term for someone who collects coins.
Collects them in a deliberate, hobbyish sort of way, I mean, and doesn't just continually accumulate annoying piles of coppers at the bottom of their purse.
Anyway.
If coins are your thing, the Edinburgh Coin Shop is an obvious destination for you.
It's a decidedly old-fashioned shop, with its peeling painted sign, gloomy interior and grime-encrusted windows, but inside is a wealth of small monies, and I get the impression that the people who run it know their stuff, and will be probably be able to answer any coin-related enquiries that you care to throw at them.
