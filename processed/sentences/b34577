Never had an issue with the Filiberto's franchise.
Always decent food, and always open!
This one is on my way to work, sometimes at 4 in the morning!
A good chili verde burritos sounds like a good way to start the day!
In and out of there will fast, haven't ruined a order yet!
Easy place to get in and our of there, located right off of Grand Ave.

Arizona Burrito with Sour Cream.
Period.
Hands down the Best.
Filling & has everything you want in it  !
( value added fun gas too !

I've only been to the drive-thru at this place and always order the menudo on the weekends.
The problem is they always run out by the early afternoon .
so I call them to save an order for me.
They are always cooperative and the menudo is stacked full of tripe.
The broth is perfectly spiced-up.
I cannot understand how they can sell this wonderful dish (actually a quart) for $6 and change including tax.
Spectacular!

Love Filibertos.
Not to be confused with Fredricos or Humbertos or any other os.
Great food.

Food was just OK. Steak burrito was kind of chewy, and my wife's taco salad was good but had barely any lettuce at all.
They were nice about adding more.
I'm not sure if the Air conditioning was broken, or if it is always too hot in there, but it was horribly muggy inside.
