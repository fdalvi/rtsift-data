Had my eyebrows tattooed here, firstly I was messed about with appointments.
Turned up for my original appointment to be told the person doing my treatment was off sick & that I wasn't told because there was no phone number for me yet I had emailed the day before to check the appointment was still okay and no one replied.
I was not offered a patch test and was told on the 2nd appointment that I wouldn't need it and everything would be fine.
I was NOT informed of the possible risks which is highly unprofessional and exceptionally dangerous.
After having the treatment done, my eyebrows healed in 4 days (should take a full week) and after healing they are both different shapes and sizes and almost completely faded!!
I do NOT recommend this salon & although the ladies who work there are lovely I don not feel that they take their work seriously, its only a matter of time before something goes really wrong.

I went here for a tat removal groupon I got.
The place is tiny and not sterile looking.
I asked her what her experience was, her training on the laser machine, and was satisfied enough to let her do a test on me.
Holy cow!
It hurt like crazy.
She did not have any numbing cream or anything, which I would expect a salon to have.
And she was not pleasant, not mean, but not friendly.
I ditched my groupon and decided to go elsewhere for the removal.
Plus, this is really inconveniently located.
