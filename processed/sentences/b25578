It's a Del Taco, so just remember that going in.
You can't really expect anything extraordinary, but this facility is pretty good.
Clean inside, clean and stocked restrooms, and fast service.
They readily get you whatever you need both in the drive through and in person, so it's a quick, pleasant, and crunchy experience.
Would definitely go back.

Overall good food.
I really enjoy the Bacon Double Dell Burger and chicken soft tacos.

not to shabby for some Tuesday night tacos on  especial

Yes, it's fast food.
But if I had a choice between McD's and Del Taco, I would choose Del Taco every time.
They have a special of some sort.
This location is clean and I've always had good service weather it's in the drive thru or inside.
If you are on a tight budget you can eat here for just a few dollars.
Not too shabby.
