On Wednesday, September 19th I contacted Plaza Offices looking for a new office in the Las Vegas area.
I explained that I would not be there until November 1st (because I was traveling abroad) The gentlemen I spoke to Mr. John Harrison was very accommodating.
He checked with the owner Nathan and offered me a host of free office services to presumably earn my business.
We ironed out all the particulars and I was prepared to wire them a security deposit to hold my space.
Less than 24 hours later, I get an email saying the space has been leased.
I called twice both times being told that Mr. Harrison is not in the office.
I left voice mail messages but they went unanswered.
I also emailed Mr. Harrison twice but he could not be bothered to answer me.
I understand if that particular space is not available, but I find it very hard to believe that your entire building was filled to capacity in less than 24 hours time.
Something is off here and I am not sure what.
I wanted people to be aware of my experience, I hope that if you have Dealings with these people that your experience is better than mine was.
Watch out for your cash people!
Who knows what would have happened had I actually sent them money?
Just wanted everyone to be aware and be extremely careful.

Been a customer for about a year and ending our contract ASAP.
We've had multiple billing issues (including reservations made in the middle of the night under [no name] under our account), mail opened on our behalf (seriously?
), and an overall unpleasant experience.
Nathan seems very hot-headed and difficult to deal with.
Would not recommend this place to any of my colleagues for this reason.

The manager of this office is completely rude, EVIL and has terrible customer/client service.
The office receptionist at the front desk are also very rude and unprofessional.
I'm advising everyone to steer clear of this office.
You may loose clients due to their rude, unpleasant management.
Don't bother dropping off a money order at the end of the day... they will treat you like a criminal robber.
You get paid to provide a service for your clients.
You're only hurting yourselves by driving away clients and tenants that are trying to get things accomplished.
