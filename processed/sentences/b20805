Excellent eco-friendly food market with fairly-traded, local, natural, seasonal and organic produce.
Helpful staff too.

Highly recommended for all sorts of fresh produce as well as a good deli range.
Lots of organic, fair trade and local goods, inclucing freshly foraged foodstuffs too!
plus drinks, chocolates, sauces, preserves, fish, meat and veg - plenty of choice - and a nice range of quality cookbooks, to help with making upo a meal.
An on site cafe for a bite to eat, home delivery service available, and great staff inc. one as a regular TV appearence!
makes this one of the best food markets around.

I am definitely a foodie.
The main way to my heart is via my stomach.
A good meal does a great deal for me.
And for any meal, you will need great ingredients.
One option for this is Earthy Food Market, situated on Ratcliffe Terrace in Newington.
This is like a organic farmers' market, but situated in an actual building.
Earthy Foods are going against the grain of the supermarkets by trying to provide a comprehensive range of healthy, organic and locally-produced food and goods.
Wondering into the upstairs food area, your eyes will be drawn in by all the food on offer.
The knowledge that it hasn't travelled for thousands of miles to make it to the shop makes it that bit more appealing.
I particularly enjoyed perusing the meat section, but then I do love my meat!
Also on the premises is the 'yum' cafe, which provides a selection of Fairtrade and organic food and drink.
I really like what they are doing here - it's great to see a place like this trying to break the mould, and succeeding with the support of a number of customers from the local area.
I would love it if Earthy expanded into other premises across the city.
They've definitely got a good thing going on there!

This really is foodie heaven for both shopping to cook at home but also to eat in.
The vegetables and fruit are fresh as they come and it is this produce that makes the delicious soups, salads and sandwiches they have in the cafe.
You can also peruse a selection of recipe books which will inspire you to get cooking with all the hundreds of tasty products on sale in the shop.
Anywhere else I would say it was cynical marketing but having met the owners and many of the staff it's clear that they are just really passionate about good quality food and want you to enjoy it too.
As well as food they also have a wide range of organic and natural toiletries and household products.
Outside they have on sale plants and flowers that brighten up what would otherwise be some decking in a parking lot!
So if it's nice enough to sit outside you should- it's great escapism from the city despite being next to a main road.

Foodie+Earthy=Happy  Actually I don't even really know what a "foodie" is, but apparently they would (and do) really like this place.
I actually can't believe I have never heard of Earthy before!
It's a terrible name but a wonderful place.
I only discovered it while Yelp scouting.
It's not at all far from the centre of town and big too, so it's a surprise its not as well known.
Basically Earthy is a garden centre crossed with an organic grocers crossed with a cafe (called Yum).
It sells small plotted pants, hanging baskets and herbs, most of which are displayed outside.
When you enter Foodie you find a small room to your left which is known as the "quiet room" where you can sit as long as you shut up.
This room can also be booked for your own nefarious (quiet) purposes.
Up a flight of nice wooden stairs you come to the main part of Earthy, a busy little market place style grocers selling all sorts of locally sourced fruit and veg, as well as Scottish dairy and meats.
It's also a sort of delicatessen too!
As you might expect, Earthy can get  a bit pricey.
Given its location its definitely marketed toward the eco-friendly middle class who can afford its organic produce, which unfortunately, remains a privilege.
Unsurprisingly this is also a great place to get your hands on high quality fair trade food like fairtraide fruit that has never touched the ground, 110% cocoa chocolate and coffee that has been specially sealed from creation to never witness sadness.
As mentioned above, Earthy also houses its own cafe "Yum at Earthy Food Market".
Watch out for a separate review on that one (heads up: its good!

If you love Edinburgh's weekly farmer's market, you'll equally love Earthy Foods and Goods.
Especially if you're staying, or live, in South Side.
Actually, if you live in South Side, it'd be a crime not to know of this place's existence.
A lot of the produce you'll find at the farmer's market is available here.
Even though this food store, market garden and cafe is just off a main road, visiting feels like a bit of escapism.
You walk through a winding garden path, into the main building and up some steps to get to the shop.
It's beautifully laid out space that also houses a deli and some seating.
I brought my parents here for lunch a while ago and had some incredible pumpkin-filled ravioli with red and yellow baby tomatoes.
The food is as fresh as it gets and full of flavour.
I'd recommend going just for the experience of wandering through.
It's a feast for the eyes.

I went there today to check out the shop..since the last time I was there they have now got a cafe.
Had an absolutely gorgeous earl grey tea.
Sat at a big wooden table and browsed the numerous cook books they have there.

Like my fellow Yelpers, I love my food and if you want to make a delicious masterpiece, then you really can't scrimp on the quality.
Quality is top on the list at the Earthy Food Market and everything is fresh, and chemical free ensuring that as well as cooking up something tasty, it will also be healthy too.
Unfortunately, being healthy comes at a price and the fruit and veg' here is a bit of a mark up on your Tesco's own range but it does taste 10 times better so something it's worth it, especially if you're cooking a special meal.
In addition to food they also stock cosmetics, soaps and other everyday items all organic, of course.

"You are now 20 steps away from Foodie Heaven.
" As the chalk board at the bottom of the stairs so cheekily but rightly claims (see the photo I uploaded) this place is Foodie Heaven with a capital F and H. And as a true-sworn foodie, I don't say that lightly.
The food here tastes like REAL food.
You can taste every ingredient, all of which are top quality.
Everything on offer sounds too tempting and it's all just sooo gooooood.
It's also all organic, locally sourced, and therefore healthier, and all that other good, green stuff so it's basically top notch, good-for-you goodness.
What more could you ask for?
I came here for brunch and opted for the bacon roll.
Plain you might say, but I had plans to order more food later so this was saving room.
The roll was beautifully soft, the bacon crispy and flavourful.
My friend had a mix of all the veggies on offer that included roasted sweet potato, brocolli (which she claims was the best brocolli EVER), salad and cous cous.
Not much more to say except DELICIOUS.
After two cups of tea and lots of chat later, we then ordered a home-made sausage roll to share.
"Sausage roll" sadly immediately makes me think of Greggs and their greasy, fatty and tasteless offerings.
But cast that image from your mind and replace it with a sausage roll the size of your face, oven baked and golden brown, stuffed full of real sausage meat, mustard, oregano and served with a side of chickpeas in a delicious red pesto dressing.
The result was 5 minutes of near-silence and glazed eyes as my friends and I had lunch (brunch round 2 if you will) and long drawn out "oooohhhhmygod"s. Earthy, my tastebuds thank you.
I was actually sad I didn't have room for the: plum sponge, pecan pie, bacon and french toast with maple syrup, and porridge with apple and plum compote.
I wanted it all.
I also spent a large majority of my time looking at all the amazing food, teas, and produce for sale in the shop.
The deli cafe is up the stairs, at the back of the store so you (rather cleverly) need to walk past all the food in the shop to get to the cafe.
They stock every type of organic brand, home-made, locally sourced Scottish produce you can think of, and there is a huge selection.
Most organic or local-Scottish produce stores are quite small, but Earthy is really quite huge, the staff are all really friendly and know what they're talking about from the range of cheeses to the pickles and jams.
This is probably too long-winded a review but Earthy deserves these extra pixels.
Earthy is now my favourite place for Sunday brunch, Wednesday lunch, anytime coffee and cake.
FACT.

I'm knocking down the stars by two wholly because of the customer service.
The food here is exceptional, without a doubt, and wonderful for coffee and cake time, brunch time, lunch time.
But would service with a smile really kill them?
It's pricey, and slightly out of the way, so is always a 'treat' to come here.
The past three times I've come, two seperate members of staff have given me the stare of "why are you disturbing me from cooking?
" when I've asked to place an order, and literally haven't smiled once in the whole ordering, delivery, and paying process.
The first time I let it go, but it's becoming consistent enough now to actually put me off going.
It really did make my almond croissant taste a little more bitter.

Since my previous review, Earthy have in fact been in touch to apologise for the slightly off-service I've experienced.
I have to say this level of customer service and focus on feedback definitely warms me to them again.
The food has always been great, the only thing I was a bit put-off by was unfriendly service but since that has now been actively remedied I am once again a full-on Earthy fan.
I haven't actually been back since they've been in touch, but I will update again for my return visit.
Other cafes take note, this is how to keep customers coming back!

And I'm back on board!
I've written a few reviews of Earthy and always been glowing in my praise of the food.
At times I found certain staff to be a little cold, and had one or two bad occasions.
Especially when the girl actually forgot my order directly after taking it, despite that I was the only customer.
Um, anyway.
Also, they could do with making it warmer (somehow) inside as I've had to eat my soup with coat and scarf still on a few times.
Buuuuttt butbutbut I really just can't get past how great the food is.
Seriously.
I have been out of action recently with a sore leg and haven't been able to walk longer than 2 minutes at a time.
But when a friend came for lunch I walked to Earthy, despite the injury and subsequent pain.
It's that good.
The menu changes daily, as do the sandwich and salad options.
But I always go for the salad platter.
How do they get the aubergines so soft?
And the sweet potato so...amazing?
It's just the wonderful combination of fresh vegetables, organically grown, with little touches like Nigella seeds or pumpkin and walnut flourishes to make the salad really memorable.
And I could eat a whole vat of the chickpeas.
But the still-warm icing on the cake was, in fact, the maramalde cake.
Despite being full from my salad platter I gave into temptation and had the first slice of a freshly baked maramalde cake.
And good lord that slice was big.
Door stop big.
And good lord that cake was good.
I originally cut it in half to take half home for later, but then ate it all.
Perfect with a cup of the Artisan coffee too.
Ok I'm going on and on.
But as far as cake experiences go, it was the best one I've had in 2011 so far.
Seriously.
I get so disappointed when I go out for cake and tea and it's a non-descript affair that could be duplicated anywhere.
Not at Earthy.
This is a one-off gem that I would gladly limp to time and time again.
I am in food-love.

This is the sort of place I would like to love but there's something I can't quite connect with.
Great stock of organic food, nice atmosphere, cafe if you want it, friendly staff ... maybe it's the prices that put me off??

Nice, environmentally friendly, cafe, market, food establishment.
Can be a little on the pricey side, but good quality.

Jeez louise, I'd definitely left a visit to Earthy too long.
Last time I was here the café was upstairs, and downstairs had some seating with sofas and the like.
That must have been at least a year ago.
No idea why, since it's definitely one of my favourite cafés in the area and the food is just a cut above the rest.
But since then, the downstairs now has the café complete with lots more seating.
If it was wonderful already, it's simply spectacular now.
Apart from the actual lay out, nothing has changed since my previous review: in a nutshell, that the food is just out-of-this-world good.
A vegetarian, or even raw foodies, heaven there are so many fresh veggie dishes that have been made with the freshest, most locally farmed veg.
You can really taste the difference (sorry Sainbury's, yours is just smoke and mirrors).
Then there's the quiches.
And the sandwiches.
It's hard to put into words just how *good* the food is, or how different it is to other café fare.
It just *is*.
Admittedlly, that top notch quality comes with a top notch price tag.
I wouldn't be able to come here daily for my lunch.
It's definitely a special treat.
But trust me, it's worth it.
Upstairs they have their food market too which is just fantastic.
Also pricey, but a mecca of all things delicious and foodie.
"Foodie heaven" it used to say on the wall, and couldn't be closer to the truth.
Fresh fruit and veg, meat, pickles, desserts, chocolate, snacks, all sorts of ingredients for cooking, alcohol, fresh cheese.
All too good.
So now I've been back after my year-long delay, and seen the much comfier café downstairs, I really don't have an excuse not to go back...a lot.
Yey!

I like Earthy... more than I would like to admit.
I like that they have locally grown fruit and veg, tasty breads, cool flours, and loads of other funky things (like whole tubes of black pudding!
) that I like to buy.
It also has a parking lot which is ironic, but very convenient.
They also have a good selection of local and organic beers and wines which always catch my eye when we pass.
I absolutely indulge my inner hippy here and The Man and I had a giggle last time we were here because we were wellied out and on our way to bag up horse manure for the garden.
I also got excited about being able to refill my Ecover here.
Ecover is expensive but doesn't wreck my skin like Fairy does, so we buy it.
I was keen on the idea of refilling our bottle for cheaper than it costs to buy a new one, except.... except that it's more expensive to refill your bottle at Earthy than it is to buy a new one at Tesco.
How does that work?
Stars also lost because about 1/3 of the onions we bought there had to be thrown out due to being pretty badly rotted.
I realise they're all natural and organic but if you're going to pay that much for onions, you really don't want to throw a bunch of them out.
So I like Earthy and, if for no other reason, I'll totally keep coming here to buy lots of Stornoway black pudding, tasty breads, tasty flours, etc.
I'll stick to Tesco for my Ecover and onions, though.

It was difficult to review this place, but I shall conclude prior to actually explaining why, by saying my experience here was rather mediocre.
Earthy food market is very close to my flat in Causewayside, and I was surprised to find it (in a positive way).
I love cafes/shops which serve ethical, delicious food.
On first appearances, it reminded me of wholefoods market.
What seems to have once been a garage is now rustic inside, the ground floor being the premises for the cafe, the upstairs an upmarket grocery store.
I have been up to the shop upstairs on various occasions.
The vegetable selection looks incredible, with plenty of delicious looking organic veggies on offer.
The price tag is quite shocking though.
I was tempted by the reduced miso paste, which cost £3.90 reduced from around £5.
Good thing I didn't buy it.
I found it at full price at the new leaf health food shop the next day, for £2.99.
The tofu here is also overly priced, as are just about all the products available.
The only slightly cheaper thing I have found here are the lazy day vegan/gluten free tiffin and millionaire's shortbread, which are 30p cheaper than those found in Henderson's and Real foods.
The fresh bakery products do look very impressive, and I would definitely try them if I could eat gluten.
It's sad, as the shop has quite a bit of potential, I just feel that it loses it by exciting people with luxury range goods in a rustic setting and overcharging for them.
In case you haven't noticed by my other reviews, I am quite conscious of sneaky marketing techniques.
This place screams "spend money here if you care about the environment and have class".
Today I tried out the cafe downstairs for the first time, but just for a coffee.
The food on display looked very good, plenty of interesting salads with lots of Mediterranean and middle eastern flavours such as feta, marinated aubergines and fennel, but the prices were not that honest.
The cakes looked good likewise, but the prices were unjustified.
I guess the only justification is that people will spend money there, as many people think expensive equates to good quality, which I don't think is true.
I ordered a soya cappuccino.
It was £2.75...
I pay £2.20 in Brew lab, which was pricy in itself, but more akin to standard British prices.
The coffee arrived, it was pretty with coffee art on top, which one would expect from a place like this.
It was nice enough, a bit strong, and a bit on the large size.
No complaints really except for the price.
The staff were friendly, the options numerous but really nothing really to write home about.
I don't think I'll bother returning to the cafe, though I will use earthy as my lazy days supplier.

Not only do they do a fantastic selection of locally grown produce, fresh baked goods, plants, holistic household items, and gardening supplies, they have meat and game for sale and recently installed a butcher upstairs and have extended the café downstairs.Wholesome salads, quiches, interesting sandwiches and an array of teas and coffees make this a café/shop worth the trip out to EH9.
We sat outside in the sunshine enjoying a fantastic platter of marinated lamb, cheeses, Baba Ganoush, Hummous, Salads, peas and new potatoes.
It came with freshly baked flatbreads and crispy crackers too.
Even though we consumed large amounts of food I still felt rather virtuous and healthy as it was all so fresh and tasty.
Our friend had a Beetroot and Goats cheese tart which was also amazing and very reasonable at £7.95.
The platter retails at £12.95 and was more than enough for two.
Despite the extensive and fantastic cake selection we opted for strawberries and fresh cream with a brownie on the side of course!
The brownie was perfectly gooey and lovely, yum.
All in all a wonderful lunch and a great shop!
Earthy watch out - when I move to Newington next week you will be sick of the sight of me!

Had a lovely flat white and bacon roll here this morning.
Service was really friendly too.
I went into the new back yard where they have lots of plants, most which are perennials, which is fantastic as you tend to get your monies worth!
Really good range of plants and some of which I've not seen before too.
Do go& have a peak, even if you haven't got a garden.
Bacon roll was good.
Nice roll, tasty bacon too, BUT hold on, there was more bacon needed for the size of the roll and the £3.50 I paid.
Coffee was Matthew Algie.
It was nice, strong and my usual choice of flat white!

I'm done with Earthy!!
and that's a shame, I want to like it, cos the food is tasty and the parking is a dream, but it's a rip-off, the portions do vary, but again today it was a joke!.
almost £10.00 for quiche and THe tiniest salad on the planet!
I paid an extra £1.00 to change the coleslaw it came with for something else, (ermm why?
) anyway I opted for  pasta and grilled courgette, and there was one  slice of courgette, ONE .!?
It also came with baby spinach leaves, I thought they had forgotten to put this on, but no..the 6 little leaves were hiding under the weeny pile of pasta..
It's also freezing cold, and really rather unfriendly.. so that's it I'm done, life is too short to be disappointed by a  courgette!

Brilliant place.
Love the layout.
I've been going for years.
One can have a wee meal whilst shopping.
An believe me it is so easy to stop shopping and tuck into the food on offer.
Especially after seeing it on shelves and coolers.
I then want a meal made with all the ingredients on sale.
The staff are devine and helpful and most of all give me space to just look and browse.
All the wood and lovely smells make it a lovely place to walk around in.
Such a variety of prices, so even when I only have a bob or two I can still indulge.
Thankyou Earthy!!

Earthy seems to be the perfect blend of healthy, hip, cool, laid back, socially conscious eating and shopping.
They have 3 locations; been to 2: Cannonmills and Causewayside (other is in Portobello).
The Cannonmills site is closer and  has a small but well stocked shop of fresh organic fruit and veg, packaged good and my favourite new food of the year - IQ Chocolate (made in Stirling).
It also has a casual dining area with amazing salads and lovely brunch.
I have only just discovered Earthy Causewayside and it is an absolute treasure!!
Its a bit out of the way (for me) but that means they were able to get a bigger building with parking and outside space.
The downstairs is the cafe but this is counter service only - and no evenings.
The salads are varied, healthy, delicious and inspiring - I would love to recreate the sweet potato salad at home!
And I had the creamiest richest Chai latte (for some reason they add a shot of coffee - but they warn you of this and can request it to be coffee free - which I do).
The whole upstairs is the shop.
It is a joy to wander around - with beautifully presented  fruit and veg, a great selection of organic packaged goods - many of which are locally produced (such as the aforementioned IQ chocolate...).
The most amazing part has to be the outdoor eating in the rear - only open in the summer.
It appears that when they took over the building the yard was a dumping ground.
Well instead of sending it all to the skip - it has been recycled and reinvented into tables, seating areas, planting vessels - you name it - they created it!
The seating has been divided into private little havens - which can be reserved!!
All in all a visit to Earthy Causewayside is a little adventure - discovering quirky spaces and delectable treats to eat in and take away.
