Fantastic service!
Totally trust worthy mechanics who ensure your vehicle is properly fixed before you drive it out of the shop.
Customers leaving satisfied and willing to refer their friends to Maximum Auto & Body  Repair is their top priority.

These assholes "replaced my number " because they couldn't fix the left clip holding it in .
Waited a week for my car only to find the clip had just been fixed and the stole my cell phone charger .
No I didn't take it out I never take it out and they still had the balls to charge me for a new bumper

Came here to get a quote on a paint job for our black 96 Integra GSR.
Fantastic work on all the cars on the lot, you can tell this place is top notch.
