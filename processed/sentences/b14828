I hate to have to review on this as these things are sort of private but whatever.
We used these guys about a year ago.
Having papers served is  pretty private matter for most, but I'll review on it anyways.
They are not $20 for one thing, more like $75 and up.
Also, they constantly hounded me for payment even after my check was cashed.
Hounded in a thug sort of way.
It took a lot of explaining and I had to mail them the cancelled check for them to understand I had paid them which was a little ridiculous.
However, they did get the paper served.

Don't bother with these folks.
I called them because they came up as $20 on a google search.
But when I called them, they said it would be $75 even though our tenant was right down the street from them.
When I asked about the $20, they said that was just their name, not their price.
What a rip!
I told them I thought that was misleading and false advertising and hung up.
I found a process server who did the job for $50.

This company is unprofessional and will not return calls even when they promise they will.
The seem very disorganized and my client may have to now reset her hearing because documents have yet to be confirmed served.
No one can give you an answer as they say they have to "check with the process server".
The process server must be on vacation as it has been over 1 week and I still have no answer.
As a legal professional , if I handled my clients this way I would be out of business.
I am sorry I did not see these reviews prior to hiring this horrible company.

Horrible Choice to make when it comes to speed, efficiency, and communication, which is what you need to serve important papers to someone.
They told me my family law papers would be served the next day so I paid and got no phone calls at the end of the day as promised, the BITCH on the phone called me a liar and copped a lot of attitude over the phone.
3 DAYS LATER THEY STILL DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW MANY ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE!!!!!!!
You will feel like a sucker if you go with these ASSHOLES.
Please, do yourself a favor and search for a REAL process serving company WITH better rates.
NO $20 SERVING!
BS!

WORST service i have ever had in my life.
I have used several servers before and this was a terrible experience.
I gave then dates times and pictures of the person and tons of detail to make this an easy job.
After 2 weeks and about 10 phone calls never returned I finally got a new person on the phone and screamed because court was the following day.
They finally decided to serve the person a day before court.
AND they never filled the papers with the court to this day - DO NOT USE oh and it was not $20 try $60

I ONLY give this place 1 star because I had to!
DO NOT use this place EVER!
It has been 3 weeks since I hand delivered my family court papers to have them served!
After 5 phone calls and being promised phone calls back (NEVER GOT A SINGLE CALL BACK), I called and refused to end the call until they got me an answer!
Nobody there has any clue about what is going on!
HORRIBLE experience!
Court is 10 days away!!!
After being in the phone demanding answers I finally was angry enough to hang up on these clueless and unprofessional people!
I would have gladly paid triple just for a company who knows what is going on and knows how to communicate!!!
STAY AWAY from this place!!
