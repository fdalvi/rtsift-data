Mr. Handyman's business model is smart.
They are excellent in customer service, especially with answering calls and scheduling.
Much better than some of their competitors.
Their handiman, (who has come by twice) does do great work and there's little to no flaws in that.
The only reason this isn't higher, is they do charge per hour and try to book appointments that last more than 2-3 hours.
Our handiman was a little condescending as well.
I may still call on them because they actually respond and do very good work.
(this includes dry wall, fan installation, basic plumbing, etc...)

Fantastic experience.
Fair rates.
Great people.

I had him bid something for me and not thorough in looking at the job and the price was high
