I have bought my last five or so pair of running shoes from this store, and I'm always pleased with how helpful and knowledgeable their staff is.
Have yet to be disappointed in the service or the quality of shoes.

Pretty Empty place, but had a good deal on chairs for tailgate season.

Got good deals on low back lawn charirs here of all places!?!?
We found them by searching high and low by the beach equipment.
We asked a worker when we first got in if they had them, and within seconds, his answer was flat out no, rather than helping us find other possible spots where they might be.
Yeah, service here kinda sucks...
They also carry sporting goods for just about every sport and fitness freak here.
and this store is huge.
One odd thing is that there seems to be more employees on the floor than there are customers!?!?
Don't really know how this place is still open when there are there are much better sporting goods shops in town...ALOHA!!

Came here a few times before and was quite frankly not impressed.
The store is a little outdated.
For such a large store they really don't have that many employees on staff.
I waited in the sneaker isle for help for ten minutes and nobody came over to assist me.
However the store does have a nice variety and selection which makes up for the lack of assistance.
I would most likely return just because of its proximity to my house, other than that nothing else really wowed me about this store.

The employees were nice, but the store seemed SO empty!
They really don't have a lot of product at all, and their disc golf selection...while better than Sports Chalet's was this weekend, was pretty dismal.
They seem to have more clothing than actual sporting equipment.
Not a fan.
I don't plan to return.
