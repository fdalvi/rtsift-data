This is DEF a gallery not to be missed!

This place is amazing.
It has its own vibe that draws just the right crowd of misfit artists.
You wont find a better place to spend an evening among art and artists.

Love it here!
Always unique and slightly dark art.
Definitely a go see if you are in phoenix~

this place is the best of the best of modern, macabre, alternative, dark, creepy, sexy, and beautifully put together in a wonderful little cove on 5th street, right off of Roosevelt.
Perfect location.
Friendly and passionate artists.
Priceless art of all kinds.
BUY BUY BUY!
