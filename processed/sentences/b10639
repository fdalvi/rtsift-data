purchased my fiancee a purse here and she purchased a wallet for me.
I do not remember the salesman name but was very nice and friendly and acted how all salesman should act.
We have been back here a couple times and all the salesman and saleswomen were very friendly.

Service, service, service...  a suitcase in the window caught my eye, the hubby and I walked in and drooled over it.
The salesgirl was super friendly and explained the different colors they had in that style.
She was not pushy or snooty or anything of the sort.
We decided not to buy anything and she was still super nice.
Good job, when I will the jackpot I'll be back to buy the beautiful suitcase!

Visiting some amazing artwork I mean works of art others may call a handbag or a purse.
One day  I adopt one and take it home with me.
Until then i will visit  cherish and day dream of this coming true.
