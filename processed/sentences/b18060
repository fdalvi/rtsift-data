Pierre, you've said everything there is to say about this.
I can't wait to see it bulldozed.
Any day now.

Uh, it's definitely an eye sore.
Not to mention that all the construction tape and fences make the nearly impossible to find underground parking that much more difficult.
Whew.
I'm just glad I survived my trip downtown, managed to locate the entrance to the parking garage and handed over $4 for an hour + of my time that I'll never get back.
And for those of you looking for visitor parking, it's at the corner of Washington and 1st Ave (not Central, as I was told).
Good luck!
