nice friendly knowledgable staff!!!!
i left my wheels there and like an hour later they called and said they were ready.
competitive pricing and he even took them to my car.
i will definitely get my bike tires here next time too!!!!
thanks guys.

Pretty straight foward, I like the fact that I can ride up to the back and walk right in then ride right out.
I dont have some HD salesman to deal with behind a counter, and well, these guys been changing wheels and thats what they do.
So like, I liked it.
They also found my back brakes to be low.
Changed them  too.
Not bad.
Price, may have been a little bit on the up side, but I cant be sure as I am not motorcycle tire replacement and oh hey we found your rear brakes bad so lets change them pricing expert.

Worst service.
Two hours for a tire change them when nearly commpleat they take brake for 30 min.
I'm the only customer waiting.
NO CUSTOMER SERVICE Lunch is more important
