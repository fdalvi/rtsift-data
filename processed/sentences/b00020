The outdoor sand volleyball courts are nice, and there is an outdoor bar area for spectators, celebrating a win, or drowning your sorrows after a loss.
There is also a playground right there which is nice for people that bring their kids along.
The outdoor soccer field looks nice, but they don't have a scoreboard, so you can't tell how much time is left in the game or keep track of the score.
The facility seems well kept, and the staff has been very nice.
If you have a serious team and are competitive, Keva is a great place to play sports.
If you are looking for something more laid back and social, there are plenty of nice bar leagues around which may be a better fit.

keva is a large sports complex with indoor and outdoor soccer, volleyball and basketball courts.
it is hands down the nicest facility i've played volleyball at in the madison area.
it would get more stars from me if it weren't for a few things:   1. their leagues are much more expensive than others in the area (and the seasons are shorter as well).
pooley's and mscr don't have the same facilities, but their seasons are longer.
2. it's in the middle of nowhere.
the location is only convenient if you live in Middleton or on the far west side.
driving there from anywhere else suuuucks, especially in the winter.
3. it is always cold in there.
if they're going to charge what they do for leagues, the least they could do is turn the heat up a bit, or do something with their insulation.

My wife and I have played in the volleyball leagues (sand and indoor) and our kids do some of the kids programming.
Facility is very nice and great atmosphere.
Instructors have all been really nice and referees do there best, but very nice.
:) Only reason I have it 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the high costs.
As someone else said in their review, it is more expensive and sessions are shorter.
But overall,  very good.
