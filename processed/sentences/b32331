My puppy was bloated and I brought him here to see what was wrong with him.
They ran some tests and never called me back with the results.
The bloating went down the next day but I feel like if I am paying over $100 for tests the least you can do is call me back with the results.

My puppy was sick again and the only reason why I came back is because the hours of operation here work with my schedule.
The people here really have no idea what they are doing.
Based on my dog's symptoms I was able to go online and figure out what was wrong with him but I'm not a doctor and I needed a professional to diagnose him and give him the proper care he needed.
They said they couldn't figure out what was wrong with him and gave him antibiotics.
Turns out my puppy had kidney stones and was in a lot of pain.
I took him to another doctor who was able to figure out what was wrong with him right away.
If you care for your animal do not come here.

We just took our puppy Rico to this vet because he had been having blood in his poop for a few weeks.
This was the second vet we took him the first vet told us he had worms and it would just go away, but he was still sick.
We came to this palce because they are open late we got there right before close but Dr Forrest still made time to see us.
She ran a bunch of tests and told us that poor Rico had a disease called geardia all along and needed special medication to go home with.
Rico got better and we ended up going back and signing up to the health plan there for all his shots.
WE really like this vet and will be going back to see Dr Forrest.

I visited Banfield with a sick dog.
He belonged to my Dad and I am not real familiar with how vets work.
The people here were wonderful.
They were warm and gracious, it was a stressful situation made better by the kind women that work there.
The Vet was so positive and has a really funny grin!!!
All in all, I would definitely recommend this location to anyone looking!
