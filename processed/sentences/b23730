Pricey but love this place.
Their denim from Craft are the softest I have ever felt.
I would never buy another gap jacket for my daughter again.
A little far for me to drive so I don't get there much but I definitely make the effort every now and then.
Too bad we don't have any high end clothing in the SE valley.
I need an escape from the Justice for girls junk.

If you are looking for cute kids clothes, this is the place!
The key is to only buy on sale...then you get cute without blowing your budget!
Staff are friendly and helpful!

The clothing they sell is wonderful and as a previous poster mentioned the key is to buy it on sale.
I have to say the retail experience at this store in no way matches the quality of the merchandise.
On a recent visit, this grandfather was relieved of his Peek shopping bag brought in to get a benefit of sale reduction.
"So that my hands are free to shop" I was told..  Do you try that with women's handbags and briefcases?
I think not.
Very bad form   You're implying that your customer is a thief after having spent handsomely.
They refused the credit since I was a few days late to which I had to tell them I'd return the goods then buy them again at the sale price.
Then I got the benefit of sale.
They practice data mining by asking for your name at the beginning of each sale ?
Why bother ?
Declining only makes people feel uncomfortable.
Petty retail practices and poor customer relations.

I was so excited to have a new kids store in town.
Very cute clothing but due to inconsistent quality and sizing it makes it hard to continue to shop here.
I bought a wrap dress for my daughter and after only a few washes it had multiple holes on the seams.
The salesperson states it's thin material so it doesn't last long- Really??
My son's very cute block shirt had the cotton pilling after only 1 wash.
I mentioned this to the salesperson at the Kierland Commons location and she stated since they have only been in business 6 years they are still having issues with their venders.
