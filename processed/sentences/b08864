After a day of golfing, I needed some post sun relief....so I stopped by here to pick up a bottle of Banana Boat After-Sun Lotion.
The store is clean and well organized, I was able to find what I was looking for very quickly.

It's a pharmacy with a grocery store.
It's a grocery store with a pharmacy.
Which is it!?
In a pinch, CVS was a great place to stop for some ice cold drinks and sunscreen to avoid a search all over a larger store like Safeway.
After all, it is Scottsdale and you have to have the basics without spending 30 minutes dodging soccer moms and retirees.
The prices seemed decent and the nice little checker was very nice.
It was just kind of depressing in there.
My recommendation, get a perscription for anti-depressants for pickup so that you have something to pick you up after your visit.

The store is clean.
This is the worst pharmacy I have ever used.
The pharmacy just down the street at Scottsdale Rd & Shea is the one to use.
Every time I have gone to this pharmacy the service has been terrible.
I have had to wait at the drive thru for 20 minutes just with me already at the window.
90% of the time they do not have the medication in and have to order it.
The people at the pharmacy are not helpful and seem overworked..

I was in a bind and really needed some "emergency" toiletries and thankfully our dinner plans were located right next to CVS Pharmacy.
We don't have CVS where I live and thought the selection of items was really super.
I got my "emergency" toiletries and proceeded to buy huge amounts of make-up wipes.
I don't know why, but I have a horrible compulsion to purchase anything that's BOGO at 50% off!
I went up to the counter to purchase my items but no one was at the cashier stand.
I looked around and thought "Uh is no one working?
" I guess the cashier had gone to the bathroom, but regardless it was all very odd.
The cashier came back and checked out my items.
She was nice enough to scan a CVS card to activate the discount for my bulk make-up wipes, so I have to give her kudos for that.
Thanks CVS for helping a girl in her moment of need!

I have never had a good experience with the pharmacy here -- long wait, short staffed, complaining, takes hours for a prescription..... No thank you!
There is another CVS open across the road (NE Scottsdale/ Shea) that has a better pharmacy and is 24 hours....
This store is newer, decently stocked, and the CVS front desk staff are nice.
However, if you are looking for a quick pop-in somewhere, circle K across the street may be a better option.

We had just gotten into town and went looking for supplies that we didn't pack (sunscreen, etc.
) and found everything we needed in here.
We took a friends suggestion and bought a collapsible cooler to fill up with ice (at the hotel) and put some waters in for when we were out driving.
Life saver!
Saved money!
We bought a 24pk of water for like $3!!!
Lasted us through our entire trip.
I can't vouch for the place if you need a prescription but if you need supplies and some drinks and snacks then you can't go wrong here.

Loved this place, used to come here all the time when it's open 24/7, now the store closes at 10pm and I had to go to the one at Scottsdale Rd.
& Shea Blvd.
for the 24-hour store.
Great selections of products you need and they also accept coupons which is a big plus for me.
Easy access from anywhere in Phoenix.
Great location and friendly staff.

I don't think I have ever met a group of employees who collectively hate their jobs as much as this pharmacy crew.
It doesn't matter the day, every interaction for the past 6 months has been appalling here.
Its sad that it's taken me 6 months to finally call it quits!
The only reason I continued to go here is because of it being down the street from my office.
The staff, including the pharmacists are rude and inconvenienced by any questions you ask.
Including the wait time or questions regarding prescription information.
I could go on for days about each and every one of these people but its a waste of time for my thumbs.
I'd much rather drive to another pharmacy to deal with more pleasant people who actually enjoy their job and are thankful to have you in their store spending money.
I'm not saying kiss my a$$ or anything, just maybe be helpful and do your job, like answer simple questions without it being as though it's the end of the world and someone took another dump in your Cheerios

Looking through the reviews, I realize I am not alone.
My collective experiences at this pharmacy consist of waiting, waiting some more reaching the window them telling me my insurance isn't updated and that i should just come back because they are too busy to deal with it immediately oh and that i should call my insurance and figure it out..... Another time i had went through the drive through at 9:45pm and the lady behind the window was clearly annoyed and told me not to come this late in the future as they are beginning to shut their computers down.
Another time i was blocked in the drive through lane ended up waiting for 40 mins!
and when i reached the window my prescriptions weren't even ready!
The staff is rude, constantly make you feel as if you are an inconvenience, and have no appreciation for your time.
I high suggest getting your meds elsewhere.
