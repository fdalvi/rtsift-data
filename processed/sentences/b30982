Mark is incredible, and was the best choice when it came to getting a property manager.
He seriously did everything!
Got the renters, got their deposits, drafted forms, filed licenses, showed the property, listed it for sale to investors, and as requested, sold it for us!!
We are so incredibly happy to have met him and had the opportunity to work with him.
The website is great and the auto-deposit of rent is flawless.
He's incredibly flexible and patient, and never gave us any headache whatsoever (despite the complexity of our situation).
Great guy, wonderful manager, and I'm proud to now call him a friend.
Thanks, Mark!!

It takes a lot to make me want to go home on a Friday evening and write a negative review on Yelp about a property manager....   What a terrible experience I just had with Mark Brower.
Set an appointment to view a property 3 days in advance.
Confirmed the appointment the day before.
20 minutes before my appointment Mark called to let me know he was double booked and could not make it, but would send the lock box code if I sent a picture of my license... which I did immediately after I hung up the phone.
My fianc√© and I stood outside the property for 15 minutes waiting for the text with the lockbox code... nothing.
Called Mark 3 times.... nothing.
Finally decided to just go home.
Mark called an hour later to apologize because he was on the phone with a client.
He then text me the lockbox code.
After debating if we should even look at the house, we decided to go back over and see it and give Mark the benefit of the doubt... NOPE, wrong lock box code.
Thanks for wasting our time.
Now, back to enjoying my weekend!

They are the most caring, thoughtful, and helpful group of people that work well together, willing to help any customers for any types of need in any situations.
I really highly recommend them.
