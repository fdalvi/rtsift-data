As they are cooking everything it smells really good.
They even had a plate of sample pretzels bits out that were nice and warm.
The girl working behind the counter was sweet.
She told me they had a special on hot dog rolls, 2 for $5.00.
However, i asked for 2 Jalapeno rolls and she said they were still cooking.
I said OK, i will be back in about 5 min.
When i came back again i ordered 2 jalapeno rolls.
She gave me my order and a coupon for next time.
But, when i got where i was going and opened the bag i had 2 plain hot dog rolls.
I did not take them back really it is not a big thing.
But, it would have been nice.
Since i like the spicy.
Other than that ,fabulous!

So, so, so good!
This is my favorite place to get a pretzel.
Warm, buttery and delicious.
I try not to think about how many calories must be in these things for them to taste that good, but I think we all know a pretzel isn't health food.
If you're going to have one, why not have a good one?
I have tried a few of their different flavors.
they have all been good, but I always just end up going back to the original because it's just soft, warm, and yummy.
There is also a Wetzel's Pretzels in the mall.
They are good too, but I prefer Auntie Anne's.
They taste a bit fresher to me.
Go try one.

Damn these pretzels are irresistible.
They are expensive but completely worth it.
Every product they offer is delicious and addicting.
Those calories add up quick though so be careful.
