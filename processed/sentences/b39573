Good points: The store is open 24 hours from Monday morning through to 10pm on Saturday nightthere are really good bargains on selected food and drink (Try getting two bottles of Dentyl mouthwash for Â£2.50 anywhere)...It is a big store so you can pretty much get everything you need all under one roof.
Bad points: QUEUES!
There are always horrendous queues no matter what time of day or night you are there.
I've shopped at 1am and at 3pm during the week and you have to wait for agesthen there is the issue of products or deals not coming up correctly at the till point, which you sometimes don't realise until after you've paid, in which case you then have to queue AGAIN at the customer service counter.
I've filled in the customer service complaint log so many times in the past and you never get any sort of follow-up from it.
Cheap products - yes.
But the whole shopping experience is just so stressful so now I don't bother going.
