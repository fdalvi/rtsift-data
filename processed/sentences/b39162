This is a wonderful little bookshop.
They honestly don't make ones like this place anymore.
I heard about this place through the grapevine and, when I was in Trader Joe's, I decided to stop in.
I browsed for a while and Joanne, the owner, was extremely wonderful and asked if I needed help with anything.
I definitely will be back here...I could get lost for hours!!

Say goodbye to big box impersonal bookstores and hello to an enjoyable unique experience!
Great selection and if they don't have it they'll try and find it for you.
Plus, they have an interesting selection of monthly events.
A definite place to stop after my Trader Joe's run across the street and before hitting the local coffee shop for a relaxing read with a cardamom latte.

We were in town for a family baby shower/visit/therapeutic Madison fix (I love this place) and stopped by to check on the odd chance that a specific children's book may possibly be available in some way, as it was part of a planned gift.
We had searched and searched with no results in other places.
The woman at Mystery to Me was great: she sourced the book through a vendor of used items, expedited the order, and thoughtfully prolinted out a photo of the book's cover so that my sister could present the "en route" item to my daughter...,  We found some mystery books we had wanted and chatted about how much people like the new JK Rowling mystery book which was published under a pseudonym.
The shop is beautiful with many great items to choose from.
We received recommendations and ideas about books to read in the future.
I enjoyed discovering one more Madison happy place on Monroe!

Stopped in to sell Girl Scout cookies and ended up staying for 6 authors as they did a book slam.
My girls (6 and 8) were totally enthralled (as was I).
The setting is warm, intimate and inviting.
Of course my daughter wanted to buy every book in the place!!

We need more places like this store.
