I went to this particular urgent care with my son (18 months) and daughter (4 months) because both were having respiratory problems and their pediatrician wasn't available today.
It took about 20-25 minutes to be called back.
The appointment was approx 40 minutes long.
The doctor (Scott Connley, MD) was a nice person, but didn't seem to know what he was doing.
He asked me what they did for my son the last time and then hmmm and hawed about the previous treatment.
After doing NOTHING (no meds or treatments) for them he billed my insurance $85 EACH to tell me that my children have upper respiratory infections and that we should "follow up" with their normal pediatrician.
The reason that I went here was because the pediatrician wasn't available.
What a waste of time and a perfect example of why medical insurance is overpriced.
As of now my children are no better than they were before going, if anything they have gotten worse.
I would NOT recommend this place to anyone as there are two other urgent care facilities within walking distance from this one.

I took my 8 month old son in here because our regular ped.
could not fit him in.
He had a 103 temp.
and I was told by our ped.
office to take him to Urgent Care.
When we met with the doctor he made both me and my husband feel as though we were complete idiots for thinking that having a fever was a bad thing.
I know that fevers are not always bad, however, when a young child is spiking a fever and shaking and cannot stop, it is cause for worry as a parent.
He told us that IF EVERY BABY IN TOWN GOT A FEVER AND THEIR BRAIN BOILED (as if this is what I was thinking) THAT ALL BABIES AROUND HERE WOULD BE RETARDED.
Talk about unprofessional and rude.
I was completely disgusted at his attitude toward the health of my child and his idiotic response.
I payed $115 dollars to be insulted by a doctor.

I would like to preface this by saying this is the first review I have done in my life.
I went to this urgent care while I was awaiting an appointment from the dermatologist and was in distress and pain.
I spoke with the doctor for about five minutes, not examined and rushed out of the door.
The doctor prescribed something for which I had no symptoms of and also did nothing to help my situation.
I waited one week and returned to get help and wanted to be at least examined.
The ladies at the front were nice and asked me to fill out a complaint form and the office manager would call me back.
I waited two days and did not receive a call, when I contacted the location they had lost my information!
The employee sent the office manager an email and I waited two more days, still no call.
By this time I already had seen the dermatologist whom easily diagnosed the issue and was in shock that the urgent care did not examine me nor do anything to assist with the issue.
I called the following day since I already left two voicemails on the office managers cell phone and never heard from her.
I would just like a refund since they did not examine me, or provide the services that it states they offer on their site.
I do understand that urgent care cannot do everything, however I think an examination is not out of the question.
I could of called my on call nurse and saved the $100.
This business is URGENT to accept your money and URGENT to get you out the door, however they are not URGENT to provide CARE!

After many emails and phone calls, the office manager Rose finally called me on 3/27/14.
She stated that a doctor would be reviewing the case and calling me within a few days.
Once again, true to form I never received a call back!
I have called her a few times each week since then, (it has now been over one month) leaving messages and still have come to no resolution.
She called me once when I was at work and asked me to call at my convenience.
I returned the call on my lunch and once again no answer, that was over a week ago.
She is never in the office when you call and also never answers her cell phone.
I filed a complaint with the BBB in hopes for a resolution.
Truly horrible business practices, lack of care and poor management skills.

For some reason my review was not being shown that I submitted over one month ago: I would like to preface this by saying this is the first review I have done in my life.
