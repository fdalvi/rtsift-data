This place is hidden in a strip mall.
It is tiny and blink you will miss it.
It is clean, the staff is super friendly, and love their ice cream.

Took my family here a week ago and I was amazed by how busy it was.
I was afraid that we were going to have a long wait but we were in and out in minutes.
Great employees too!
The girls were super smiley and laughing.
It made us all feel good.
We will be back!

This is the only place I can find my favorite ice cream.
I've been coming here for years and I've never once had a problem with this place.
I've cream really brings out the kid in us so I would recommend the clown cone, it's really cute and everybody loves it.
