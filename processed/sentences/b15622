I'm from NY and have only found a few places that come close.
Just bought my house by this place so one Saturday morning we decided to try it!
Waste of $!
we spent $34 for lunch, my wings where under cooked and slimy and had feathers in them!
Mozzarella sticks where not even cooked all the way!
Will not go back!

We ordered delivery and was greatly disappointed!
Chicken fingers were horrible and my Philly steak was soggy and nasty.
When I called back to complain staff was very rude and said no one ever complains and that is what a Philly is.
She was a major bitch and has no idea what customer service is.
I hope they are out of business soon!
