They Are Open SWEEEEEET!
I had a Heath Bar Blizzard it was the BOMB!
I will frequent this place.
AWESOME!

It's DQ so I didn't expect much however I did expect they could get a Blizzard right.
This place sent out coupons stating to come on down and try out their new location.
I showed up to find a closed sign and construction tools were scattered all over the inside.
Kind of a disappointment but I figured I'd just check back the following week.
When I went back there was a sign on the door stating they would be opening that night.
I figured they would need to pull off a miracle because the same tools were all over the place.
The sign said they would be open though and the sign wasn't there the previous week so I went back that evening.
Same tools everywhere and they weren't open.
Someone did show up to at least remove the sign.
A couple weeks later they finally opened.
I stopped in to get a mini blizzard with reese's and oreos.
I sat at a table and waited about 10 minutes when a girl brought out a dipped cone for me.
What?
I didn't order that so I showed her my receipt and she said she would make what I ordered right away.
She threw away the dipped cone, such a waste, and went to make what I hoped would be what I ordered.
As she walked back out, she realized she made a medium blizzard instead of a mini and proceeded to throw it away to go back and make me the right size since I paid for a mini and not a medium.
With the waste of the 2 ice creams she threw out I don't see how giving me the medium she mistakenly made to me would have been a big deal.
The blizzard was decent however the whole ordeal of getting it wasn't a good experience at all.
Can't say I'll be back.

DQ is the perfect place to kick off the Fourth of July weekend.
Our blizzards were upside down right thick, just the way it should be.
The service was a bit slow but having Christian music playing makes up for that and is why I give it 5 stars.
