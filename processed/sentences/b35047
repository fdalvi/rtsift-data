Amazing customer service!
I drive an '04 Toyota Corolla S. This is the second time I've used them within 6 months (apparently people like to rearend me.......... ha ) and they always do a great job!
I trust them with any body work!
My car came back looking like I had just bought it at the dealership!
They were even able to squeeze a few more dollahzz out of the other persons' insurance company and were able to fix a few other damages my car had suffered over time!
Things that were not even related to the accident!
Love them!
Love their staff!
Love their work!
Highly recommended!

Came here with a friend, to get her car estimated for repair.
Walking in, it was quiet and peaceful.
No loud noises, no people, just the way I like it.
The customer service was good.
They offered us magazines, coffee and water as we waited.
The woman, yes woman, who came out to work on my car was extremely knowledgeable.
Straight to the point, and no wasting time.
It was refreshing to deal with a woman instead of a man.
Ive been a places where men talk down to you or ASSume you dont know what your talking about.
Overall process took about 12 minutes max and she went and set up an appointment, faxed all the paper work to my friends insurance/lawyer saving us time.
Update to be seen soon!

I went to Collison Authority as it was one of the selected service providers for my insurance company and it had good reviews on Yelp.
I had to have my passenger door replaced as someone back up into it.
I had a great experience.
John the service rep was really nice.
It was done in four days as promised and I am very happy with the results.
I did not consider price as it was paid by the person's policy (same insurance company as mine).
