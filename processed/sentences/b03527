Psycho Jock has done all the embroidery and silk screening for our retail items.
The quality of the clothes they can get are great.
Lily will also give you her opinion on all the merchandise and she is super knowledgeable about all of the items they can order.
I would definitely recommend them.

LOVE Psycho Jock.
My company was having a hard time finding someone who could embroider one of our logos and still make it look classy.
Not only did Psycho Jock pull it off, they did it in a very short time frame.
John, one of the owners, actually came all the way down to our office (a 45-60 minute drive) on a Saturday to bring us samples.
Then, one of the employees met me half way to deliver the shirts.
Great customer service plus high quality work.
I'm a fan.

Great experience with Psycho Jock on my low volume order.
They make good on the customer service claim that they service "needs as small as 1 hat, to 5,000 shirts", as I only wanted two shirts done, and they treated me as if I was getting 200 hundred.
Neal is awesome.
He listened to what I was looking for and his communication was fast and professional.
The whole thing, from first communication to finish was done in around a week, which met our extremely tight deadlines.
I had never had embroidery of our logo done, and Neal created sew-outs in two sizes so I could pick the best one for my project.
We selected the one that met our needs, and the final product turned out great.
Very proud of the shirts that Psycho Jock created for us.
Can't wait for our next trade show when I can show them off.
Hoping we can find some more stuff to do and come back to Psycho Jock.
