Was a guest of Aria last summer...which then got me interested in the first public space fine art collection offered.
Exists around Mandarin Oriental, at Aria, Veer Towers, and Vdara.
All the more appealing now that Guggenheim has shut its doors.
This time, we left the Encore and went to Westin in order to be closer to the heart of Strip.
After Le Reve, we went off to enjoy Mirage's LOVE.
also closer.
Breathtaking.
Though it was 117 degrees, our scorching scavenger-hunt like tour with assistance of spray and water bottle was wonderful!
Henry Moore, Maya Lin, sculptures, paintings, prints (Christopher Walken), etc.
Great treat for those who prefer not to gamble.
And great way to walk off great, overindulgent food too!
PS download the app as we did.
Sure made finding the marvelous pieces waay easier.
Be prepared to walk!

Located between Aria en route to The Mandarin Oriental this small gallery features one of the largest Chihuily collections available for purchase in the United States and although there is a good chance most of us could not even justify a $5400 bowl after a big jackpot the staff is incredibly accommodating, educational, and informative - qualities far removed from much of the gallery scene both here and across the country.

Beautiful Chihuily art collections.
You can see some of his art as you're walking in City Center, between Aria and Mandarin Oriental.
Places like these is what makes City Center so appealing (at least to me).
I know there's brand name clothes stores and shops, but the art is what gets me here.
If you're ever in the area, stop in and enjoy the art, it's beautiful hand blown glass that everyone should appreciate.
