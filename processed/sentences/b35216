Arizona Dog Sitting watched  my Siberian Husky this passed weekend.
It was a very simple process, Marie came to my home for a consultation before I left so Marie, myself, and my dog felt comfortable with each other.
She appeared to have a real gift for animals.
My dog loved her, and that's all I can really ask for.
Came home and everything was just the way we left it.
I will use Arizona Dog Sitting again.

We were going out of town for a couple of days and were fortunate to not have to go through the hassle of worrying about inconveniencing our friends or family to stop by and feed our pets.
Marie came over for a consultation before we left so she could meet our little critters, find out their needs, and where everything is.
While we were gone she sent us cute little picture updates of our babies being spoiled.
It was a great experience and I look forward to future, worry free trips.

I just took a three-night, four-day trip to a wedding and my pet sitting plans fell thru two days before.
I called Marie based on the previous Yelp reviews.
Marie is wonderful!
She is passionate about pets, is totally professional and I whole-heatedly give her five stars!!!
Marie took a photo of my dog at each visit (they are some of my favorite pics of him now), she also filled out these adorable doggie report cards that talked about their adventures, his mood, his eating and pooping.
:) my seven year old loved them and read them all to me while I did post trip laundry.
The whole experience with Marie and Arizona Dog Sitting could not have been better!
Please call Marie...you'll be "wagging your tail" happy you did!
