Have been going to MCV Salon for more than a year.
Always excellent service.
Corina is friendly and energetic.
I always get a fantastic haircut.
Very well put together shop.

I admit, I have very high expectations when it comes to service and this place was AMAZING.
The stylist definitely took the time to listen to my concerns regarding my hair, gave me a oil/ head massage before shampooing my hair, a hand massage while my hair was conditioning and an amazing cut all for the low price of $33!
I already have plans to make it back.
Thank you for being so wonderful!

Caitlin is an amazing stylist.
She took time to hear what I had to say before jumping in.
I have hair that is going grey, but is brown with blonde highlights.
I am very particular about my hair.
She is the first person in a long time who has made my hair look like it used to when I was younger.
You can see the highlights after the coloring has been done - versus a highly-rated place I used to go to where everything ended up muddled together and you would have thought I did the coloring myself.
My biggest issue, and reason for knocking this down a star is that they don't take credit card tips and the pricing is high.
It was $200 for color and haircut, which is very high.
To not take credit card tips at this price point is ridiculous.
I was embarrassed that I have to come back with a cash tip for my stylist.
