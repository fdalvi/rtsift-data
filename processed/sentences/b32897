This is by far my fav boutique in Las Vegas!
The clothes are reasonably priced - some higher end more expensive pieces, too.
The more expensive pieces are classic and you will have in your wardrobe for a long long time.
What I love about this store is that you won't see anyone else wearing the same thing - unique and stylish clothing.
Of course, they have jewelry, sunglasses, purses, accessories, too!!
Now my favorite part of this store is the people who work there.
They clearly love what they do - which is they love fashion and they love helping others love fashion as much as they do.
They honestly want you to look your best!
Ever go into a department store, try something on and know it doesn't look right - - but the salesperson says "oh, that looks great".
Well, at BluNoir they will tell you the TRUTH in an honest but not insulting way.
Instead they will find you something that does look truly GREAT on you and flatters your body type, whatever body type you have.
They also offer fashion advice, if you ask - ie, what shoes should I wear with this, what jewelry would you wear, etc., etc.
They have designer inspired merchandise (think Roberto Cavalli) at much cheaper prices.
They also carry NYDJ styles which I have not seen in Nordstrom - for example, recently bought a pair of leopard jeans which are a-mazing!
If you're at Tivoli, check this place out - you will love it.
My fav store and by far my fav stylists (as they never "sell" you - but instead style you!!).
Happy shopping!

The styles in this terrific little shop are more European and less "Vegas" boutique.
I have found unique pieces that you won't see on every other woman in Las Vegas.
They range in prices to fit many budgets.
The jewelry and handbags also seem one of a kind.
And to add to the charm of this great place is the staff!
They are very helpful and friendly.
They treat locals very well and that along with the fresh style keeps me coming back.
Thanks BluNoir!
