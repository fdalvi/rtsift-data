Crap.
Bud Light, Miller Lite, Coors Light on tap and not much else.
Guinness from a can?
Seriously?
Cold fried food and way overpriced appetizer sampler.
Server never offered silverware or condiments like salt.
Avoid.

Wow - not good.
The place was really not what I expected at all.
The selections were few, and the food - cold.
