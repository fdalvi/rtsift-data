That's a sweet deal that McD is having Big Mac late-night for $1.00 starting from 8pm-4Am but too bad it's kind of out of my way to come & get it.

This place was convenient to me because I planned on doing a little grocery shopping afterwards and it's literally inside of the Walmart at Centennial Center.
For a morning I'm usually used to McDonald's being unnecessarily busy, whether it's the drive through or in-store.
I guess since this one is located in the Walmart it's not frequented as much as the other ones in town.
I walked in and was able to order immediately.
I've been to countless McDonalds' where they pre-cook the sausage burritos and let them sit for hours, then the tortilla gets hard and it's just not enjoyable.
Here, I forgot to ask them not to, but was VERY happy when we got the burritos and they were hot and fresh with soft tortillas.
Everything else was pretty standard.
I had a sausage egg & cheese mcmuffin that was surprisingly well assembled (but I'm sure this can vary by cook instead of store location) and a coffee that was made how I like it.
Everyone here was friendly and the dining area was spotless.
There isn't much more you could ask for in a McDonalds.

Every time I come to this McDonald's it's so dirty.
I know it's just a fast food restaurant inside Wal Mart, but it should be a little cleaner than this.
