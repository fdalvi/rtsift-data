I drive by here all the time, but never really paid attention.
Now I know what this is.
It's a scrap yard.
They pay for scrap (mostly metal).
In my case I had a dead water heater to get rid of.
It doesn't pay a lot, but it's still about $8 for something I would otherwise probably have to pay to have hauled away.
The staff was very friendly and helpful.
I will definitely come here again if I have scrap to dispose of.
And they're open Saturday till 1pm

Excellent experience.
I rarely go to any place especially a metal recycler that impresses me.
So kind and curious.

Awesome place.
They take all kinds of metals.
Aluminum, steel, microwave ovens, water heaters, etc.
just makes you think twice before throwing something away.
Just wish they had more amicable hours.
