Very happy I found this dentist.
He is very skilled, gentle and efficient.
I just got my wisdom teeth out there and it was done in under 30 minutes and healed up easy peasy.
His staff is very friendly as well.
He does all his own dental hygiene which seemed odd at 1st but I actually have come to like it best.
Guess that makes things flow even faster.
I have never had more than a 5 minute wait when I have gone in.
