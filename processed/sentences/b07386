Moving from the edge of nowhere (San Tan Valley) into the big city was exciting, frightening and stressful all rolled into one.
After living in the far east valley for the better part of 8 years I grew used to the quiet and mostly crime free living environment of my surroundings.
The thought of apartment life unsettled me.
After looking for months at many different apartments, I stumbled my way to Lexington on Central.
My first thought was that these must be condos as they have a condo feel to them.
With further investigation I discovered they were apartments for rent.
After looking at what Lexington on Central had to offer, to my relief, my search was over.
This gated, Clean & quiet complex was just what I was looking for.
Yes, super quiet, right in the middle of uptown Phoenix.
The complex has a weight room, spa, pool and an entertainment facility that you can rent for parties.
Lexington on Central is also just steps away from the Light Rail.
If you are looking for bargain accommodations , these will not be for you as rents are spendy.
Spendy or not, sometimes you do get what you pay for.

I moved across country and have lived at Lexington on Central for three months now.
Their staff is great quality, the sales staff, the maintenance staff, everyone.
The grounds are kept nice, safe and clean.
The location is amazing, easy to get anywhere and the light rail and bus stops are very close.
If you get a unit mid-back of the complex it is very quiet even though on a busy street.
