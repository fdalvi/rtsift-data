Nancy has been styling my hair for 16 years now and she has never done me wrong.
She is very professional, knowledgable, and skilled in her profession.
Her salon in very clean, private, and inviting.
She only uses quality products and also offers a beautiful jewelry line.
If you are looking for a stylist that will take the time to listen to your needs and provide you with excellent service and care, then you found your girl.
You will receive great service with top of the line products in a non-intimidating and peaceful setting.
Plus your hair will look fabulous!

I LOVE YOU NANCY!
From Chicago with love and adoration!
My sister took me in to see Nancy when I was visiting out in Arizona...sigh.
Nancy is a true professional, GREAT sense of humor - and LOVED YOUR PRICES!
Would have paid triple back in the windy city.
It's so hard to find a hairstylist that listens to what you are saying...then when you look in the mirror when the job is done...you get exactly what was asked for!
Can't wait to come back out again...Nancy would love to see you again!

Nancy is simply the best.
She does precision cutting, excellent color ( and mine is red, which is hard to do right)  and is wonderful to interact with.
He salon is private and there is never a wait for the prior appt to get done.
Thank you Nancy
