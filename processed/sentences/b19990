Had dinner here last night with 2 friends and was very impressed.
How they manage to produce 3 courses of such quality for £14.95 is a wonder.
Service was always efficient and polite and mostly timely.
The occasional cobweb in view and the misspelling of California on the wine list were minor quibbles.
All 3 of us began with the Goats Cheese Crumble w/ Beetroot.
For main I had the Turkey Fillet (ordering a side-dish of veg with this might be a good idea for some), whilst the girls enjoyed the sirloin on one hand and the Pea Risotto on the other.
To finish I plumped for the Banana & Peanut Cheesecake which was an acquired taste but I certainly got what I asked for and the portion size rivals Howie's famous Banoffe Pie.
The Chilean Cab.
Sauv.
I washed my food down with was a decent little number too (half bottle £12).
Definitely one to go back to.
Stopped back in here for Afternoon Tea at the end of last week.
Good vfm at £14.95 (like most hotels the bar prices are steeper than average though) but could have done with jam to go with the scones & cream and I imagine there are probably other places in town that have an edge over it for this sort of thing.
If you go though take the option of having it in the garden at the rear as it's much more chilled than the bar or lobby.
