This location has a listening problem.
A "Super Supreme" pizza somehow got turned into a cheese pizza.
And if you order pizza rolls for the kids they like to forget the marinara sauce.
Even for corporate pizza to satisfy the kids this location needs to work on a few fundamentals such as listening and proper order entry.
At least when they mess up they will own up to it.
2 pizzas and pizza rolls for $7 is kinda nice.
Edit: This location will make Buffalo Chicken Pizza which is an off-menu item.
And they made it without fuss.
Even though they messed up the order, the fact they made it and tried to make the order right warrants the star rating in our book.

I ordered a pizza dinner deal online for $10 plus delivery and I the guy that brought me the pizza was a jerk to me and wouldn't take my quarters, nickels, dimes, pennies and he said u are a wasted of my time and I said we'll give me corporate number and the guy asked why and I said we'll if u not going to take my money then maybe u should get fired and he said ok and he took my money and said I'm the manger and next time don't do this shit and I recorded the whole thing.
I called corporate and they are sending me $100 Giftcard plus 4 medium pizza coupons for free.
I WILL NEVER DO BUSSINESS WITH THIS PIZZA HUT EVER AGAIN!!!!!!!

Seems weird to review a Pizza Hut...because, well...it's Pizza Hut.
But I've gotten delivery three times in the last month or so and felt like it was deserving of a rating at least.
I love the convenience of online ordering.
We always customize our pizzas and each time they have been 100% correct and cooked perfectly.
Also, the pizza (and wings, breadsticks, etc) have been HOT and the 2 liters are COLD - seems like a no-brainer, but not too many delivery places have that down.
The delivery folks are super friendly (even in the presence of my yapping little wiener dog) and every time they have delivered on time or early.
We did take-out a while back too, and the folks in the store were awesome.
For a national chain (pizza no less) where your success is based mostly on low prices and location, I have to say the customer service here is turned up a notch.
It's now our go-to place for cheap pizza delivery (oh and it really tastes pretty good too!
