Yesterday I checked in at the wrong Starbucks by accident.
Anyways, this is truly the correct one.
Sometimes the drive thru is lengthy but going inside is always an option.
They are extremely friendly and 98% right on every order.

I went to this Starbucks because I had time to kill before meeting a client nearby.
I don't like this as much as the other Starbucks because there's no drive thru, so you have to walk into Albertsons and the ones located in a grocery store usually don't use the phone app (not convenient).

I saw little flying bugs in the pastry cabinet!
EW EW EW.
On the pastry and flying!!!
There was only one guy working so I wasn't too upset about how long the wait was.
There were three people waiting for their drinks.
But it gave me enough time to choose what I wanted.
I ended up getting large passion fruit tea and it tasted like water.
My stomach was kinda sick afterwards, not too sure if it was just me over thinking the bug thing or what.
But this was my first and last time at this Starbucks.
I'll stick to the actual stores.
