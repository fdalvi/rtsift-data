Rocco's Restaurant is one of the best places to stop off for food if you are on the Royal Mile.
This place looks like a club from the outside, so I almost wasn't going to go in, but the friend I was with was fairly insistent and so we went for a look and ended up having a wonderful meal.
Rocco's is an Italian restaurant and a very fine one at that.
Their menu offers a wide selection of authentic Italian cuisine, including pastas, pizzas and soups.
I had the marinated olives to start, which were really delicious and I got a fair amount of olives for one portion was was very inexpensive, costing about £2.50.
I then had a pasta dish with salmon and cream which was absolutely gorgeous - the pasta was perfectly cooked and the salmon was really fresh - yum!
My friend ordered a pizza which he was amazing too, with lots of cheese and toppings.
The staff were super friendly and welcoming and the prices were really good for the main meals too, costing about £8.
A really great Italian restaurant which is definitely worth a look.

Lasagne tasted very poor, worse than supermarket "heat at home".
Compulsory service charge added.
Wine extremely poor and overpriced.
I would not go to this restaurant, and wished I had read the other reviews first.
Clearly catering for the one time only visitor and resting on it's location to get custom with no need of any reputation.
Seemed to have some regulars though!
Do not go to this restaurant.
