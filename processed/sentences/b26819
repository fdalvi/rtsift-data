Better than papa johns right next door

I have always loved pizza hut!
This location is pretty consistant with any other Pizza Hut location.
We had delivery and our items arrived within 30 mins, hot and yummy!
:-)

Well... About a month ago I had pizza here.
This is my normal pizza place close to home now.
It is cheap.
And quick.
And offers online ordering making it easy.
However last month my pizza was made and was terrible.
The pan pizza crust was thin and didn't have that normal buttery fluffy taste.
The toppings were minimal.
It did not even have that normal Pizza Hut flavor.
I was so disappointed.
And even though it was only 10 dollars or so I felt ripped off.
Nobody likes their money going in the garbage.
I made a comment to the company because I feel it is important for them to know.
I was contacted back via email to which I responded.
I still have yet to hear from them!
Pretty disappointed in the Pizza Hut team for this location if they do not respond however at least their pizza seems to be improved now... (See my next review)

I have this Pizza Hut 5 stars simply bc the delivery guy was awesome.
He was so friendly and sweet.
Good customer service goes a long way.
Ordered pizza and wings and was exactly how it should taste coming from Pizza Hut

Shelly here is awesome!
Every time I go in with my son she is so friendly and interacts with him.
Even when we only go in to get his free pizza for being a good reader in school.
She'll never rush him, engage him in a conversation and is generally very friendly.
