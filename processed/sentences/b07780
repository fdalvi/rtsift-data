I love this place, especially because it is next to my office (walking distance doesn't hurt).
I have a landscape company and take all my fleet vehicles here because I can really trust them.
I had them replace the transmission in one of my trucks with 80,000 miles on it and it only cost me $1200 because they got me a rebuilt one instead of new since the truck is so old and will probably be replaced within a year or two.
I can always count on these guys to get my vehicles back to me in a short amount of time.
The guys that work here are all great and Tony who runs the shop is from the east coast and you can hear it in his voice and attitude.
One time I took my 2008 GMC pickup in to have the headlight changed since the online manual said it takes 50 minutes and gave me instructions to take off half the front end just to change the bulb!
That is GM for you!
Anyway Tony had one of his guys who is like double jointed or something change the bulb without taking everything off, it took him 3 minutes and didn't charge me anything since I brought the bulb with me.
Make sure you tell them that Eli sent you since they all know me well there.

Add me to the list of positive reviews..My '93 Dakota had failed the pressure test several times..I ran out of time and patience, and took it to EE for repair...The pressure test test is $100, and they fixed it with no extra charges.

Everyone at Emission Express is absolutely wonderful.
I was in a major state of distress when my fuel pump on my 2002 Chevy S10 decided to kick the bucket (right around the corner from this shop), and they were the absolute best to me.
I worked mostly with Tony, who was so nice, helped calm me down, and really made sure I was taken care of.
Great/Fair pricing, really great workforce, just a nice crew all around.
I absolutely recommend these guys to anyone who needs car repair, and it's also worth noting that they do have their own Tow Truck!
