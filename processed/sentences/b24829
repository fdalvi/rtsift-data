I was here to support my husband while he had an MRI done.
BTW this place is open late and very nice.
There is no shady MRI's done here (trying to be funny).
Staff was really nice except for the guy doing the MRI, husband said he came off rude and like he didn't want to be there.
All in all we both pleased with the place.

Been there twice, first time bad.
Second time good.
They redeemed themselves.

Was referred for an xray by my doctor.
Unfortunately they had some maintenance happening on their machine when I went the first time, so the second time there was a 90 minute wait.
However, when I went back the next morning, it was only 15 minutes.
The tech was fast and boom I was finished.
Good little place!

This is a nice location and the facility is newer and spacious.
The tech was friendly and quick.
Even the result turn around time was very good.
However, the front desk staff could have been a little more friendly and inviting.
They seemed pretty robotic in what they were doing.
Kinda like just another day at work feeling....topped off with "Is it 5'0 clock yet?".
Still giving them 4 stars and would go again.
