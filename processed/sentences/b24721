This place is very poorly ran, it is the only gas station I know that takes an hour to run in for a pack of smokes, bad customer service, out of stock of common items, have had multiple problems.
Avoid if you can.

place is ok nothing great

This place is fantastic!!!!
I love the people that work there, so nice and very helpful.
Jen, Darren, Sean and the manager Cody are why this place is so great.

Employees here are great they are fast and helpful.
I go here 4 time a week before work and I'm always out within minutes.
Its clean and there snacks are decently priced

Definitely not a fast gas station.
However for the most part or any time except for today very nice employees!
I believe this girl is new but they aren't giving cash back and she was extremely rude about it.
Even you continuing to be rude with a smart comment as I walked out the door!
In today's economy and the way the jobs are there's no reason to have an employee with an attitude like that she should be fired.
This was an unfinished post from a few months ago !

I really like this store.
It is huge and the staff is great.
They were down to earth and friendly.
I would stop here again.
This store is also clean from what I seen.
