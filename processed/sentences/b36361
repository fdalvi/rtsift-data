This place is cool!
I took my kids and they completely enjoyed themselves.
It's family owned...  everyone is so nice.
Go see for yourself.

Best batting cages in Gilbert or Queen Creek.
It's a great way to get hits in without being outside.
The staff is always friendly and accommodating.
My daughter just started with a hitting coach at Grip & Rip & we already see improvement.
Highly recommend.

Great place.
Met the owner today who was very personable.
We will be returning no doubt!
Support locally owned businesses.
My boys Gavin and Garrett really liked the cages and facility.

Great employees, always nice, always helpful always.
Able drop my son off and run errands with no issues.
Nice clean well set up facility.
They sell cold water Gatorade you can borrow bats helmets.
Great place to come practice good value for your money.
