Went into the location and waited minutes for someone to appear to ask us for our order and even after we said Hello they didn't acknowledge us.
Had to repeat order several times.
It was very frustrating how nothing seemed to be in stock, no philly cheese steak nor soup was available.
I heard someone as I was leaving being told some type of bread wasn't available (which is actually understandable, condiments and bread sometimes run out or need to be retrieved/baked).
Felt like we were being rushed and just didn't feel like a clean place.
Will not go back.

My favorite sub shop.
Great sandwiches friendly staff.
We stop there a couple times a week.

Stopped in on a Saturday for a quick lunch.
Looked for another one, but this location was on the way.
Having been here once before and having had an unpleasant experience, we were a bit reluctant to stop again.
Ordered two subs, chips and a drink.
Sandwiches were good.
Bread was very fresh.
Lots of veggies.
Smaller selection of veggies than most places and no lite or low calorie condiments available.
The problem with this location (and why we won't be back) is the manager.
The same lady was there as on the previous visit.
She is unpleasant.
Doesn't make you feel welcome.
Will not be back.....

Running errands on my lunch break and had a stop in this plaza... noticed Blimpie and stopped in... disappointment: wilted-tan lettuce, cucumbers tasted dirty, Fritos were stale and diet Pepsi was lacking syrup.
I will not be returning... seems family owned and not operated to Blimpie standards...
