I went to the location they have in Central Phoenix, as a court ordered referral for some trouble I had gotten into several months ago and truthfully this place is a joke.
Hands down they could care less about the individual and are only interested in the mighty dollar, I would suggest that the state revokes the doctor's that work here license for the fact that their code of ethics are garbage.
You truly are a number here.
I would not suggest that anyone ever tries this place out.
Go somewhere else...seriously!!!
The only person in this whole place who was friendly was the receptionist.
I would give this place negative 1000 stars and pray that it gets struck by lightning it sucks so bad.
I went back to the courts for another referral this place was so bad.
I would rather sit in front of the judge in the central court system and deal with a wonderful additional date in court then be forced to participate in any out patient program this business has to offer, which I did so I could go some where else.
I would rather have hot metal spikes shoved in my urinary tract then go to this place.
I hope this convinces you how much this place sucks.

I was seeking a place that I could go to strengthen my marriage and was given a referral.
The classes are group sessions and of the 2 hour block that you attend there is about 20 mins of content.
If you approach the instructor at the end of the class in a sincere matter you are quickly brushed off as the instructor seems to be trying to escape as if they know they place is about to be bombed.
