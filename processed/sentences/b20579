This restaurant had only been open for about six weeks when we visited.
The food is a strange mix of the kind of tastes which instantly transport you to Greece, with a few dishes that carry way to much lemon.
The tzatziki and gigantes were fabulous, for example, as was the halloumi.
And the sea bass was awesome.
However the stifado was not pleasant; the beef was beautifully cooked, but instead of the familiar rich taste of onion, it was far too lemony.
And it wasn't just me - others at the table found the same with some other dishes too.
I'm not sure whether the chef is over-compensating for western taste buds, but if they were to back off from the lemon, I'm sure it would all be good.
My other criticism would be that there was simply far too much food, and so a lot of it got wasted.
Our party all have hearty appetites, but there was no way we could finish much more than half of what was on the plates.
The restaurant itself is lovely inside, and would be ideal for both couples or for quite large groups.
And the staff are extremely polite and attentive.
Hopefully we just caught things on a bad day, or they're just getting into the swing of things, as I'd dearly love to have a reliable Greek restaurant in Edinburgh.
I'll go back and try a second time, but if it's the same then, it'll be my last visit.

I like the Athena.
Friendly service, and it was quite quiet the night we went.
Food very good, I particularly enjoyed the kleftiko (lamb shanks).
The stuffed vine leaves were also very tasty.
Prices quite reasonable too.
