Great looking gallery and customer service.
The frame and mat choices were overwhelming but the girl (Stacy?
) was really helpful.
The finished piece looks better than I imagined on the magnetic display they use.
I have recommended and will be back again after my trip.

I called them about a week and a half ago just looking for ballpark pricing to frame an autographed Jordy Nelson football card.
Stacy was very helpful over the phone and gave me a price range that worked for me.
When I went to the store, I met with Stacy and the price went a bit above the quote but she kept her word and brought it back down.
They finished the framing in about 2 days, which was 12 days sooner then she said it would take.
I also had them frame my amusingly large diploma.
Again, a very quick turn around and I couldn't be happier with how they turned out.
