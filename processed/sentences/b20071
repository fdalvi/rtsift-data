Herbie's does my head in.
This branch is tiny, which means if you're a claustrophobe like me you can only shop here mid week.
At the weekend there are too many folk in too small a space stocking up on Artisan bread and chicken liver pate.
That said, their pate is the finest this side of the Channel.
But (and it is a whopper of a 'but') the artisan loaves come in at just under £3 and there is no space to browse.
Pick a quiet moment and you can enjoy the wide range of fresh deli produce and bottled oils, preserves and trucklements.
Dither during a busy moment and you'll be as welcome as a tourist in a New York diner.

Aberdeen Angus Rare Roast Beef, Wild Venison Haggis, Brie De Meaux, Chicken Liver Pate, and fresh crunchy crusty bread -- now that's what I call an absolutely perfect Saturday afternoon meal... Oh, if only I lived closer to this little bit of heaven!

The chicken liver paté is delicious -- any time I'm over that side of town I make a detour to pick some up.
On the other hand, their bread which they claim to be the best in Edinburgh is okay but overpriced.
