Great to work with, repairs were done on my schedule and done right the first time.
Great customer service, would use again and highly recommend them.

I just got my windshield replaced on my 2012  Toyota Highlander again after replacing it on 6-22-12.
I had it done by Cobblestone Auto Glass which uses Novus after a large rock hit it and cracked it.
I did not realize it was cracked until I took the car to get a car wash done.
I thought they did a decent job but yesterday a little pebble hit my windshield and cracked it again.
I could not believe such a little thing could crack a windshield and I thought maybe Novus did not use quality glass so I called Xpress Auto Glass based on the review and I am glad I did.
Blake looked at the glass and told me it is a good glass but the installation was faulty.
Previous installer did not use the clip on the bottom/middle of the windshield and did not adjust the windshield evenly after installing it.
I watched Blake adjusting the windshield after putting it on which the other guy did not do.
I would definitely use Xpress Auto Glass again if we ever need to replace any auto glasses.
Thank you Blake for job well done.

I would recommend using this company to everybody I know!
The installer was kind and courteous.
The install was done in a timely manner and the installer was very knowledgeable.
My husband and I were extremely pleased with his work and found out that he is actually master certified in automotive installation.
Knowing that the installer was master certified and knowledgeable made us feel even more at ease knowing the job would be done right.
