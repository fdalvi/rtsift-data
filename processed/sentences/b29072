No one does it better then Kevin at Help My Swing.
I was referred here by a co-worker of mine and boy am I grateful.
Kevin has a true knack for people and knowledge of the game of golf.
He's a true gentlemen who actually cares to help whatever it is that you need.
I had my clubs bent and fitted for my swing...since then I've had crisper ball striking and more confidence from tee to green.
A+ here Kevin, thank you sincerely.

I went there last year for a few weeks to get some lessons.
Kevin seems to be a good instructor.
I like his method of teaching you how to swing the club.
I have only played a few times after my lessons, but I was swinging the club much better then I was prior to my lessons.
I would definitely recommend this place for golf lessons.

Kevin is awesome!
I've been looking for someone to help my game for years and I have finally found the best.

After going through various golf instructors my daughter has finally found someone that connects with her and is really breaking down the concept of a good swing.
Kevin has cut strokes off her game and she is improving each time we meet.
Thank you Kevin your system does work.
