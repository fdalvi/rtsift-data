Went through a process of getting 3 bids for a move to Reno.
Aaction Movers (aka United Van Lines) were the highest coming in $2900 more than the other two bids.
We went with Atlas until they told us at the last minute that they had made a mistake and it would be an additional $1640 (ouch) so we went to the next low bid Allied.
Lo and behold at the final hour they found an error and also added $1437 (ouch again) We finally went back to United and said that if they could meet our time schedule we would go with them even though their price was still higher.
Couldn't believe when I got a call from United saying they couldn't move us because they were not authorized to move within the state (only Las Vegas) Does any moving company know what they are doing???
Feel like I have been dealing with some very shady used car salesmen.

Horrible.
Delivered belongs late and broke multiple items.
Communication could not be worse.
Two months after move still trying to get items replaced or fixed.
Save yourself time, money and stress by using ANY other moving company.

We recently completed a move with AAction Movers and I am completely impressed.
I am a military wife of 28 years and this is the smoothest move we have ever had.
NOTHING was broken!
Nothing not one thing.
The employees were 100% professional and fun.
Boxes were well marked and items that had to be taken apart were put back together with out satisfaction.
When we move again I will demand this company!
