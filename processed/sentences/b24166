If my insurance didn't require me to use this pharmacy, I would never set foot in it.
For a national chain, their supply of "in store" drugs is limited, thus EVERYTHING has to be ordered.
When they call around to other CVS stores, they don;t have the drugs either.
Orders are not filled in a timely manner, and the staff are unfriendly.
There is little communication between staff memebers, so the call you placed yesterday, no one knows about today.
Each trip in turns into a marathon visit, becuase no one knows what the heck they are doing.

Go to Walgreens instead, it is cheaper and better

I am not against national chains and I like the convenience of a CVS always being nearby where I am.
The Middleton store however is not up to par with the other CVS stores I have experienced.
Seemingly lazy staff with poor attitudes are the norm rather than the exception.
If you can you another location I would.
CVS in other locations has been great.
