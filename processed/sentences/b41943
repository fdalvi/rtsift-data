I had a craving for Pho and egg rolls and this is the place definitely hit the spot .

This review is based on their pho.
Being that I am a friend of one of the employees, I got a tour of how they make their pho.
I posted three photos from the kitchen (grilling onions, ingredients, and simmering pot).
They use an assortment of beef and beef bones with the ingredients in the pictures.
They told me it takes about 12 hours of simmering to make the soup.
I have been to many pho places in LV and here in Colorado.
It may be a subtle difference, but most pho places' soup base isn't as flavorful as the one I had at Pho Lan.
After seeing how they make their soup base, I appreciate the food and their pho a lot more.

great service  customized and great food!

Ate here about 7:20 pm Sat/12 Jul with my NY visiting buddy and his family (spouse and kids): - We tried this place since it's so close to my home.
- Everyone enjoyed their food, which included marinated beef, pho, vermicelli, eggrolls appetizers.
- Prices are reasonable.
- Nice ambiance, great service.

If you want authentic Vietnamese come to this place.
Service was great they explained everything to me so I understand and get the food I may like.
Gotta admit it was a first for me that someone greeted me at the door to say hi before just plopping me to a table and said how any people.
Wow, they actually checked on me constantly.
Def would come back
