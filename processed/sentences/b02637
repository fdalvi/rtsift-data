Awesome - I have been going here for about 3 months now.
Rose does my nails and I absolutely think she takes the time to do it right.
It's nice to know someone takes their time and doesn't rush.
A little on the high end - but worth it!

Strictly on eyebrow wax service- First time I visited to have my eyebrows done they turned out great- nice and thin.
The last few times I've visited they haven't turned out well at all, even though I request them thin as they grow fast.
Guess it depends on who does them!
Overall, clean store and staff is mostly friendly.

Came in to get my eyebrows done since I had not gotten them in a while.
I'm new to area so don't know the best place to go.
I was at ups store next to it and decided to drop in.
Can I say... pricey?
Eyebrows turned out ok I guess.
Not shape I'm used to and had a couple extra hairs I requested she take off.
She seemed a bit annoyed by it but since I'm paying I figure I come out satisfied right?
Won't be going again.
