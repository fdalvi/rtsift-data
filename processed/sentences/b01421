This is my Quiktrip.
I'm the Duke, the business photo is mine, and this is their first review, so I'm the boss.
Come on in and enjoy some inexpensive gas, coffee, snacks, and 5 Hour Energy drinks!
Quiktrips are the best convenience store/gas station in the valley.

Close, convenient, clean, and cheap.
The four Cs get five stars.

friendly and fast service!

I have never been to a QuikTrip that I didn't love!
This QT has the famous 'QT Kitchen!
'   As we walked in, and started to browse the kitchen menu, and an employee walked up to me and basically introduced it to me!
This QuikTrip is super busy, but you won't even notice, because they can get you in and out like a freaking lightning bolt.
