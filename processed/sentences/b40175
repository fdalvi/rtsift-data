Worst cable company on earth.
Not only are the rates ridiculous they made me drive in to get a cable box to replace the faulty box I had..
But the "new" box they gave me also didn't work.
Their service is a joke.
We need more options for cable providers.

Cable companies have been doing installations for...what....30 years now?
You'd think they'd have the process down fairly well.
Unfortunately, you'd be wrong.
They still fail to call you, fail to show up on time, fail to do anything they say they're going to do.
I've now wasted two full days based on empty promises from their installation people and I STILL have no idea when I'm actually going to get internet service.
And, because they're a monopoly, I have no choice but to just sit here and take it.
(which probably speaks to why they haven't bothered to improve their installation process at all in the last 30 years)
