Family friendly, great location, affordable, and most importantly very knowledgeable instructors!!

The staff and instructors are super patient with all the children and create a very positive environment.
It is great to see my son continuously improve not only in martial arts but also gain confidence and respect.

Our kids LOVE it here!
Mr. Pino, Mrs. Pino, and Mr. Bonner are fantastic with all of the kids and they get excited for their classes!
Family friendly and a welcoming atmosphere!
We enjoy watching all of the kids learn new kicks, punches, and techniques... all while having a super fun time.
We are so thankful to have tried it out and we will continue coming back for more!
ATA STRONG!

Pretty freaking awesome my son has been coming here going on a year and a half and he loves it when he started he was very closes off and shy after a few classes he's made many new friends and is way more out going before.
The instructors are great they sure do have a way with kids.

Great place for Tae Kwon Do.
They treat everyone like family and the workout is great.
They have classes for kids and adults throughout the week so it's easy to find classes that for your schedule.
