Looking for furniture?
This is the place.
Brett (owner) is down to earth.
No salesmen following you around here.
If you don't see it, Brett will be more than happy to sit with you and order it as you wish.
He will make it happen.
Also,    prices are very reasonable for the quality.
Highly recommended.
Stop by and take a peak.

CLOSED......The crook that owned this business closed down , owing manufacturers and customers their deposits.I think Brett reopened under a different name on Dean Martin Drive.

I paid cash up front for furniture here in May of 2010.
By mid July I had not yet received the furniture & when it eventually came at the end of july 2 pieces didn't match & 1 was irreparably scratched.
Not to mention that I never received 2 pieces that were to have come with the set before I showed up & the warehouse was empty.
They had up & left.
If I could track them down & file a small claim suit for theft I would.
