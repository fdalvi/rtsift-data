Service has always been fast and correct.
No errors in the drive through yet.
Inside is clean and for the most part the employees are friendly.

Best McDobalds I've ever been to.
There fries are always fresh.
They have messed up my order only once but they knew right away when I went through the drive thru.
All other McDonalds are ruined for me.

I recommend this McDonald's over the Jack-in-the-Box nearby (see my review).
Service here is consistent with the occasional hiccup associated with fast food places (e.g., wrong burger or no sauce).
Occasionally you get someone working the window who fails to greet you and seems to be in a bit of a trance.
However, the service is generally good and you are "in and out" (drive-thru or inside) in little to no time.
All-in-all: Good place to eat with generally good service.
