Awesome shop!
amazing candles that are hand made in the shop!
Great local made art and gifts too!

I've ready about the local candles made in Cave Creek, but it wasn't until recently that I finally got to visit the shop.
Cave Creek Candles & Gifts is located inside Frontier Town in Downtown Cave Creek and here this hidden local candle shop invites you inside with scents ranging from cinnamon to vanilla.
The candles are handmade in Cave Creek and all are beautiful and come in every shape, size, color and scent.
I learned that the new owner creates paintings using candle wax and displays those paintings in the shop for sale.
This is a great store to visit if you're looking for a gift or a new candle or candle accessory for your home.
They also have plenty of metal and decorative candle holders well.
The candles are reasonably priced which was a nice surprise as well!
That's about it but just make sure you visit this candle shop if you're in the area!

I have to confess, I was first drawn to this shop on a recent trip to Cave Creek because I saw a big sign out front that I thought said "Cave Creek Candies".
Ooo candy!
The initial disappointment I felt at the lack of sugary treats did not last long.
It turns out what was inside was even better.
Each candle is beautifully made by hand inside the shop and the scents are so pure smelling and authentic, by far the best I've ever come across.
The owners are incredibly nice, helpful, and clearly passionate about what they do.
There's a great selection of candle holders and gifts as well and there's the added bonus of knowing your shopping locally and supporting small businesses.
