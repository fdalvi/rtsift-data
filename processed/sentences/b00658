I highly endorse Samuel Kelsall.
He was able to help me and my wife with everything from our will, powers of attorney, and medical directives.
Best part, he takes the Metlaw (Hyatt) legal plan so we got very high quality document preparation and filing covered under our legal plan.
Consider me a happy customer!

Moved to AZ and needed to redo wills, Trust, Powers of Attorney.
Sam was referred to me.
Sam did more for me than my GA. attorney and for less.
What a great guy.
Took my elderly father to see Sam after my dad's wife died and Sam helped guide our family through some estate planning and produced only the documents needing to be changed rather than everything.
I recommend him without any conditions or reservations.
His office staff is FIRST RATE too.

Consulted him for setting up an estate plan.
First meeting was free, and he was informative.
We haven't made our decision yet, but he is definitely worth interviewing for the assignment.
