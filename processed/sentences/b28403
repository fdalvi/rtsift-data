I've stopped in here twice now.
GREAT DEALS!
I got three glass pyrex baking dishes for $1 each..
They're $3-4 each at GoodWill.
My friend bought a brand new dehydrator for $5.
They have clothes, shoes , handbags, jewelry and household goodies.
Its in a very affluent neighborhood so the things are very nice in there, but you're not going to find anything funky.
Plus, all the proceeds go to the rescue group and they're going be doing on-site adoptions as soon as their construction is finished.
Shouldn't be too long now.

Great store (prices and selection)!
Great people!
Geat cause!

Loved this place!
Found it via Yelp.
On the small side yet fairly well organized, stocked and maintained.
Two dressing rooms with mirrors and an assortment of goods from clothing to furniture, jewelry, books, toys, housewares more.
Chalkboard by the cashier displays the specials of the day.
For example, all women's blouses and men's shorts were $3.50 each on my visit.
Shoes from what I could tell are all priced at $6.50 each.
Credit cards OK.
Thank you Jill T. for posting the one and only review (since June 2010, really?
) thus far.
I would have never discovered this place without ya.

I LOVE this thrift store.
The displays are beautiful, merchandise great quality (at unbelievable prices), staff is super friendly & the money goes to helping animals.

FAR is an excellent place to shop for unique clothing, housewares, art, furniture; just about anything you may be looking for!
Most of the people working there are volunteers, so ALL of the money taken in by reselling gently used items goes right to the welfare and care of the dogs and cats they rescue.
It is a great organization with a very nice staff, and the store is maintained very well to make it easy to browse and save!
