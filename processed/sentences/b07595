These guys are no BS.
They offer you what is needed but do not scoff when you decide otherwise.
Prices, stock, and knowledge are all great.
I try to sign up for the emails to be sure to stay alert of the discounts and specials.
Last month was Hayward Days where they give free feet and wings for the Hayward cleaners.
I try to take advantage of that every year.
They will also install used parts if you are on a budget or want to try to extend the life of a cleaner just one more year.

Our family's favorite place for pool supplies and help on pool maintenance and repair.
Friendly, knowledgeable, honest help with all your pool issues.
They won't sell you what you don't need.

Great pool store!!!
Always awesome customer service and great effective advice!!
Thank you for your support over the years with my pool.

WORST SERVICE EVER!
The service is OK in the store, but NEVER call them for a repair!
You probably will find  something better in Craiglist.
Repair department is really unprofessional and unfriendly, their priority is send you a bill instead of customer satisfaction.
You will find other reviews here stating the same, so save some time and money and call somebody else for repairs and try Costco or Online stores for supplies.

Holy cow.
Neighbor dropped his pool cleaner off for repair.
Was told it would be ready in a couple of days.
Went back to pick it up.
He saw his cleaner on the counter in about 19 pieces.
The guy at the desk said that the repair guy was sick and couldn't fix it.
He then put the pieces of the cleaner in a box, pushed it towards my neighbor, said "you'll have to take it somewhere else" and turned around and walked away.
My neighbor just stood there with his mouth open.
Unbelievable!
The ultimate in unprofessionalism!
