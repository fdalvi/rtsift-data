I love this nail shop so much!
Although you should book an appt.
ahead of time at  this nails salon.
It has the best prices, the best convo, very friendly nail techs too!
They have a very big selection of acrylic tips and special shellac colors, and hand printed designs to choose from.
alright enough said try them for yourself!

Wonderful place!
Friendly.
Great pedicure.
Good manicure.
Very clean

Love this nail salon.
I get white pedi, they come out perfect everytime!
Price Range is perfect!

Dirty,  and they took shortcuts to get me out the door quicker.
Very disappointing.
Given the other reviews I checked  out before I went here,  I expected a strong experience.
Unfortunately  it felt below average.
