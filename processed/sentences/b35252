Except for their overpriced beer and overpriced drinks.
this place is just ok.
I went a few times when they opened.
Nice place I was impressed at how nice it looked inside.
I asked the manager what was good there because my buddy and i were gonna get some chow.
i asked him about the nachos, he looked at me and said quitely... "DONT GET THOSE"... he told us the cheese tasted funky and he would never recommend those.
LOL.
we laughed at the fact this guy was trash talking his own bar.
This is the kinda place i would go to if there was absolutely nothing else going on around town.

Nice happy hr!
Nice big TV setup.
Food seems typical for a bar / restaurant .
I'll keep this place on my list and see if it improves with time.
Its pretty obvious that they just opened so I gave them a third star for potential rather than two stars they would get otherwise.
