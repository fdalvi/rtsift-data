Great spot near us to let Dolce run around...The field in this park is huge, and there's also a concrete walkway circling the field if you feel like taking a stroll.
During the Summer months, there is a water park section for the kids and a few picnic tables as well.
A great place for the families and their furry friends...ALOHA!!!
YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(124/365) "Dolce's Park"

This place has it all.
Jogging/walking trail, water feature for kids, playground, huge open field, shuffle board, picnic tables and it is never over populated shhhh.
I enjoy bringing my pom pom here and he gets extremely exited as soon as we pull up to the parking lot.
