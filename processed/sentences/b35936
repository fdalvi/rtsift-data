honest owner and mechanics, better try this shop to beleive !
i'm a filipino, we make sure that our mechanics are professional, honest and reliable.

Hands down best mechanic in town!
Just moved here from hawaii!
Been to other auto shops & have'd my car work on, it was good for a week or so then something else went wrong!
Went back & they want to charge me more to fix!
What a rip off!
So my wife coworker referred us to AMO AUTO SHOP they fixed the problem with quality parts & good price also the owner amo shows u what they change and show u your old parts they change out!
Really honest this owner No rip off here!
My auto shop for life!!!!

I've been going to Amos ever since I got my first car back when I was 16.
Amos himself is a really nice guy, honest and doesn't B.S.
you about what needs to be done to your car and how much it will cost.
He has been helping out my entire family for the past 12 years and we all get treated well whenever we have to go.
His main mechanic Marco is great too, he gets stuff done in a really timely manner and he'll let you know what he did and how to maintain everything so you're not leaving with any questions.
Great staff all around and the shop is great.
Prices are really fair and work is hands down the best in town.
GO TO AMOS!
