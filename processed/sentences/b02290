I really like the service at this location, it's much better than the Chandler mall location.
No matter how busy this place gets you are ALWAYS greeted with a smile and a free sample.
The staff is very knowledgeable about the product and the candy itself is consistently superb as expected.
When I want See's Candy this is where I go!

The sign says: "Closed 5/14 - 10/25"

NEVER GO HERE!
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS!!!!!!
I wish I could give this place 0 stars!!
We went in at 5:50 pm (mind you they close at 6pm), and as we were pulling in the employee put a closed sign on, and locked the doors!
I went up to the door and knocked, and the employee yelled "WE'RE CLOSED!
" I told her it wasn't even 6 o'clock but she didn't care and ignored us!!
It turned out she was the manager Sammy.
WHAT HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!
STAY AWAY!!
