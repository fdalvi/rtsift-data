Wonderful box with even better people.
Encouraging atmosphere here and you can meet some great friends.
Has an "at home" feel to it and it is run out of Chaparral Christian Church so they are a non-profit and therefore much cheaper as well!

Had a heck of a time finding a box that has flexible schedules, great coaches and get this CHILDCARE!
And not the, "heres a room to lock your kid in while you workout" childcare, but the OMG this is like my son staying with grandma for an hour childcare.
The community here truly wants you to succeed, not just by being able to lift heavy things, but also eat better, feel better and include your family and friends while doing it.
Thats right, I said community, because its not just a box!

The people here are really sweet and helpful.
They have a good, supportive, atmosphere.
Come in if you want to get your WOD on
