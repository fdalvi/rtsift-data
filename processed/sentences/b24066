My parents set up a savings account for me here when I was little.
And I'm so glad they did!
I have always gotten excellent customer service.
I now have saving and checking accounts as well as vehicle and home loans.
What I like is that the more services you have and the longer you have been with them, the more benefits you receive - including rate discounts.

Great customer service.
