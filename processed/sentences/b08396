What an undiscovered gem.
Incredibly fresh and tasty ranchero and pollo in their own marinade.
Best guac I've ever had.
We took it all to go and grilled the ranchero one night and the pollo the next.
Homemade rice and beans were wonderful also.
Plus, woman who worked the meat dept was so friendly and helpful.

This place rocks!
What an awesome find.
Got some carne asada on Friday for some family grilling on Sunday.
The marinade is fantastic, but he meat quality is outstanding.
The meat was well marbled and had most of the "silver skin" removed to make it significantly more tender than any carne asada I have ever had.
They have a pretty awesome deal for a family pack for $60 that seems well worth it.
Definitely having this again and very soon.
Staff is super friendly and the prices are crazy low for the quality you are getting.
Definitely a place to check out for your next party.

My friend turned me on to this place a few years ago and I've been hooked ever since!
Absolutely the best carne I've ever had and the service is great also.
I will be coming here as long as they are in business.
