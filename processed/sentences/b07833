Is there such a thing as a QT that's not ridiculously busy?
If so, it's not this one just a bit west of 43rd Avenue on West Indian School Road.
Lives up to it's billing with always competitive-to-lower gas prices, clean store, abundant beverage selection from coffees to soft-drinks to beer, and a generous offering of ready to eat or heat'n'eat convenient-if-not-always-healthy foodish items as well.
Always neat & efficient staff is trained to greet you as you come through the door, which must get close to impossible given the volume passing through at various times, and which may well be a perfunctory bore to the young people working there - but which I appreciate for myself, and for good training for them.
Up to $40 cash back on debit card purchases with no surcharge, a great convenience.
Upped my star rating - I AM a fan of clean convenience!

This place is awesome, love getting my coffee here in the mornings during graves.
Staff is always friendly.
Would recommend to anyone.

I get in and out fast, with them living up to their name Quick Trip.
Even when they are busy (always a plus).
The employees are, kind and courteous and always doing something around the store (Usually cleaning).
Most items they sale are cheep.
Just not the beef jerky,  it is overly expensive.
