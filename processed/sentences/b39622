So much fun!
Can't wait to do it again!
What a wonderful night!

So much fun!
Got this on living social for a friends birthday and didn't know what to expect.
We ran a little late but the instructor was amazing and so sweet!
We had such an awesome time we hadn't even left and were already talking about how we had to come back.
Best of all I not only shocked myself with my unknown art skills everyone loves my painting:)

My office had a mobile party as part of our holiday celebration and it was exceptionally well run and everyone had a great time.
They bring everything you need, including drop cloths, aprons an easels.

We had a great time and will be back.
I definitely recommend trying this place out.

I took my mom on a play date to Your Art Party - we both had SO MUCH FUN!!!!!
The artist, Michelle, who led us through creating the painting was GREAT!
I felt completely at ease.
I was given enough direction to feel comfortable, and enough freedom to make my picture "my own".
I loved seeing how different all of the paintings were at the end of the class, and really enjoyed getting to know the other people there.
I posted about this experience on my FB page and have already responded to several requests for more information about Your Art Party - I'm excited to do this again!
:-)
