Attended Mass last weekend.
It's held in a building that resembles a school meeting hall rather than a church.
It was a nice service.....friendly community.
I felt welcome here, however I prefer a more traditional church environment.

Very nice people where warm and you had a welcome feeling .
The Paster is young and very nice.

Now that football season has started, I looked for another church that has 8 am mass, so I can get back home in time for the 10 am games....yeah yeah, I know.
I hadn't been here in 2 yrs, but over the past 2 weekends, I've come here for the 8 am mass and became a fan of Fr.
Parks.
His homilies are spot on and relevant to today's problems and gave me food for thought.
So while I was brought here for different reasons, I'm glad I did because I got so much more out of it.

It is my opinion that it really doesn't matter where you worship, pray, and sing to God.
Anywhere is all the same.
This place is small and homey.
it looks like it's attached to some kind of school, which is nice if you have kids.
The people are pretty nice.
I did notice that there was no place to kneel however, so no kneeling here!
I was only visiting and leaving Sunday, so the mass I attended was at 5pm on Sat!
