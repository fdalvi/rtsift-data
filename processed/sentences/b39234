This place is on the first floor of the building I work in and is very convenient to go here since all I need to do is go down stairs.
It is a little on the pricier side of comparable places but that is what you get for convenience.
The smoothies are pretty good.
Most lunch items are decent.
I generally go here in the mornings to get a breakfast burro.
I get the sausage burro with a spinach tortilla.
Pretty good.
Overall, if you don't mind the price I say give it a try.

Nice little Deli.
Sandwich was really good and just the right size.
Did have some trouble getting it as clerk rang up wrong sandwich so had to wait to get correct one.
Also took a long time to get food.
Was about 12:30 so busier but still not very quick.
Prices are reasonable and lots of other stuff to buy.
Kind of a mini convenience store.
Staff friendly and helpful.
Odd location in office building with no exterior marking that it is there.
Work in nearby building and another employee told me about it.
Never would have seen it otherwise.
Will definitely go back as it is close enough to walk, good food that is healthier than other options and priced fair.

After a second visit and again waiting over 15 minutes to get food (a burger) and when I finally asked it turns out sandwich was one of two I had watched be placed on back counter 10 minutes prior and ignored while taking additional orders.
Place was busy at 1pm on a Friday and seemed understaffed.
Food is excellent, prices fair and staff polite but unless you have lots if time to wait you might be disappointed.
I will probably not be back unless coming with another group.

Dirty looking employees that wear sweat pants and can't be bothered to take care of their hair.
Food is often times not as requested.
Expensive, not the best quality.
Good for convenience but I feel like I was ripped off every time I order from here.
