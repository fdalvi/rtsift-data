I had to reschedule last minute on a weekend it was not an issue for them.
I had them come fix my garage door sensors very knowledgeable and friendly as well the price was really good as well would recomend for your garage repairs

Last weekend, my garage door would only go up partway and was making some pretty questionable sounds besides.
The business listed the sticker on my garage door was no longer in business, so I tried Western Door and Gate.
I called at 9 in the morning and they said they could have someone out to look at it between 3 and 5.
The repairman showed up a little after four, took one look inside the garage and said that it was a broken spring.
He said he had the tools and could fix it right then -- $295.
The work was done in about twenty minutes.
He also offered me a garage door remote ($38) and since I had lost one of the two I had, I was happy to add that on.

Called them about getting a quote for a complete installation, tech came out and took some measurements and said the door size was non standard and no room inside garage to install opener components.
He suggested I look into getting a roll up door, so I asked for a quote on that.
He said he would get back to me, two days go by and I call their office.
They said, "Oh let me look into that, I'll call you back".
Never heard from them.
I believe they are more interested in simple repairs than real installation projects.
