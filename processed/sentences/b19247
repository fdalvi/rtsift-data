Went here when I was in Kitchener, Ontario visiting an old buddy from back in the day.
Food was decent, wings were breaded, not my preference.
Hot though.
Pricey for the quality, $15+ for a wings dinner in a little college town.

The wings here are of excellent quality.
You have a choice of original (which I prefer) or breaded (which they tell me is the popular choice).
There are plenty of flavours as well; dry rub, such as west coast, and your usual mild, medium, hot.
Then there is sweet Thai.
I just mentioned the ones I enjoyed.
You can also ask for them sloppy.
The Wings Up is expensive buy worth it for really great wings and courteous service.

Okay, I haven't eaten here in about 2 years, but boy, do I miss those wings.
Their medium sauce was perfect for me, didn't taste like the usualy "Franks Red Hot" but had a tangy-ness to it and it was hot, but not too hot that I couldn't eat them.
Yum!
I always ordered mine breaded and extra sloppy.
I love the veggies and ranch they would give.
They are a bit pricey but trust me, it's worth it!

Love the wings - tried several of the hotter flavors.
