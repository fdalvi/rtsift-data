My mother has been in Sante for 14 days now.
We chose Sante' after going to several facilities.
It is first and foremost, an excellent care facility with occupational and physical therapy every day for rehabilitation with a very well equipped gym.
There is speech therapy for cognitive reinforcement.
Group activities help round out the very long recovery days.
Additionally, there is a chef that makes meals to order with a menu that varies from day to day and the food is very good.
The building, dining room, and client rooms are set up as a very warm and lovely hotel.
However....the best part of this facility is certainly the staff!
The staff from administration, nursing, assistants, therapy, chef, hosts, servers,social staff, transportation, and cleaning  ALL have a smile on their faces and GREET you and address ones concerns or questions immediately.
Our family has been so impressed with their apparent concern and attention.
We would name people that have been so great to my mother and to our family but we simply would not know where to start as the entire facility has been more than stellar!
We are so grateful that all of them have taken such great care of our precious mother.

"What a surprise!
When I heard "Rehab" - never could I envision this - Rm - super - Bed - comfy!
Staff above reproach - helpful - courteous - "Rehab" - unbelievable - a staff with "you" the focus - I have mild COPD - The goal - go home No O2 + back on my feet - driving our car.
Please look at Sante  1st.That's where you or your loved one will want to be.
Oops - forgot - food!
1st CLASS+.

Everybody is very friendly  and helpful.
Our  Uncle  Jerry was there for  about 4 weeks following a stroke.
Unfortunately Sante is only a short term care and he had to be moved to a long term care facility.
It will be very difficult for any other nursing care to measure up to the treatment he, and all of  his friends and family received from Sante.
Highly recommended!
