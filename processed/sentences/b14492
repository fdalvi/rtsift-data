Slow service inside.
Somewhat rude cashier, and for no reason.
Small and awkward layout inside, especially for the limited seating and limited standing area to take an order.
Sub-par as far as McDonalds go.

This is a convenient location near the Cobblestone Gas/Car Wash inside the Walmarts near the 101/FLW Blvd exit.
The service is good, the food is ... well McDonalds good, and it's a good place to wait for your car next door at Cobblestone or Discount tires!
Enjoy!

I don't really fast food but I love the McDonald's hot fudge sundae.
It's $1.30 and really hits the spot for something sweet.

I've been to the McDonald's a few times, only through the drive thru.
What's really  impressive is that they have a double drive thru, which means there's 2 ordering lanes that converge back into 1, so you can process orders twice as fast.
What's impressive is that to keep up, they have to get the food ready at twice the speed.
I'm not sure why this particular location does this, but it's pretty cool....I've never seen anything like that before.
The food here is average McDonald's food....nothing much to really talk about.
I stop here to grab Breakfast on occasion when I'm on the go and nearby.
