We went here today for the first time after my hot dog loving boyfriend had been talking about it.
They have a great menu including things I've never heard of.
So that's fun.
The place was small and plain but clean.
Order at the counter and they'll bring it to you.
I think the workers are probably all related.
Nice family business.
The food.
Oh my goodness, the bread.
I had a Sonoran hot dog and the roll was amazing.
The hot dog and toppings was not lacking, but seriously, the bread.
So good.
We also got a carne asada burrito and the meat was yummy.
We waited a couple minutes for our food, but I think that's because quality takes an extra minute.
I can't wait to go back.

I was searching for a place that served Sonoran Hot Dogs and this place came up on my phone.
My friend just moved here from back east and he's been wanting to try local Arizona dishes.
I'm glad I picked this place for his first Sonoran Hot Dog experience.
The bun was soft and the whole thing was covered in fresh grated cheese.
It tasted awesome.
The fries were also fresh and they gave us complimentary chips and salsa.
We'll be back again.

Good authentic Sonoran hot dogs.
Prices for the burros were a little high but were tasty.
Would frequent again.
