If they don't have what you want, they'll find you one.
My family has purchased two vehicles from these guy's over the past few years.
Reliable used cars at good prices.
Looking for a newer vehicle for Mom.
Ask for Heath!

Would definitely buy again from them...
Ask for heath.....
Completely impressed with their lack of typical used car salesman stigma...impressed!!!!
Thank you for everything....

Just bought from these guys and was extremely satisfied.
The price was very fair ($4000 for an '04 ford ranger) and they were very friendly and cooperative.
They even took my broken down old car for a trade in.
If I need a car in the future, I'll be back talking to these guys before I look on craigslist.
