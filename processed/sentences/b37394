Katia is AMAZING.
I have been brazilian waxing for more than 13 years.
I have a sensitive bikini area and am prone to ingrowns which have gotten worse recently.
My friends told me about sugaring and I figured I would try it.
I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO WAXING.
Sugaring is far less painful and the irritation is wayyyyy less.
Additionally Katia explained everything, gave upkeep tips, was quick and efficient.
I highly recommend getting sugared by Katia!

I started seeing Katia a little over a year ago.
At first, I chose my own facials from the list of services, but within the first couple of months, I learned that Katia's recommendations can always be trusted.
Now, I simply make an appointment and ask, "What are we doing today?
"  I've tried many of her body treatments also.
I particularly recommend dermaplaning and the crystalline masque facial.

I wont get facials with anyone but Katia!
She's Fantastic!!
I had major skin issues to the point where I was beginning to give up.
Bi-monthly visits with Katia changed my skin completely.
Thank you Katia, you are amazing!
