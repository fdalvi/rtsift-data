I've worked with Chelsea at Office Team on a number of occasions to fill openings in several departments and she provides great service and top-notch candidates every time.
This is not an agency that's going to harrass you about moving faster on candidates.
They are patient and flexible to the clients needs.
Office Team is one of the first agencies I check with any time we have an opening.

I have worked with Chelsea Buhrt and Office Team on several occasions and every single time they have come through quickly with great candidates for difficult positions.
She was also patient with me and helped me in refining my needs for some positions that were a little harder to fill.
Absolutely LOVE Office Team.

I have worked with Office Team for many years.
I have always been fortunate to obtain great positions with them.
Although it may take some time, if you are patient and persistent, they will assist you in finding employment.
The team in Chandler and Camelback are great with matching you with opportunities that fit your needs and experience.
I will always be Team OfficeTeam!
