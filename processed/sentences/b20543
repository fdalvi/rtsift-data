If you're a sporty character then you will find pretty much every kind of clothing you could every need here.
Stocking the big sporting names such as Adidas, Nike, Puma and Reebok whether it's some swimming googles or running shorts you'll always have a selection here.
Plus, if you have a snapfax, you get 10% off!
Awesome.

Acne-ridden and uncomfortable in my own skin, I actually worked in JJB for a short while just after leaving school.
While it would be a damning indictment upon myself to refer to the period as "the glory days", having a few quid in my pocket whilst still being too young to give a shit about anything isn't actually a bad way to be at all.
Organising baseball caps into size order, watching shoplifters do their handiwork, and begging low-income parents to take out a criminally expensive storecard was about all I had to do, and it doesn't seem the store has changed much over the years.
Fair play to them for selling actual sports stuff as well as skillseeker uniforms.

This place gets a bit of a bad name.
It's not chavvy really....let's just take it for what it is.
It's a sports shop, it sells sporty things.
You can get most basic sporting items here - gym clothes, running shoes, hoodies etc, it's all here.
So what, you might get mugged when you're there, it's still good for what it is and what it costs.
