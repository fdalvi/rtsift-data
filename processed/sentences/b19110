Gas prices are a little competitive, and the cooler is stocked well with what little space they have, and the coffee is always available.
This is a very old site, and grungy, but the people are nice.
I do not know why this gas station charges above market for gas.

Dirty location.
5 gas pumps were broken, 3 were tagged out of service.
This location is poorly maintained.

Open 24/7.
I just have to say every time we come here the girls that work inside are very nice and if they get a chance they will talk with you.
Since they see us at least once a week we talk more.
It always is clean inside and they are usually stalked up on drinks and snacks etc.
Of course we will be back.
