They have a really big selection, and I loved that they used nice fresh looking fruit.
The only issue that I had is that usually you can find on the menu a "lighter" smoothie... you know,non fat milk, sweetened with splenda, or just not adding extra sugar.
Didn't really see that on the menu.
I'm sure they can make it that way, but still, I want it to be nice and obvious for me.
I guess I'm just spoiled like that.
The Acai smoother I got was great, hit the spot perfectly.

Always crave this place and I never get tired of it either.
