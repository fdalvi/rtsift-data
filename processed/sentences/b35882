This Gurudwara Sahib is only 10-15 minutes away from Las Vegas Strip and 5 minutes away from the airport.
The head priest was really nice and offered us refreshments.
There is another Sikh Temple "Gurudwara Baba Deep Singh" which is 30 minutes away.

Great place to get grounded and cenetered,,,

Unlike what the yelp category states, this is a Sikh temple, not a Hindu temple.
The place is hard to find, as it sits on a residential corner with a lot of shrubbery in front and a rather short nishan sahib (orange flag indicating it is a house of Sikh worship).
Good luck finding parking in their tiny lot, you will most likely have to park on the adjacent street and walk back to the temple.
There is a space in the fence you can walk through so you don't have to go all the way back to Russel and enter that way.
There are double doors on one side of the building, but don't try to enter that way; the actual entry is on the south side past the kitchen.
This is an old house that was converted into the open community rooms you'll find today.
Be forewarned that there is no air conditioner and little shade outside of the building.
Make sure you stay hydrated before visiting!
Service starts around 12:30, although a lot of people come earlier for snacks beforehand.
Always make sure that you take off your shoes at the back entry, where they have a huge shoe rack, and cover your head before entering.
There are separated men and women's restrooms through a door on the left just after entering.
The entry room serves as a tiny langar hall, although they have a couple folded tables set out under a makeshift porch.
There is a cute little altar inside the main room.
After services are over, people turn the main room into a temporary langar hall and serve food to the seated.
I don't know how appropriate the method is, but the place is tiny, so I guess they do with what they have.
