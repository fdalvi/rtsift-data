Had a coupon they sent me via email.
They said I couldn't use it for my car cause it not the right oil that my car uses or that they have been putting in won't go here again

$40 dollars plus tax for a oil change??
I think not.
Drove less than half a mile down the road got it done 19.99 plus tax.
Wont be returning and will be recommending people to stay away.

Good job guys!
5 star service.
In and out under an hour!
Reasonable pricing.
Change the oil and flushed the transmission on my company's van.
Special thanks to Peter & Scott.
They was polite, and honest.
The shop looked very clean.
That tells a lot about a mechanical automotive shop.
