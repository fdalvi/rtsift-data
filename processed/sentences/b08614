We took a queue from the "Best of" series this weekend and checked out this little local sandwich and pizza place.
As a rule, I'm generally not into sandwich places (see also: my review of Duck and Decanter).
When the gf suggested it, I wasn't excited about the prospect of another eight dollar sandwich spilling over with strange greens that tasted like feet.
However, on this occasion I obliged.
When we arrived, my first reaction was to be impressed by the setup.
There is a cool little fountain just outside in the corner (of the strip mall) and for a warm spring day, it was perfect.
Inside, there was an older couple that apparently could sense that we were first-timers and were quick to assure us that we were "in for a treat.
"   We both ordered sandwiches that were good, surprisingly good, and flavorful.
I ordered a chicken sandwich with bacon and carmelized onions and it came out after a short wait with a side of mixed greens in a light dressing.
I'm definitely planning a second visit to check out their pizza (I saw some white pizzas being cooked that looked dee-lish) and maybe another sandwich or two, as well.
So far, so good.

Really, really nice people but not spectacularly good food.
Pretty inexpensive and interesting.
Strange kinds of pizza that are pretty awesome and some good salads.

I think this place is CLOSED.
Their # is out of service.
