They have been cutting my hair for 30 yrs, great spot.

I needed a haircut during our vacation and stumbled on this old fashioned barber shop.
Jan is the owner and operator.
He provided one of the best haircuts I have had in many years and I will be a returning customer.

On vacation, friend needed a haircut, found this barber, great customer service, prices very reasonable.
On top a very clean cut.
Def made this our go to place for future Vegas visits.

Been going to Jan for 10 years.
I don't go anywhere else.
He works limited days but takes appointments.
Walk ins are taken, but Jan is usually booked.
