This is the best pharmacy in Arizona.They make getting your prescription filled a good experience.My family loves going there.They are always saving us money and go out of there way to make sure we understand how to take the medicne.This is why we need to support our small bussinesses.They really care about your family.

A lot quicker and friendlier to deal with as compared to ANY Pharmacy.

This is a great gem.
A cute little quaint pharmacy.
And the staff are very knowledgable and helpful.
It's surprising from all the chaos from big chains.
Great staff, convenient location, surprisingly calm surrounding.
Very nice.
Yes I think I shall come back.
