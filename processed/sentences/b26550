No one speaks English.
Place is disgustingly dirty.
Service it terrible along with the food.
We had papusas which were good and quesdilla which was good.
But I am afraid now for food poisoning.
We will never go back there again.
And yes I was sick later that day From the food

The pork pupusas are heaven and practically melt in your mouth.
The prices are GREAT!
You have to try this place at least once.

OK, being Salvadorian and coming from Los Angeles,  i went to this place in search of some delicious, authentic Salvi (Salvadorian) food.
This place has delicious food, that actually tastes like Salvadorian food.
I didn't, however, like the service much.
They took for ever to help me, take my order and bring the food.
The server, .a female that's always there, wasn't very attentive either.
If you're looking for some good authentic food, and are patient then you will like the place.
Their food was delicious.
I ate "machaca con huevo" breaklefast style.
I highly recommend this place.

This place is awesome!
I live in Henderson and don't get to make it as often as I would like but anytime I'm in that area I make sure to go here to eat!
I've never been anything less than extremely satisfied!

I don't normally write reviews, but I believe this restaurant deserves one.
it is one of vegas' hidden gems.
The food was amazing and the ambiance was wonderful.
The traditional Salvadorian horchata that they make here is by far the best I've ever tasted.
The food was impeccable.
Quite fulfilling and totally worth the trip.
