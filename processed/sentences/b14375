Is a clean toilet seat too much to ask?
How about working lighting fixtures?
Carpets without crusty white stains?
Just shy of $100 a night?
Really?

I would give this hotel 0 stars, but that is not an option.
It took nearly 3 hours to check in due to a communication problem with Expedia (another subject of a terrible review).
Their fax machine did not work and the clerk was content to say that if he did not get a fax, I could not check on.
Once I did get checked in, I asked for an extra blanket, and the same clerk informed me that housekeeping had locked everything up and he had no access.
The room was what you would expect for the price, no frills.
The service made it a bad experience.
Don't waste your money ... sleep in your car if this hotel is the only option.
