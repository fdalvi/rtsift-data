Rory and Kristen take care of you like family!
AND they take care of your car too!
I have never had a problem with the fixing my car...and it is ALWAYS cheaper than the next place.
They care about their customers and want you satisfied with the work that they do.

Thanks Jon for the great service on my Lexus.
Your thorough checkup gave me confidence for a safe drive to Florida.

This is my go to place for any car related issue.
Very knowledgable, friendly, and honest.
What more can you ask for?

Great shop, honest mechanics, fair pricing and easy to work with.
I love that it have found this family owned business and am happy to support them with all my car maintenance needs.
I absolutely loathe any car maintenance stuff and Rory and Jon made it feel so hassle free and affordable.
Thanks for taking such great care of my car.

My family and I been going to Rory's for 10 years and there is a reason why - because this place is amazing.
The service is phenomenal; they treat you like a client as oppose to a transaction (they do a remarkable job at building rapport with their customers).
They take pride in their work simply because it's quality.
They are honest, reasonably priced and it's the only time I have ever been to an auto repair place where I did not feel like i was being taken advantage of.

After years of using the superstition springs Lexus dealer ship I decided to use Rory's.
The estimate I got from the dealer ship was considerably more expensive than Jon at Rory's quoted me.
I needed a lift to work after dropping my car at Rory's, Rory himself was kind enough to give me a lift to work as well as pick me up.The service was certainly 5+ star as well as the quotes and work that needed to be done.
They work on most makes and models and have all kind of cool cars in there garage
