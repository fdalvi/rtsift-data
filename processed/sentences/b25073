It's no LoLo's but it got me over a fried chicken craving, I'd give this 2.5 stars if I could.
I don't think KFC is as good as it used to be, but hard to say since my palate has certainly refined over the years.
The gal at the drive thru was very friendly, so there's my bonus .5 star.

Can they be any slower???
Seriously.
The only thing you can really review a KFC for is how good the service is.
This one, the line of customers is ten deep, there are three people standing around the kitchen, and the cashier that behaves like she just learned to think.
It did not help that all the customers had to discuss practically every menu item in detail.
I almost bagged it, but 20 minutes later, I headed out with my dinner.
Damn, I wish there were a Popeyes around here!

I can just imagine all the hardships that those fabled explorers Lewis & Clark had to endure as they explored the unchartered West of the USA from 1804 to 1806.
Harsh weather conditions and long hunting expeditions in search of food.
In my quest for sustenance today I ventured out to the local KFC to bag some chicken.
It was like watching a movie scene in slow motion as it took probably close to 10 minutes before I received my food.
Yeah, we've come a long way since 1806 where they could only wish to even capture any food within 10 minutes.
In addition, I guess since the outdoor air temperature is only 89 they didn't feel like it was worthy to turn on the air conditioning.
There was no air flow with fans, it was stifling in the restaurant.
Now the food did taste great but there is plenty of room left to improve the customer service and ambience of this place.
