Mark and his team at Auto Glass Perfection did a great job for me.
I had about 5 small chips in my window and Mark suggested repair vs. replace.
I thought "what the heck, if that's what you think", not realizing he was saving me a ton of dough and making my windshield perfect.
I appreciate his integrity and follow thru and will happily refer business when given the opportunity.
Thanks for your help Mark!

Awesome company!
Mark (owner) is one of the nicest and knowledgeable people in the industry.
AG is built on customer service and providing a great value!
Totally recommend!

AG Perfection is an amazing company.
We had a crack in our windshield, so we called AG Perfection to see if they could help us out with this.
Mark was very friendly and helpful, answering all the questions I had.
I will call AG Perfection for any of my auto glass repairs!
