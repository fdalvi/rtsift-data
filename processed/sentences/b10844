How do you make italian food taste bad?
Just add a lot of salt...but this place adds just the right amount of spices to flavor your order.
nice venue and good food...worth a try.

We have been going to Las Vegas for 10 years at least 3 times a year we have stayed at Caesers Palace, MGM Signature and had almost given up on Vegas until we decided to try the Palazzo and wow wow wow what a great time we got a free upgrade on our room overlooking Treasure Island and the strip and we loved this placed from room service, to the shopping, to the entire staff unreal experience and we are definitely going back.
Loved our stay great gym and just alot to do right on location the staff made it the most enjoyable time ever.
Great Great Time and what an exceptional room.

Love this Hotel.
I have stayed almost everywhere in Vegas.This time we had decided to get a Suite in The Palazzo, hadn't stayed there before so hey why not.
The suite was exceptionally nice, with a sunken in living room with sectional, perfect view of pools, the beds were amazingly comfortable with plenty of pillows, bathroom was large and spacious had plenty of room to get ready (girls trip- 4 of us).
The elevator was near by and literally drops you right near the center of the casino, so no need to walk miles(in heels) to this wing or that wing.
We had brunch downstairs at LAVO!
Another 5 star breakfast!
Overall loved my stay there, the d√©cor is also very nice, staff is friendly and helpful.
I will stay here again!
