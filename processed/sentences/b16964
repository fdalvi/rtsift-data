** UPDATE  06-05-08 *** I get detailed bills emailed in PDF that lets me archive what work was done when...
It goes into my gmail so its one component of my house set on cruise control  ** Update 1-31-07** Still sparkles.
I wanted to come back to a bad pool so I could Yelp poke them in the eye... no such luck.
Pool was crystal clean   ** Update 11-25-07** still very clean and very professional I have had turnover but management stays on top of it  ** Update ** xPools is everything that AZ should be a) professional.
Not just flakey b) tech savvy.
We're not talking complete CRM adoption but how about a working website and email c) phone-a-riffic.
People like to talk to people that answer the phone.
d) prosperous.
Maybe in the future, someone like Michael or Roger would Blockbuster-ize the pool service industry.
Maybe in the FAR future, when the chlorine level drops cuz my dog went for a swim, my pool filter would fire off an SMS (that's a text message for you people over 30) to me and the pool guy to add chemical.
But in the present, X-Pools does a great job.
*** Update OVER  ***  So I just fired my pool guy.
Ken (Mr Green Pool) at 623 640 1900, abandoned my pool.
He operated under the legal name "Kleanwise".
He was as good at pool management as he was at spelling.
Then I called Coral Pool for a month with no returns of calls at 480-831-7932.
Kim, Ava, and David run a shoddy operation  Then I called about a dozen pool companies during my work day.
Finally, I get a google paid listing,  "Scottsdale Pool Service www.x-pools.net       Superior Pool Maintenance Service 1 Month Free.
Call: (480) 945 2486  Wallahh!
Ihave a huge clean pool.
http://www.x-pools.net/index.html Roger Meyer at, 480-945-2486, was professional courteous and prompt.
They should charge more for the extra services they provide.
Kudos to you for using ad-words to land me as a customer and for adopting email/sms to communicate with me on pool related issues.

Michael Dennis and his team have always been extremely helpful and professionl when I have pool problems I can't solve myself.
I can always count on X-Pools to go the extra mile to get things done!
