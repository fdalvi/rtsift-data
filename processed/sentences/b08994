As Arby's go, this one is a bit above the rest.
The manager clearly keep s a positive work environment which means people actively doing their job and making a pleasant experience for the customers.
The food is always on that "pretty good" side of what fast food can be.

This Arby's is one if e cleanest I have seen.
