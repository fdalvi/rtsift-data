I like Tropical Smoothie Cafe and if you work anywhere near family court, you MUST be as excited as I am that this place opened!!
I went on April 25, and I think it had just opened the day before or something like that.
It was crowded (see the aforementioned excitement at this place opening near family court) but well staffed.
I think they were still working out some bugs as everyone ordered PRETTY MUCH the same thing yet the prices were ALL OVER THE BOARD, but I do think they will get this worked out.
The food was good, the smoothies were great, and I am hopeful the service will follow!

Like it so far it's new something that else to add besides Starbucks lol to my visits

This place is new, very clean and it is nice had a 24 drive through.
People are also nice and friendly great place to stop by and get a drink.

I love tropical smooth.
Its affordable and has great service.
