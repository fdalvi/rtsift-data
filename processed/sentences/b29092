Me and a friend were walking back from a game of laser-tag, which was just around the corner when this little shop caught our eye.
We were first attracted to the shop by its name- and we wondered what it was all about.
Looking at the window there was a special deal on for two Chinese teas for £3.99 and thought that this was a pretty good offer for trying something new.
I ordered a Kung Fu black tea- and it was advertised as helping you to lead a healthy life and bring about a peaceful mind- a lot more than what Tetley's promise!
I must admit that I found the tea to taste absolutely awful, you could say it was not my cup of tea!
However, I am happy that I went there, just to say that I have tried Chinese tea, and it only cost me £2, so I would definitely recommend anyone to come here and give it a try.

Popped in here at the weekend for a tea ceremony and it was a very interesting and enjoyable experience.
The range of teas on offer is formidable but there's definitely something for all tastes.
Of the ones I sampled my personal favourite was the Red Robe Oolong.
Nicely decorated and with the charming owner in attendance this is a specialist shop that deserves to prosper.
I think the tea ceremonies are only being undertaken at weekends currently so probably best to call and book in advance.
The shop also has a Facebook page.
