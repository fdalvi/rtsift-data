i have never been treated so rude.
owner has anger issues!
do not give this store your business.

It's such a bright, whimsical place, it's fun just to wander around and "discover" treasures in the store.
I LOVE my MacKenzie Childs purchase and was very pleased with the service...attentive, but not hovering...helpful and friendly.
All in all, a great experience.

My favorite place to shop for gifts & home decor.
They always have something unique & of course their collection of Mackenzie-Childs is huge.
Such a fan!

Such a beautiful store!
My favorite place to shop for MacKenzie-Childs and gifts for over 20 years.
Everyone is always so nice and helpful!
A must go if you're in the Phoenix area.
