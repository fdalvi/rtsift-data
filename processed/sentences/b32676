Living in Tucson, this is the gas station I always stop at before returning home when I'm in the Phoenix area.
Usually, it's just to grab a snack, something to drink, and a little gas.
I like it's location as one of the last places to stop before leaving the Phoenix area if you are traveling Eastbound on I-10.
It is very close to the on and off ramp.
Bathrooms aren't that large or spectacular.

It's got cheap prices on smokes there bathrooms are meh hit or miss if its clean or not depends

Don't really know this place just stopped to fuel up and get some ice for the stuff we brought back from Hawaii for my sister, but it's a hit or miss stop .. Looks like a great place to stop if your thirsty and need some snacks
