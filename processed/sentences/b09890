We used the Union Hills for our wedding reception:  Ben and JJ Bella Catering team were AMAZING!
We had our reception at the Union Hills Country Club run by JJ Bella.
The facility is beautiful but the staff and the service we received was what set them apart.
Ben worked with us and had creative suggestions to help us stay within our budget and we ended up getting far more than we thought we could.
The great thing about the Union Hills Country Club and JJ Bella Catering was that nothing was a no.
They worked with us to get everything that we were hoping for with our wedding.
The day before the wedding I dropped off all our decorations (and we had a lot) and let the staff know how I would like everything.
The day of the wedding it was EXACTLY as I had requested.
Walking into my reception and having it be perfect made me the happiest bride!The staff was extremely efficient and helpful, we never waited on anything.
The food was delicious and we received a lot of compliments from our guests on both the reception and the service.
I would recommend JJ Bella and Union Hills Country Club for weddings and any other event that you would need a reception hall for.
We will certainly use them in the future whenever the opportunity arises.
