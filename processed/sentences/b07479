I needed to have some wall-to-wall carpet replaced, so checked out a few Phoenix area sellers on the 'Net, & narrowed it down to three to visit & ask for a price quote.
I saw Chantel Miller at Contractor's Carpet, Steve Kaplan at Floors R Us, & Betty Bentley at Bentley Carpet.
All three were friendly & helpful, & the Shaw carpet I selected at Contractor's was also available at the other two places (although each store has it's own name for the product).
I chose Bentley for these reasons:  *  The carpet I wanted was available IN STOCK!
Both of the others would     have had to order it in from GA with an approximate 10-day wait, plus     scheduling the installation.
*  Bentley offered me the lowest price!
My quotes varied about $50 per     room between the lowest & highest total cost for identical product.
I paid a deposit & told Betty Bentley I would call after I finished doing some painting in the rooms.
When I called (early in the morning) they were able to schedule my installation for the SAME DAY!
Friendly installers Mario & his helper showed up ON TIME & did a terrific job installing my carpeting, & I love it!
5-Stars for Bentley Carpet?
Of course!
Hours:  M-F 6 AM to 2 PM.
==================== 6/18/09 Update:  Called Bentley this morning to see about another carpeting job here at the villa.
...Again received an excellent quote & entirely 5-Star service including SAME-DAY INSTALLATION from installer Larry!
I love this place, & my new carpeting!
==================== 7/28/09 Update:  Had Bentley out again to carpet a couple more rooms.
Installer Larry arrived right on time & I received another excellent installation at a very reasonable price.
5-Stars again!

I was very impressed with their prompt, courteous service.
They were very helpful in the selection process.
Installation was coordinated well and done expertly.
I will recommend them highly.

My husband and I just got our carpet re-done from Bentley Carpet and they were amazing!!
Richard and Richard Jr. came over at 8:00 in the morning and were done by 2:00.
They arrived in the time frame they said they would and when they walked in they got straight to work.
Both of the guys were really nice and friendly and talked to me about how to make our carpet last longer and look new for longer.
When they left there was absolutely no mess at all and everything looked amazing!
They vacuumed the carpets and everything.
I was so excited and everything went faster and smoother than I could have imagined and we are going to use them to install the new tile in our bathrooms as well!
I highly recommend Bentley Carpet.

I'm an out of state owner of some property and had some horrible experiences with Scott (owner).
Very slow to reply to updates/quotes...that's when they decide to even reply.
I would save the headaches and find another vendor who provides better service
