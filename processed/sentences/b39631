Glen, owner of Vantage, is a very detail oriented and caring insurance broker.
He's extremely responsive and quick to get back to you with answers.
Once when I blew out a tire on the freeway late on a Friday night, he called the towing company for me and then came out to wait with me.
He stayed until everything was taken care of.
Couldn't ask for a more dedicated person to have on your team.

Glen is a breath of fresh air in the world of insurance agents.
Not only does he know more about insurance than anybody ever should, but he is there when the need arises.
If you get in a car accident, or something in your attic starts pouring water through the ceiling, the last thing you want is to leave a voicemail for your insurance company.
Glen is by far the most responsive agent I know.
I've referred multiple people to Glen, and only heard great things, call him!
