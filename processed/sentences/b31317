Isn't it BAD ENOUGH that we poor citizens of coastal California SUFFER the indignities of an onslaught of ZONIES from Arizona every summer?
They drive slow like old ladies, are endlessly confused about traffic, and gobble up precious beach parking spaces that should otherwise go to tax-paying San Diego residents!
I won't even get started on their white, gross bodies.
What else does that desert hell have to offer us here?
The manufacturer and management of RED LIGHT CAMERAS!
Yes, that is right, ATS is the ARIZONA company that runs the City of San Diego's Red Light Camera show!
Another SLAP IN THE FACE  to San Diego FROM Cactus-ville!
The City of San Diego Traffic website states: "To adequately enforce traffic signal laws, we use red light photo enforcement.
Police officers cannot be everywhere at once.
" The City strategically mentions this also: "The (Red Light Photo System) RLPS system is a technology that records serious traffic violations the moment they occur.
Cameras are used to photograph only vehicles that run red lights in targeted areas.
Officers then review the film and a traffic citation is then issued to the vehicles' registered owner through the mail.
"   Now I have been to Traffic Court trying to get out a ticket (not Red Light) and I have seen the anger and rage that these Red Light tickets bring out in otherwise normal people.
In fact, most of the cases that I witnessed in Traffic Court were offenses related to camera tickets.
They are very controversial.
Most of the thugs that live at my apartment complex simply take off (or cover up) their front license plates to remove the threat of a photo ticket.
Why?
The cost of the citation in San Diego varies, based on your driving record.
Citations for running a red light are a minimum of $480.
They are a hassle to fight and some require the services of a lawyer-another negative point against ATS!
I offer only 2 YELP STARS for this program because, although the intentions are honorable, (to prevent traffic accidents) there are still too many problems and questions still associated with this program.
I am all for doing things to stop bad drivers from causing accidents but a lot of them manage to slip through the system.
ATS is just another Arizona scam to come out of the Great State of Hotter than Hell to bite San Diegans on their (toned & tanned) rears!

Please Please, save your money.
I called them with the assurance they have had  80 -85% success with camera tickets.
Within a couple of days of payment, the packet arrieved for me to send to the court.
After reading the packet - the best I could understand, it just seemed like boiler plate for the situation.
I called ATS, I was ASSURED it was not boiler plate and specific.
- which I really can't  debate as I am not a lawyer.
BUT - to come up with so many pages and photos so quickly, I have to question the specifics of the situation.
Belated common sense says that this camera is there for entrapment and the city is not going to give up a hefty fine, because it got a pile of legalize in the mail.
One would do better to show up and try to defend themselves.
The cameras are not for safety, they are to entrap - go to court and give it a shot - this type of approach will not get results and there is no way to prove ATS's statistics.
At least for a camera ticket.
and I have no idea what type of tickets have such a high % of success.
Good luck, and don't waste your money on camera ticket long distance legal advice.
