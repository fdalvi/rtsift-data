Still an original Kmart with the lunch counter & ICEE machine.
Lots of good stuff, a little more limited than walmart butter a much better experience and they have lay away

This place is old school.
It's like walking into a time warp when you enter this store.
They're pretty clean and organized, but this place is seriously in need of some updating.
The two times I've had to wait for my fella to get some paperwork done at the DMV, I wander across the street to kill some time.
The store is small, but they do have a lot of stock and they have a good selection of NFL sport items for pretty reasonable prices.
Good for gifts this time of year, so I've picked up the random odd and end here on the two times I've wandered in.
Service is ok, nothing spectacular.
All in all, pleasant shopping experience.

Got what a needed in and out fast :) everybody was friendly and helpful ,will be back soon:)
