Every mother that I have worked with who has used Tammy either in her capacity as a massage therapist or as a doula, has been incredibly satisfied with her services.
The feedback I get is that she is reliable, professional, personable and exudes confidence in her ability to help them succeed, with either their birth plan or make them feel a whole lot better with her magic skills.
As a lactation consultant, I have seen the results of mothers who have visited with Tammy prenatally so they could feel their best, as well as the tired and sore new mother who is recovering from the hard work of pregnancy and birth.
All mothers feel much better after a massage with Tammy and I highly recommend her services.

I have been to Tammy now for 2 pregnancy massages and they were both wonderful!
She positions you just right and you are super comfortable even on your side.
She even showed me how to arrange my pillows when I sleep for maximum comfort and minimal arm and shoulder discomfort while I am sleeping on my side.
I dont know about her doula services but we are really thinking about using her for the birth of my little one!
I cant wait for my next massage!!!

Tammy is awesome!
My wife is pregnant with twins in a high risk pregnancy and we wanted to get her some professional relief with massage therapy.
Apparently Tammy is one of the only (if not THE only) massage therapists in the Phoenix area with a Prenatal massage certification.
She is thorough and makes sure that your doctor approves of the massages and lets her know of any restrictions.
She was a pleasure to work with and a great masseuse!
