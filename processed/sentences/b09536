What can you say...have you ever had a Walgreens that isn't convenient?
While I'm still not sure why Walgreens stocks Arizona tourist t-shirts and Cactus snow globes, it is still my go-to place for prescriptions, home medical and last minute things.
It even saved my bacon on the holidays when I needed eggs.
This location (as of this review) also has a RedBox unit inside making it perhaps the most convenient convenience store for medical, movies and last-minute items.
Oh and passport photos!
Staff has always been friendly to me as well.

Your 24hours corner store... the closest one to Power Ranch, Cortina, Sossaman Ranch... even Coronado Ranch... always helpful!!!
Oh now, they're selling beers also... (just in case)

It's Walgreens.
This one is nice because it has a 24 hr pharmacy, and a clinic (NOT urgent care, just a clinic) in the back.
Everything else is similar to Walgreens everywhere.
