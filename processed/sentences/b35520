Before trying Froyona I had never had frozen yogurt before and since then I've spent a considerable amount of time mourning those lost years.
This place caught my attention because I was driving by and there was a line!
You've got the standard flavors like vanilla and chocolate and then you've got flavors like root beer float, cake batter, cookies n' cream.
What's really cool is that the flavors don't stay the same, almost every time I go in there are different flavors and they offer samples.
Now, let's get to the toppings!
There are several different sauces to choose from like caramel, hot fudge and butterscotch.
Just a few of the toppings are brownie bites, cream cheese bites, reese's pieces, m & m's, frosted animal cookies, white chocolate, dark chocolate.
There must be at least thirty different topping and they are all delicious!
The shop itself is really nice too with comfortable chairs, natural lighting and the staff are helpful and polite.
The ONLY reason I didn't give this place five stars is the serving sizes.
There is only huge and ginormous.
I'm sure this has to do with the fact that this stuff is sold by weight so they encourage you to indulge.
Usually, I do, and then I kick myself for putting to much in my cup.
I've gotten pretty good at keeping tabs on how much I'm putting in it but those cups fill up fast and if your not careful you will dread that scale.
My total usually tallies around $12 and that's for me and my son (don't just assume it was for me...).
I wish they had a smaller cup for when I want to have just a taste and I won't have to worry about packing on the pounds on either scale....

I am a loyal customer and love the place!
The only reason I didn't give a full 5 stars is that it is pretty pricey but it's clean so I love it!

Way better than Sweetie Peas!!
I love this place!
Great service!
My favorite is the Hawaiian Sherbet!
I can't find it any other place !
