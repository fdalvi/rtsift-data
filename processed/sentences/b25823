Helpful and knowledgeable.
Definitely worth checking out for flooring needs.

Paradise Tile was the first and only place I called when I needed to get new flooring for my home.
We were moving into a new house and needed new carpet.
I called Cosimo and he gave me great personalized attention.
We went to the store to pick out carpet we might want.
He met me at my soon to be home, measured, and brought the carpet samples with him that we had selected.
He gave us a quote right then and there.
I wanted the job to get done immediately upon us receiving the keys to the new house, and he made it happen.
It was a large job, but he has a great installer and we are very happy with the result.
Thanks Cosimo!

I just happened upon Cosimo's store and am so grateful I did.
I was at my wit's end in my then unsuccessful search for the perfect tile for my kitchen backsplash.
Cosimo came through, and his installer did an excellent job.
My experience was so good, I was determined that I would get my hardwood floors from him.
Again, he really cared for me and my project, and I am ecstatic with the result.
The installer was a perfectionist who was also friendly and considerate as well as professional.
I will continue to use Cosimo for all my tile and flooring projects.
Just can't say enough nice about my experience.
