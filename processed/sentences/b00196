A comedic collection of hipsters and hobos, peppered with semi-pro poker players and and a hanoi-jane pissing target in the urinal.
Swing by the Stop-N-Go on the way out and grab a Sparks.
Quite real.

The burgers are amazing and ridiculously reasonable!
The staff is friendly and attentive.
The place is super clean!
They do everything right at Players!
Good drinks, great lunch specials and awesome service!

Great bar for Packer games.
Free shots for touchdowns.
Pot Luck on Packer sunday.
Bring a dish to pass.

The atmosphere was great.
Super sports bar.
Service was excellent!
As long as your not focused on the food.
No credit cards either.

Absolutely one of my favorite bars.
It's definitely got a neighborhood vibe, but it's chock full of some of the friendliest staff you'll ever meet.
And can we talk about the burgers for a minute?
They are wonderful.
One of the best in Madison, in my opinion.
There's a light, airy bun and a perfectly greasy burger with your choice of cheese and grilled or raw onions.
I work nearby and it takes every chubby bone in my body to stop me from going there every day.
Food is ready fast, and you'll always get a smile.
Cash only, but there's an ATM.
(The ATM is also super-speedy, which is odd and exciting.
It's the little things).
