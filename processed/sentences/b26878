Really tasty pretzels.
The fresh lemonade is a little tart, but yummy!

Cin a bitz.
...do yummy!
So is the Pepperoni pretzels!
The line was long, and I just needed something to eat!
I can't remember the service, but what I got was good!

I personally like Auntie Ann's pretzels, but we were starving and needed a snack.
We ordered and both felt that the dough was overly salted.
Even though I asked for a plain pretzel with no salt, there was a large salt presence tasted.
I liked that the cheese sauce that they gave us was warm, and flowing.
