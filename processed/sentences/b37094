Really great experience.
Called before I left MSP.
Got to PHX and car was ready as soon as I got my bags.
Very clean and professional.
Will use again when car service is needed.
Well done.
Thanks.

Always professional and great rates!
If you're out bar hopping or just need a ride somewhere call these guys!
I've used them for years!

AZ VIP and more importantly Dave have always provided the highest level of service in the transportation industry not only in Scottsdale, but anywhere I have traveled.
In the eight + years I have been using them Dave has gone out of his way on multiple occasions to accommodate me and my needs.
AZ VIP is the first call I make when I need a car in the Phoenix area.
