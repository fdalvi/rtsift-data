I would have given them 0 stars if possible I went today and there was 3 people in the place The Bartender/Wattress was on the phone and after 15 minutes never even looked my way so I just left Will not go back as first impressions are most important

Nice bartender!
She kept our drinks flowing even though it was only 8am on a Sunday morning!
The food was disgusting.
Super, super gross.

If you are just going for drinks and gambling, hit this place up.
I frequent this joint on Saturday during the daytime.
Carrie serves drinks, and she does it well.
The kitchen is rather bland  bar food and atmosphere is like any other Vegas hole-in-the-wall bar: video poker, dark, TVs, smoke, some sports carp on the wall, and the local drunk glued to the bar.
But the strong cocktails and attentive service keeps me coming back - and is what my review is based on.

Sara: great service!
Food: so much better than run of the mill bar fare.
Get the veggie quesadilla.
So.
Good.

Great bar, good bar food!
My girl Sara is awesome!
Much love!
Just met Eddie tonight, doing a great job with a busy bar, still provides great service with a great attitude!
Bars like this are hard to find!
A must go for a good time an great princes!
