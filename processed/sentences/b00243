I was pulling a U-Haul trailer from Michigan when my van started to lose power on I-90 in Madison.
I saw that I was leaking transmission fluid and began to look for a nearby transmission service garage.
When I got to Eastside Transmission the first thing I noticed is they keep a very clean shop.
There were only two techs on duty and were busy.
Dan quickly looked at the two vehicles ahead of me then came over to look at my car within minutes.
He took time look it over well and determined that the transmission was getting hot and discharging fluid out the overflow line.
He said I needed to let it cool and take it out of over-drive and I should be fine.
I was on my way in 20 minutes and didn't even charge me for the diagnosis.
We made it home without further problems.
It's nice to find a good honest shop when you're away from home and need immediate service!

My wife's 98 durango took a dump, if you know whats I mean.i'm new to the area and peoples here said this place was fair.they couldn't have been any truer.this is a great place and great service.hopefully don't have to come back soon , but if I did I would come here.

I heard funny noises and my car wasn't shifting right... it made me a bit leery, and I am from out of town.
I called East Side, and they were very up front saying that they would be able to drive it around, check my fluid levels, and let me know what they thought.
Everywhere else I had contacted was booked, and these guys came through!
Very Helpful!
