this pizza tastes just like peter piper pizza.. except the games and such.. awesome crunchy wings prices are great.. they have live shows on special days.. really great staff.. the wibe is great.
great atmosphere

Went here on an early Sunday afternoon.
The place was empty, but we were a large party of 16, and got seated right away.
Sadly, we would ask for items and were told AT LEAST 3 times "Sorry, we're all out of ...".
How are you out of everything when you just opened and your restaurant is empty?
My meal was ok.
The servers did not seem to know who ordered what and were giving people someone else's food.
Someone ordered Honey BBQ wings and said that they tasted like they had been reheated.
If you had a dish that required a fork, well you had to request silverware.
The servers just did not anticipate the guests needs and had to be prodded for everything.
I had to ask for a salad that I had ordered that never came out with my meal.
If I could give -5 stars I would.
Will not be returning.
