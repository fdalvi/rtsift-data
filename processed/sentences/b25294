Kathy usually does her best to take  great care of me and my nails.
The other two techs I have spoken with when being helped by Kathy also seem very nice.
Can get busy.
I have had one or two unfortunate mishaps here from other techs filing too much and making my cuticles hurt.
Overall though I can't complain.
It's usually very quick in here once you are seated.
I've since moved on to greener pastures where my nails don't hurt!

Don't come here!!
Stay away!!!
Not clean , reuse the pedicure water on other people.
Tell you it's an hour wait , when really it's more like two hours!!!
They are rude & prices change all the time!!
They include their tip on the price as well .
They remove to much skin on the callus remover pedi .
Seen this happen on two people while I was waiting .
These people couldn't even walk properly .
STAY AWAY!
