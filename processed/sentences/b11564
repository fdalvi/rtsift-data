I like this 7 Eleven for the following reasons:  - It's close my house.
- There are plenty of gas pumps.
- There is adequate space between pumps.
- The Police Substation is a few hundred yards away, this is probably the safest 7 Eleven in Vegas!
Cops are always getting gas here.
- The store is clean.
Will I return?
Absolutely!

Don't get a car wash from the pump unless u plan on going inside to get a receipt u can actually read(and its all the pumps not just one).
Also be ready for attitude from Lori when she has to stop talking to "regulars" to do her job.

I like this 7-11.
The staff is nice, everything is always stocked, and their nachos rock.

This 7-11 is very conveniently located for me to get gas and coffee in the mornings.
I'm here about once a week.
It's also nice when we run out of whole milk for the baby.
We can even ride our bikes to it.

I come here pretty much everyday but that doesn't mean I like it.
I only buy gas from here if I'm completely on empty, otherwise I go to the Chevron up the road.
But I am a Slurpee addict and I need ice so I continue to come here.
