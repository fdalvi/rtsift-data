Cherry is a nice place.
I hesitated to give it 4 stars due to the out-of-the-way location, but I went with it anyway.
This is probably not a place for tourists as it's way out in the depths of Summerlin (west Las Vegas), but that's why the Red Rock has become a hit with locals.
You don't have to worry about running into yokels from Maine.
I didn't spend any time in the dance area.
From what I remember it wasn't too big.
They play a lot of the typical hip-hop/r&b/dance music you hear everywhere else.
Outside is where Cherry shines.
Beyond the dance area there's plenty of room to stretch out near several pools.
There's also bars set up with misters so you don't have to fight the dance crowds.
The drinks, like anywhere else are pricey but average by Vegas standards.
A Long Island Ice Tea cost me $7.
A subsequent Corona was a little less.
The gut punch of the night came when I had to pay $6 bucks for bottled water.
Yes, it's some weird Italian stuff I've never seen before, but I shouldn't have to pay full drink price just to try to sober up.
Cherry is one of the newest places in town.
The Red Rock casino itself has gotta be less than two years old.
There is a line to get in.
You must dress well.
Clientele is above average in the looks department.
Again, avoid the insanity of the music/dance zone.
Head for the outdoor area.

The only reason Cherry gets four stars and not five is because of its location.
It's not anywhere close to the strip, but for us Las Vegas locals, it's a big winner.
Good music, great dance floor.
A really fun atmosphere due to the large amount of locals.
The BEST part is that it spills out into an extremely sexy private pool and cabbana area -- this is THE place to be during the hot summers.
I hear they also have special topless pool parties every Sunday afternoon...
I highly recommend the Red Rock Hotel in general.

Weird I thought I reviewed Cherry....the deal with Cherry is that it's in Red Rock Casino, which is way out on Charleston and 215.
I don't see it as being a real touristy place.
Very cool for the locals.
Ok so I know my clubs.
When this first opened there were so many problems with it.
I had 15 people come in and we ordered 3 bottles which was cool because they were ok with that.
We sat in the owners box with the Fertitta's.
They were pretty cool.
But my bunch was getting rowdy.
I had more people coming in and I was getting yelled at by the security guys...right...I'm spending 1600 dollars and you're gonna yell at me for being in the entrance trying to get my people in?
Well literally - this place is shaped like a cherry.
Stemmed hallway into a round night club.
One circular bar - dance floor, vip tables, and an outdoor area.
I liked the layout.
It was different.
The guys bathrooms.
FUN.
The urinals are shaped like lips.
The toilet is one way glass.
It's pretty cool.
I've been several times later - sometimes it's hit and miss.
My vip host who promised me a free bottle is gone.
So new management.
Regardless I still got screwed in the end.
I don't really endorse this place because of that instance.
All the other times I've been here I've felt the same way - I go here for my friends.
Not because I want to.
I'd rather be at the Rocks Lounge.
Cherry can get to be a little chic with their long lines.
Their layout outside sucks because the line can block or be a burden in the casino.
But hey it's the Fertitta's they don't care.
The other thing is guest lists.
There's not really one - if you're important you get walked in.
I hate having to call Stations vip to walk me into there.
It's retarded.
Unless you have a table - that's the only other way you bypass the line.
There's a few things in their operations they need to change to make it a little better.
Their music format isn't the greatest.
Also the bar is a little pricey to compete against a strip casino.
Overall.
2.5 stars....Not the biggest place.
Not always convenient - it's hit and miss.
Sometimes there's no line and it's dead.
Sometimes the line stretches through the casino.
Again....Operations people - Make it work!

I went here a couple of times last summer.
The dance area is eh.
Its pretty small, cramped and lame but the highlight is definitely the pool area!
Cool seats, tons of people, nice relaxing area to just chill.
We always just skip the indoor area and go on outside.
Cheap cover and usually no line either.
Awesome.

Mixed crowd, mixed music, I have no complaints, spacious, quick drinks, beautiful venue, some locals, friendly people, some conversation, dancers, and loungers.

First time there and thought it was pretty cool.
Big dance floor.
Two bars, one inside, and the other outside by the pool!
Decor was alright, but nothing notable or flashy to remember besides the entrance tunnel/walkway.
Plenty of seating as well both inside and out.
The crowd was very mixed which is something I look for at every nightclub I go to.
So no complaints there.
Both locals and tourists are there, but it's mostly locals I must say.
It didn't bother me but whatever.
I still had fun.
I was there with a local and some friends of hers from both out of town and in town.
A lot of fun was had, and friends made.
It really wasn't too crowde at all on the other hand.
It was crowded, but not to a point where you can't move.
It flowed well and the overall crowd was cool.
Didn't feel ghetto or anything like that.
The music was very mixed.
I found that awesome.
Played some hip hop, to 80's, to some rock.
I totally dig that.
Clubs out in the Bay Area need to take notes from the clubs in Vegas as what to play.
It's so much better, and not to mention, a lot better looking.
I'd come back here again for sure for that low key, yet fun, club to hit up in Vegas.

It's really funny how I just watched the movie 21 and they show a scene of them coming into Cherry, and it just looks like a huge club.
It totally isn't.
I think that's its appeal, though... it's a club off the strip that isn't ginormous like Rain or Pure is.
Personally, I'm not crazy about the loud, dance-heavy inside.
I go right to the outside, where the cabanas line a small pool, and there's a much easier to tolerate outside bar.
I've only been here a handful of times, and have never paid or stood in line being a local and all.
I'd recommend scouring the Red Rock for promoters handing out free passes as I've been handed a few before.

I think it's pretty cool.
Went on a Friday night and didn't have to wait in line.
The crowd was mixed-like you get some oldies and the newly 21-ers but mostly oldies.
When i say oldies i kinda mean the Cougars and the Male-Cougars (what are those called) Pretty pool and cabanas.
Good size dance floor.
It wasn't packed and we didn't wait in line.
We found VIP passes at the lounge so yay- freebie.
Drinks are cheaper than on the strip and equally good.
I think Red Rock is a good local treasure.
More like a 3.5 but couldn't make it up to the 4.

Despite what the naysayers may say about Cherry, I for one love this joint.
It is slightly far away from the strip, in the semi-secluded area of the Red Rock.
With that in mind, this place attracts mainly young Vegas locals instead of the usual touristy crowd.
The music is rockin, the drinks are strong, and getting in is not a hassle like other strip locales.
Unlike a lot of places that look like crap when the lights turn on, Cherry is a posh lounge during the day when its open.
The dance floor is of a decent size and there is a great view of the pool.
Bartenders are friendly and the lines are never too long on the weekends.
The ambiance / decor is worthy of any 5 star club in Vegas, making this one of the more beautiful venues with an attractive crowd.

Had a blast the three times I've been here this week.
: \ It seems without discounts or freebies, chicks may be free while guys are $20.
The first night we weaseled our way in early (10:30) and there were maybe 5 people inside.
It was picking up by 12:30 when we left.
The bartenders seem to be pretty quick, but again, we were there early.
The crowd was fairly Vegas standard, a bunch of beautiful people and some questionables.
I really love the space, with all its cabanas and the pool and the little private lounges inside (although be careful, there are steps all over in those little areas and this is Vegas so you're most likely drunk and in heels, plus it's a club so it's dark).
As a venue for private events it's fantastic, especially given the wonderfully perfect Vegas weather this time of year.
I really enjoyed myself.
I was a little fascinated by the fact that I can see out to the dance floor while I'm peeing.
I also hear this is the "European" pool by day, so it's definitely where I'd be - I hate tans lines.

Went to Cherry last night for the first time in over a year.
Being a local for more than 3 years, Cherry truly reminds me of the now defunct Whiskey Bar at Green Valley Ranch.
This is definitely a local spot.
The music was rockin, and the drinks were strong.
The dance floor is small, but we usually go outside and chill by the cabanas.
It was a good mixed crowd.
Saw "the Glove" Gary Payton in the mix.
Good place to mingle with the locals.
Go on Fridays.
There's no cover til 11pm and drinks are half off.
And the line is short.

First time to a club in a while.
halloween night was outstanding until my 2 cousins had too much to drink.
other than that this place was packed!
the decor was marvelous.

Cherry reminds me of the clubs they have back in my hometown (SJ!
)...it's chill, crackin and fun fun fun.
The entrance tunnel is impressive.
When you walk through it, you can't help but get pumped for the night to come.
Whenever I'm here, I don't have to worry about some sleazy, sweaty guy trying to rub off on me.
The crowd consists mostly of locals, so it's pretty chill.
Can't say too much about cover or drinks cause I'm a girl.
;)  As for the bathroom, it's VERY dark and VERY cramped.
Other than that, Cherry is guaranteed fun almost every time.

After seeing the movie "21", I had to stop in to check this place out at the Red Rock Casino.
There's a long mirrored tunnel that leads you into the club, and the first thing you see (when it's not packed) is a huge glowing red bar.
great site!
The Men's room is worth checking out, too... the urinals are huge Rolling stones-like lips (see my posted photos).
When I was there, there were Women charging in just to check this out.
The place is small, but worth seeing.

Cherry wasn't bad.
There was NO line.
There was NO cover.
But at the same time, there was NO variety in the patrons who were there.
There was NO real jump off.
There was NO good lookin' dancer up in those bushes and there wasn't anyone enjoying bottle service really.
There was this one group of asian dudes who had bottle service, but I have the feeling that they were more or less posers.
The cabanas are nice and very large but, again, there wasn't anyone enjoying bottle service.
So, it was a lil hard to tell what the enjoyment level would be if we'd had a lil party there ourselves.
The pool is nice and reminded me of the experience I had up on the roof top at Tao.
but it lacked a lil something.
There was this huge discussion about the men's restroom.
I thought that was weird, but after reading Andy B.
's review, I was happy to find that it wasn't just my group that was making a big deal about it.
And yes, Andy, there were people goin' into the restroom to just check it out.
I thought that was hillarious.
I think Cherry is more of a local spot.
But for that reason too, it was a lil more chill.
The space was nice and the seats were ample and available.
The drinks were aiight but not too poorly poured or priced.
I can't really complain.
Parking was easy and getting to Cherry is easy.
A good time.

I really liked this club - it wasn't like the typical Vegas club with a crazy line and pretentious crowd trying to be cool.
The whole "pick me pick me" vibe was absent, thank God.
Of course, it is way off the strip, but the hotel in general truly is a city within itself.
You can hole yourself up here and never leave, but still have a great time.
The music was fab fab fab!!
When we went, it was DJ Digdug and he can really mix.
I don't know if he's the regular dj or not, but hopefully yes because he rocks.
He uses a computer, but vinyl too, which is cool, and becoming increasingly unusual.
The music was all the best dance music you'd want - old and new, and the dance floor was bumping consistently.
I was out there all night.
There is actually a special stage just for the ladies, no guys allowed - interesting, but not always used since you are on display for the world.
You better have some confidence to go up there, or a really slutty outfit.
In addition, there are quite a few go go dancers perched about.
The drinks are typically priced ($10 or so for mixed, $7 for beer.
)   Generous pours.
Running a tab is difficult because they don't seem to remember the patrons, so you have to keep reminding them who you are.
I say bring cash to make it easier on yourself.
The bathrooms are crazy.
I heard about the mouth-urinals in the guys', but the girls' is another story.
There are no lights in the stalls.
None.
Even the main area where the sinks are is extremely dim lit.
You are practically blind in there, so forget about even trying to fix your lipstick.
Not gonna happen.
When I first entered as a newbie, I opened the stall, saw that it was pitch black, and asked some lady (cougar type - there are many there) where the light is.
She said, "Oh honey, there are no lights in here!
You have to feeeeeeeel your way around.
"  Oooookay.
I soon realized why.
The stall doors are two way mirrors.
When I went in and closed the door, it was like the door was transparent and I could see everyone outside.
Cool concept I guess, but a little unnerving and I'd rather be able to see.
There are also those annoying attendants trying to sell their perfume squirts and hairspray usage in each bathroom.
I guess it's good when you want something, but I hate when they hand me a paper towel and expect a tip.
The bathroom issues bumped this place down a star.

cherry is one of my favorite hang outs here in vegas..  and it's probably because it's off the strip and not as 'vegas' and crowded as the popular clubs on the strip.
I hate not being able to walk from point a to point b without touching sweaty nasty club ppl.
gross.
anyway,  I definitely appreciate the music.
they play the goooood hip hop.
not the typical radio 'hip hop...' pharcyde, method man, 2pac, biggie, estelle!!!
they'll start to play a little of the higher energy music later in the night if u appreciate that.. hahaha, I don't.. so thTs usually que to bounce out and call it a night!
we got bottle service the last two times we went and it's a great great service.
it's not ur usual 400+ for a bottle.
they give great deals and serve u as if u ordered the most expensive bottle.
cabanas are clean.. all have tv's.. and they'll hook u up with whatever channel too.. ha!
dancefloors not huge, but the music carries outside where there are plenty of places to just chill and enjoy ur drank to good music...   thumbs up cherry.
do it to it.

Another local favorite according to my friends who live in town.
Unfortunately, it's pretty quiet during the week and I stayed at this hotel Monday through Wednesday.
So, it wasn't the best.
I can get a feel for the good vibes, though, and the Cherry Pool and bar attached to the club were the best spots to be even mid-week.
Great drink specials.
Ask!

If I could give this place ZERO stars, I would!
The club management are complete douchebags who don't seem to know they are working at a club OFF THE STRIP.
I've been here a couple of times (including once for my birthday two years ago) and normally it was fine.
Good music and pretty um, lots of space (read: not crowded).
However, a couple of weeks ago we went with a large group of students, over 60 people, after a student function.
Some people from our end had previously negotiated an "after party" at Cherry with Cherry management where ALL of our students would get free admission into the club.
But when we got to the door, Cherry management didn't want to let us in.
Oh wait, I forgot, they would let us in at $20/guy.
C'mon!
This isn't a club on the strip and not nearly as cool.
They would have gotten lots of $$$ in drinks from us and we would have filled the dance floor.
In my opinion, they were just being douchebags and wanted to see if they could push us to pay more $$$.
I was very, very disappointed.
And I'm never going back there again.

Close to home yay!
I don't know if this makes sense but Cherry is kinda the place to go when you are too lazy to go down to the strip...or you feel like you're at 70 percent instead of 100.
It's a good time with less effort involved.
I would go probably only on a Friday or Saturday night, I think last time I went was a Saturday pretty early but there was still a decent crowd.
I can totally see this place being dead earlier in the week though.
The outdoor pool area is nice regardless of weather.
The place is a little small but the lighting is good.
I'm always curious as to how the dancers on the bar don't knock anything over...  Only thing that sucks is music is ridiculously loud.
But who actually talks in a club anyway?

There should be a disclaimer to the CLOSED title.
CHERRY STILL LIVES!!!....technically.
Cherry is available for private parties and used as a concert venue.
Last time I've been there was for some random girl I met in Red Rock brother's wedding party.
WTF right?
The Red Rock has a special place in my affinities of Las Vegas, mainly because it's super close to home, literally walking distance.
Cherry was the perfect extension of a nightclub to anyone who lives in or near West Vegas, is local, and likes a "lighter" party atmosphere.
By "lighter", I mean that the crowd was always a little more lax about partying.
The Las Vegas strip clubs (mind you, i did separate strip and club) usually end up in being horrendously filled with ed hardy shirts, true religion jeans, and male hair filled with product fighting the nasty effects of gravity....or wearing suit jackets.
Cherry was the perfect mix of locals dressed to the nines while staying casual...make sense?
The entrance way is what kept me coming back: dark, sparkly, and red.
The bar was set up at the center of the club where up to 8 bartenders served drinks quick.
The drink prices here were the cheapest in the city.
Lastly, the poolside always remained open throughout the year with the bungalows used as VIP areas, which always provided a good getaway from the crowded dance floor.
I'll definitely miss this place.
The club scene in Vegas is going through another revamp, hopefully for the better.

I use to come to this club if I didn't want to go to the Strip and deal with the stupid lines.
When I found out that Cherry reopened I was excited!
My friends and I decided to check it out since we haven't been here since it closed and since we were at the Rock's Lounge, it wouldn't hurt checking it out.
We came here on a Saturday around 2 am; there was no line and no charge so score!
Plus it was a group of 4 guys and 2 girls...what we don't have to meet the ratio?
Yay!
It wasn't too crowded since I don't think everyone knows Cherry reopened, so give it a few weeks.
The music they played was hip hop, house, and rock...so glad since I like variety.

So being a Vegas Local I do not frequent the strip nightclub scene often, except when we are entertaining guests from out of town or just in the mood.
When a local has a party sometimes the hassle is to much to bare.
So a friend of mine had her birthday party at Cherry and they did it right!
We had a BLAST!
Keep in mind if you are staying on the strip and not at this casino or live here I do not recommend taking a cab to this casino to party unless you want to do a smaller more local scene, but if you live or are staying here I highly recommend it.
We reserved a table and had ordered a VIP table with bottle service the prices are reasonable compared to strip prices but trust me if you do a club anywhere in vegas be prepared to drop a pretty penny both in VIP and/or just at the bar.
This isn't the local watering hole back home or your local bar down the street, you are paying for so much more then just some drinks.
Don't forget to tip, the tip is not included in any of the prices you are paying for.
The Bar prices were not as stated earlier in posts they are similar in price to strip prices BUT... they were strong!
LOVED that so much.
My boyfriend was not drinking what the bottles on table were so we were getting his at the bar.
The service was fast and the drinks were strong, he was a happy man.
The thing I liked the most about this club was the staff.
Everyone at the door was nice not the same experience I have had at the strip clubs, The bartenders were fast and paid attention when a new person showed up to order a drink.
The waitresses were hot with awesome outfits and very nice on top of that!
The bouncer next to our table kept chatting with us periodically and even busted out a few dance moves through the night.
The female dancers were hot and kept the vibe going but the best part of that was they have male dancers too!
OMG am I in heaven?!
Sadly their faces were covered but they had tight outfits on to show off the muscles, did a lot of cirque moves (quite impressive) and just kinda walked around talking and taking pictures with people.
So all in all as I said earlier we had a ball, I am even thinking of doing a redo for my last bad birthday next year when it comes back around!
I will gladly pay the prices for an all and all great time with pretty great peeps help serve us!

This place has great potential but the execution is all wrong.
There's an outside and an inside, outside has a pool that had these really pretty floating light up orbs in it.
There's a bar outside and a bar inside.
That's good!
:)  They allow men to dress in shambles at this place.
Sneakers and golf shirts, shorts and flip flops.
I'm supposed to swoon at this?
Blah.
Every girls crazy about a sharp dressed man.
IF you are going to allow that then make a night swim party, you got a pool make it like some of the poolside clubs in Miami.
Throw on a coverup and a bikini and swim till late in the night.
I got in free, guy friend even though he was a local, had to pay a whopping $10.
Dancers were tight and some of the cocktail servers were looking good, but the VIP table chicks had on Jorts and like knee high socks and sneakers????
WTF?
I don't even wear that to the beach it was a mess.
Does not represent an upscale club in Vegas and definitely not at night.
We stayed for one drink then left.
Get a theme and stick to it and make the dress code consistent.

Red Rocks has it all.
Locals.
Cherry Lounge.
UfC fights.
Good Drinks.
Nuff Said?
I do not give Fives out much.
Thanks Fertitta Bros.
Outstanding service without the pressure and parking of the Strip.
Unfortunately, I understand "Cherry Lounge" is now closed.
Excellent Buffet, Friday Night Seafood is turbo-boosted Buffet with manifold offering of choice seafood from Crispy Crustaceans to Fresh, Un-Colored Salmon, Radical and Tender Roasted Red Snapper.
A movie theatre.
Bowling Lanes.
Many Restaurants.
Food Court.
Local and Intimate Concert Venues.

Went there for NYE thinking it would be a fun, west-side, off the strip option....wrong!
The DJ was terrible!
I even spoke to him and asked him to play something more danceable, his reply was, "I'm just killing time" what was he waiting for?
He couldn't "mix" music if his life depended on it.
One song would literally cut off and the other begin, without even matching beats!
Eventually security was guarding the DJ because everyone was so unhappy.
At least I know where I "will not" go next year!
Oh and a waitress slipped on a spilt drink and fortunately my husband caught her, or she would have landed on her face, with three big bottles of liquor in her chest!
