This is a great church that has many opportunities to get involved and connected..
I have to disagree with one reviewer and say there's not a lot going on at WOWCC.
There's so MUCH going on!
Check the calendar or stop by a Sunday service and grab a bulletin!
WOWCC is very active with community outreach too.
Spirit filled, powerful sermons every week by an awesome preacher, annointed praise and worship team and leader- you just have to come and check it out!
Sundays at 9 or 11 or check out their website at www.wowcc.org!

I joined this church in June of 2013 and it was the best decision I've ever made.
I love this place and I have been plugged in ever since.
Best worship, best pastor, best ministries, and this church is filled with so many nice people.
My life has changed for the better since being a member here and I recommend everyone to come try out a service.
