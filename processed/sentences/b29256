Don't be fooled, you may think that this is just an Italian restaurant, but it also does a mean fish and chips.
I haven't actually tried any of the Italian options on their menu, so this may be something I have to do seeing as their fish and chips have been so good.
Earlier this year, I went to Anstruther Fish Bar, one of the best fish and chips in the country, and after than I thought that there would be no where that could top it.
To be fair, St Andrews didn't, but it came mightily close considering it doesn't even specialise in haddock and chips.
The chips are lovely and chunky and hardly greasy at all and the haddock was lovely and tender and the batter very crispy.
What's more is that it is pretty cheap for the quality that you get and it only costs £5 and for an extra 90p you get a side of salad and peas.
The decor of the restaurant itself is great and very spacious and it actually looks quite posh, despite the very reasonable prices!

Excellent little fish and chips /Italian place.
Stop in for afternoon tea.
It's a great price and a great meal.
Left me comfortably full and tasted great.
If you go to Portobello be sure to stop here !

With St Andrew's there are two section' one for the takeaway's and the other as a sit in restaurant.
The restaurant area looks more like a country pub look to it with wooden beams on the ceiling and chairs that look as they have come from a Greek restaurant.
It was the specials board that tempted us in £6.90 for a set meal was a steal.
Even though the place may have smelt clean there where dead fly's in the window.
On second visit I was told that fresh fish would take 20 minutes to cook, the guy obviously was not a chef or cook.
The end product was over cooked and in edible fish, from a four star recommendation  now to a two star, very poor service.
