I have had two manicures and a pedicure at Momentum.
Levi is a very good nail technician and the fact that they have only one station for each just means you need to be sure to schedule and not show up with extra people!
They do bring someone in to use the other station when Levi is busy and I have heard good things about her as well.
I especially enjoyed the massage at the end of the pedicure.
It was more like reflexology than a simple massage and made my feet feel sooooo good!
My manicures have lasted as long as any I have had at a salon and look very nice.

I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the mani pedi I got today.
My boyfriend bought me a gift certificate so I finally went and cashed in.
Levi is great!
He paid attention to detail and if he noticed any tiny flaws he would go back and fix them.
The pedicure was fabulous, although I do wish the water had been a bit warmer.
The staff was friendly and made me comfortable.
It can sometimes be awkward to go to a new solan but the people were great.
I will definitely be a regular here.

They will always take time and take care of you.
Beth, Sarah, and Levi are awesome.
They are friendly and caring.
If you want something wild this is not the place for you, but if you want healthy beautiful hair then come here.
You can't beat the prices for the service!
Also Levi gives amazing  pedicure leg massages!
Salon uses Bumble products that remind me of the beach and always leave my hair super soft!
Family owned!
I support local!
