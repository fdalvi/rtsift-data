Great price and great service.
I has a bad experience with another florist in Casa Grande and ended up at Greens & Things.
They charged me $75 less than the other florist  was going to charge and made the exact arrangement I wanted.
I couldn't be happier and I will use this florist whenever I need flowers in Casa Grande.

Still 5 stars and still the best florist in CG.
They make it so easy to order flowers and don't charge a fortune either.

I ordered an arrangement for a celebration of life and they never delivered and didn't call to warn me.
Didn't receive a call until the next day.
Unprofessional and unreliable!

I send flowers every week and I wanted to make sure this flower shop could accommodate.
I called the store to speak with the manager and he was out to lunch.
I was told by the girl working there that he would call me back when he returned.
He never returned my call.
A couple days later I sent an email and no response.
If this is what they call customer service,  they are not worth my money.
