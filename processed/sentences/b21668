yuck.......Is it me or has McDonalds food gotten smaller & grosser?
I saw they had the McRib making a limited time comeback so I was feeling all nostalgic and thought I'd give it a go.
Big mistake..worse than any school lunch pork patty-by the 3rd bite I was already nauseous.
How does McDonalds stay open the food is sooo terrible and its not even cheap anymore.
Do quality food establishment have to have a drive-thru because people have gotten so lazy they will eat any damn thing as long as they don't have to get off their asses to do it.

cara is best!!!!

Waiting 10 minutes, still haven't gotten my order, I thought this was supposed to be fast food?

I needed to male a quick stop for a drink before going to a show late last night.
I stopped here, and it was quick and easy.
i was in an out in no time at all.
Very efficient staff.
It was 11:15 PM, so there weren't many customers.
Still service was great!

I ordered two double cheeseburgers.
When I got home, I found that the burger had no cheese, nor onions, ketchup, or pickles.
Confused, I looked back at the receipt and it said two double cheeseburgers with no specifications and they charged me full price!
Never going here again.

I can't believe no one has mentioned the African decor in this McDonald's.
It's different and wacky and I kind of love it.
Star!
Stopped here because Boy needed to use bathroom right away.
Bathroom clean.

Manager kind of reminds me of my nephew.

Negative star.
Other than that, it's McDonald's, so what do you expect?
I haven't eaten at a McDonald's in a long time, so I was kind of surprised how hard it is to read the menu.
What with all the new menu options and having to show calories and pictures, there is too much info to fit on the board.
I felt like I needed to sit down with a paper menu to take it all in.
