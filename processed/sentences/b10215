thank u guys!!!

2 thumbs up!!!!

Not a fan !!!
Just another company with a fancy slogan and web page !!
If u have little projects it's kind of a waste of their time , is exactaly how they made me feel !
We will see if they pay attention enough to get the job done right .....

Great service!
I used them for a classic car restoration 5 years ago, and all my parts I sent to Powder Coating Plus are still in great shape.
Their attention to detail and service are great.
Adam was very easy to work with.
