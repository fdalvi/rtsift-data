It's a poorly named business, is PC World.
On a recon expedition to investigate options for a tablet for the Silent Reviewer, I wanted to see demos and see them fast.
I visited two storerooms for PC World, amongst some other businesses.
My mind had boggled from too many online reviews and not enough thoughts of my own.
I wanted to see some tablets, live in action.
Unfortunately, PC World couldn't do that for me.
Empty stands, and the majority of those on display, not working.
Those that were, couldn't connect to the internet.
At first, I thought that was reasonable, until I went to Carphone Warehouse - which held informational displays, and all of the tablets I looked at not only worked, but I could have a right old play on it.
Having grown more and more frustrated running from store to store without really being able to make much of a decision on what to buy, I didn't find my salvation in a store that by its name, I expected to provide.
PC World stores look dated, and the company isn't keeping up with its competitors (likewise for it's identical twin, Curry's - I mean, honestly, why run two separate businesses, especially with they are in the same retail park, with the same stock and same strategy?
) - better offers at Comet, better displays at Carphone Warehouse - and that's just in a shopping centre.
Go online, and PC Worlds offerings grow more and more meagre.
It would be useful if stores such as PCW could offer more, but it doesn't - perhaps it should be named PC Village... that would be more accurate.
