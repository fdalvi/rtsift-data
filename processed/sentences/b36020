Strangest jersey mikes i have been to.
All the employees shout at the top of their lungs- I almost went deaf from hearing DO YOU WANT MIKE'S WAY?!!!!!
Over and over.
The food tastes just like every other jersey mikes so I don't know what they are screaming about.

fresh good food!
best sub I've had in a long time

Great fast service, and the employees were friendly.
I ordered a Philly cheesesteak with jalapenos and it was made within a few minutes and was streaming hot and delicious.
I can't wait to come back and try another sandwich

Their sandwiches are so good!
Love the new sandwich place down the street from the house ;)
