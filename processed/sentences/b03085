Able to schedule an apt, pretty quickly--less than 3 days away to have some moles checked out.
Will let you know, how the visit goes- demeanor, promptness, cleanliness, etc.
But, so far so good.
9-22-09--went to the office, everything was spot on- demeanor, promptness, cleanliness, etc...
He said that my moles were fine, but keep an eye for them; and that dermatologist are looking for the "level of sun exposure" that an individual can absorb (for example a fair blue eyed blonde cannot absorb as much as someone with my background- Filipino).
Suggested, I use Blue Lizard sunscreen and creates his own comic books.
Totally recommend him.
Will use him again, no problem.

Demeanor, promptness fine.
Has treated quite a few skin problems with excellent success.
Highly recommend.

I went in to Dr Lines for a skin cancer screening on June 6th and he found two pre-cancer spots and froze them off, one on my arm and one under my left eye.
The spot on my left eye cause swelling so I stayed home from work the following day.
Because I drive a commercial truck, I needed a doctors note to return to work after the swelling went down.
When I called Dr Lines on the phone afterwards for a return to work note, he stated that if he had to write doctor notes for all his patients that that's all he'd been doing.
He was rude and uncooperative for a simple doctor note for my work.
I'll be looking for a different dermatologist.
