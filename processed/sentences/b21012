Some barbers can seem like they are trying to get through as many haircuts as possible in the shortest time.
Not so at Esq Barbers in Viewforth Gardens.
They always provide a warm welcome, and take both appointments as well as walk-ins.
I have used them for the last 2 years, and have never left dissatisfied with my haircut.
The price for a basic student cut is Â£7.50, and so there's no close shave in the wallet department.
The interior is small but stylish, and with the norm being two staff on at a time, there is hardly ever a wait.
Definitely worth a visit if you want a swift and professional haircut.

Excellent haircut at a very reasonable price, good location, what more do you need?
:-)  I went on a Tuesday lunchtime, didn't need to wait, apparently February is a slow month.
The lovely lady cut my hair exactly as I had pictured in my head.
Will be back again to get it tidied up in a few weeks.
Highly recommended.
