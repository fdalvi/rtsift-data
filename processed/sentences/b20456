I used to and, to an extent, still do hate places like this but I'm open-minded about this one.
It's a 'gifts and greetings' shop - the bane of visits to remote villages with the family as a child.
I was here last week with my mum as she wanted to have a look inside for - specifically - some terracotta coloured candles.
The ladies inside seemed pleasant and directed took her in the right direction, and she left content with two terracotta candles costing Â£6.
It also sells gifts and little ornaments and things to fill the mantlepiece with.
As you can probably tell, I'm no expert in this field but it all seemed pretty reasonably priced.
I'll definitely bear this place in mind for future Mother's Days and impending birthdays.

Oh look, another shop that sells things and stuff.
What stuff?
Oh you know, stuff that you want and need.
Like key holders and candelabras.
That sort of stuff.
I'm probably being a bit acerbic and unfair.
I just don't really have time for shops that sell 'stuff'.
The other thing about this places is the smell.
They have a massive collection of candles (duh!
), scented and unscented.
The thing is, a single scented candle on its own can be quite pleasant.
Even a few can be OK.
But a whole shop full of clashing scents is positively nauseating.
To me anyway.
You might like that.
I'm not saying this is a bad shop, that wouldn't be fair at all.
It's got myriad candles and an impressive greetings card assortment.
And loads and loads of stuff.
Gifts, some people call them.
It's just not for me.
I'm told it's because I'm a man and I just don't get it.
I don't think I want to either.
