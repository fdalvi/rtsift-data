I was working with a gentleman named Robin looking to sell some tickets to an upcoming show.
Robin made me an offer that I thought was fair and I accepted the offer.
When I called back to let him know I was on my way he informed me that they were no longer going to be able to take the tickets.
I have spent money with this company before and thought they were a reputable place with ethics to buy tickets.
I guess I was wrong.
i will no longer do business with Robin or anyone else at Ticket Lobster and I highly reccomend looking elsewhere to spend your hard earned money.

I have bought and sold tickets with this company for many years and highly recommend them to anyone!
Robin is always helpful on time and a pleasure to do business with.
If he says he is going to do something he does it!!
Highly recommended!

Purchased tickets for Cardinals Got the best service and price available highly recommended!
