A true gem of an upscale consignment store.
I will never go retail again.
Great handbag collection.
Dresses are so cute too.
The shop owner, Nicole, has a great eye and you feel like everything in here is brand new.
So easy to consign items also.
I will be back!

I was hesitant to write a review for this shop because I want it to remain my little secret!
That said, I was pretty impressed with the offerings and, like the other reviewer, agree with the wonderful handbag collection.
Many high-end brands are represented, most in top-notch condition (I only noticed a few black bags with minor scuffs and wear-and-tear.
)  The designer jean selection is notable (Seven, True Religion, etc.
) and there were a large number of gently-worn formal dresses.
The owner regularly takes new items for consignment, which makes every visit here different and fresh.
I've found my new go-to place for apparel and accessories.
Chique is small, select, and sophisticated.
I only wish the shop consigned shoes!

This is a great upscale consingment shop with reasonable prices, beautiful clothing and accessories!
The shop is clean, clothes are beautifully displayed, easy to navigate and full of treasures.
The owner is friendly and welcoming.
I highly recommend this shop!
Love it

Bad selection & owner wouldn't even look at items I brought in to sell because she "wasn't accepting anymore at  this time.
"  She also ordered lunch on the phone in front of me when I entered the store.
Not the way to run a high-end boutique!
