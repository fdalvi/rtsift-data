In a town where people proclaim themselves as trustworthy, honest & "The Best", it is incredible to find an air conditioning company that does not simply make statements but earns a reputation by doing a great job at a fair price.
My air conditioner stopped working.
I called George at Highland Cooling & he arrived quickly to help us get relief from the 110 degree weather that was invading our home.
He & his assistant worked for many hours rebuilding my existing AC unit.
My air conditioner is 34 years old.
Any other company would have simply tried to sell me a new unit.
Knowing I was on a tight budget, George rebuilt that which had to be a challenging job.
I have refered Highland Cooling to many people & everyone has been very happy with his service.
If you are in need of an excellent Air Conditioning Company, I highly recommend George at Highland Cooling.

George came to my aid today.
Working with-in the guidelines of a home warrenty isn't always easy.
George was very knowledgable about my unit and didn't try to gouge me on services.
I had another company come out first ( what a mistake) who quoted me a price 3300.00 more than what George was able to fix my unit for.
George and Highland Cooling have got a customer for life.
They arrived promptly and didn't keep me waiting.
I feel I got an honest opinion and price with my unit.
And when it is time to replace my unit, Highland Cooling will be doing the service.
His price quote for a new unit was far below what the competitor quoted me.
Thanks George

We called George and his Highland Cooling team when the cooling went our on the 1st floor or our home.
He discussed the options with us and we agreed on a whole house replacement at a great price.
We were very happy with his estimate, the work he did and now our electric bills are lower.
He even assisted our neighbor when his wife became ill.
I can't say enough good things about the experience with Highland Cooling.
