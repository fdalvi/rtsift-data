This place is great for Mercruiser parts and service.
I started using them after a tip from a family member whose used them for 30+ years.
The people know the parts and always point me in the right direction.
I have saved $100's thanks to their knowledge.
Highly recommend!

Brent at Performance Marine is absolutely the best!
He did a complete rebuild on our 225 Merc ProMax and has it running like new again.
You can place your trust in the work that they do at this shop.
They are stand-up guys whom I place my full trust in.
I cannot say enough great things about this shop - highly recommended!

Love, Love, Love these people!
You know how you feel when you go to the car mechanic and HE knows what he's talking about but you have no clue?
Well these folks are NOT like that!
Very refreshing!
My husband and I are novice boat owners (first boat) and we have a small, used 17ft that we bought from Craigs List.
If anyone knows what BOAT stands for, well we are the poster children for that...break out another thousand!
Long story...trying to make it shorter...our boat took a dump in the middle of Lake Pleasant and after getting it water-towed and back home and it started right away,  we had a mystery on our hands.
My husband was determined to fix it himself and understand the boat, and everyone at Performance Marine supported that cause.
From Sue at the desk to Brent the mechanic (more like genius)...my husband was back and forth with them for a month.
He called them, he stopped by...and they were always willing to help and go the extra mile to help us fix it.
Every time my husband found a problem, another problem was uncovered...it sucked but having Performance Marine on our side was an absolute miracle!
Finally our little beater is running!
Thanks to everyone at Performance Marine!
