PLEASE do not purchase tickets from this broker.
Their mark-up is ridiculously high.
"Limited View" seats which usually go for $119 will cost you about $250 each.
You can find cheaper tickets elsewhere or even directly through the show venue itself.
Please go ANYWHERE else to buy your tickets!

Vegas Tickets offers a great service for those looking for tickets to concerts and shows in last Vegas.
Some might confuse them with the box office of a particular venue or Ticketmaster, which THEY ARE NOT.
They provide a SERVICE.
Some might get mad at the fact a ticket might be sold here for above the face value.
This is the age old concept of SUPPLY AND DEMAND (Duh).
It is lame to blame Vegas Tickets for the price of a ticket that is in high demand.
If you want to hot ticket, guess what?
You will have to pay a premium for it.
Vegas Tickets often offers deals for shows the day of the event.
It is always good to check with them.
On the plus, the staff is friendly, knowledgeable and they offer discounts often.
Check out Vegas Tickets if you are looking for something to do while in Vegas.
They come highly recommended

tried to scam me !!!!
i'm going to las vegas next month so i went online to purchase tickets ahead of time for celine dion concert.
after researching a few sites i decieded to try vegas tickets because of there very low price....  i paid with my credit card and bought what i thought was e-tickets for the show.
the next day i checked my account and saw where the tickets had been paid for.
i soon  recieved an email from vegas tickets saying they were having trouble verifying my credit card and they wanted me to fax them a copy of my drivers license and a copy of my credit card #%&*!!!!$#....
i was disturbed by this so i called and spoke to brian green.
mr. green told me yes i needed to send my drivers license and my credit card.
i told him my account had paid for the tickets and i did not understand why i needed to fax him a copy of my id and my credit card.
my identity had been stolen in the past and i'm very carefull who i give my personal info too.
mr green said "oh come on everyone does this"  i did not like the tone he took with me and decieded just to ask to cancell the transaction and go with another company.
all of a sudden mr green got very arrogant with me and said no problem but the tickets are non-refundable and i still would not recieve them.
i said wait your going to keep my money and not give me the tickets?
he said yes.. you got it !!!
i called my credit card company and got them to reverse the transaction.
it took about 45min on the phone but saved me 185.00 dollars....... just want everyone to know what happened to me.
i wish i would have read the reviews about this company sooner.....

Delivered on time, but seat view completely obstructed.
Wildly overpriced.
Avoid at all costs.

This is a such Company.
I should read this before I buy IT.
** First----------- EXPENSIVE  ** Second------- NOT RESPOND ** Third --------- NEVER DELIVERY ***   BAD SERVICES *****     I bought a ticket for Cirque Du Soleil -O    They sale for me $180.00                             + $28 service                              + $15 for delivery .
-------------------------           I end up paid $223.00  But they Never Delivery and I paid for Taxi to pick up ticket  .
If you buy ticket at Bellagio for this show you PAY $119.00 and if you lost ticket they still print another for you to get in.
The Manage at the theater tell me to call my agent because they couldn't found my name .
I call my agent but they couldn't help me to get in .
I need to buy another ticket to get in .
That is such .
I paid $223.00 and I can not get in to the show.
If you lost a ticket .
They are not respond and refund .
What kind the service they have .
Why they charge for service when they don't have it .
DO NOT BUY TICKET  HERE  !!!!!
