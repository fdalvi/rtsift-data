Arizona Golf Works is a great locally owned golf store that can assist you with everything you need.
It's run by a bunch of old golfers who know their stuff.
They do repairs, re-grips, buy/sell used clubs, as well as sell new clubs.
Their service is great and they don't make you feel dumb if you're a beginner or not great at golf.
They are there to help you and hopefully get you to enjoy the game they love so much.

Arizona Golf Works is the best consignment shop in the city and I stop by every chance I get just to see what may have walked in the door!
I am a "golf junkie" and am constantly trying different clubs.
By buying someones used club and then consigning your own, you can often end up with what you want without a big investment.
They also have a great repair shop and Kim has been repairing golf clubs since golfers were using "mashie niblicks"!
The shop does carry a few lines of new clubs, but their big inventory is used clubs and they literally have thousands of them!
A lot of their used clubs are current models that were used a could of times and just didn't work out for the consignee; there are some great buys!!
Stop by and ask for Bryce or Todd or Chris, they are very helpful and know their stuff.
P.S.
My putter let me down the last couple of rounds  and you will find it for sale at Arizona Golf Works (www.arizonagolfworks.com).
