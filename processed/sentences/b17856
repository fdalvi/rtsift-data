Not kid friendly.
No h/c.
They are the only ones in the neighborhood that still have seafood and crab salad but I happened to get the bottom of the pale so it was kind of gross.

I'd say as Subway's go, this one is average.
How good or bad your sub is really depends on the luck-of-the-draw on your "sandwich artist.
"  There are times you get a 4 1/2" sub which is mainly lettuce, and other times its 6 1/2" with an actual filling.
I will say that I've also been there on several occasions where there ingredients looked less than "fresh.
"  Like wilted lettuce and black guacamole.
But then again, what do expect for $3?
If you want Ruths Chris, its not far away.
