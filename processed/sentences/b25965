The experience at Estrella falls dentistry is unlike any other office in the valley!
They have such a beautiful office with top of the line equipment!
The staff and the doctor are always so upbeat and friendly!
You forget your in a dental office!
Dr. Jay and his assistant Monica make a great team!
I would recommend this office to anyone who is looking for a dental experience unlike any other!

Dr. Jay is THE best dentist I have ever been to!
I was a patient of his for many years and have since moved to CA.
Now I can't seem to find a dentist here even 1% as great as Dr. Jay!
He always made me feel comfortable (I'm a typical scared-of-the-dentist kind of patient) and always made me laugh.
I recommend him and his new state of the art office, you will not be disappointed!
