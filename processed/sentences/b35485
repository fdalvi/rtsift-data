The woman that runs this place is super helpful and knowledgeable.
She fixed problems with a title that even the employees at the DMV in Scottsdale couldn't figure out.
It's a small shop so sometimes there's a wait, but it's way faster than the DMV with better hours.

Evidently you need a smog check that is less than 4 months old.
The lady at the counter gave me a place to run to (like 5 miles away), and I was back at AZ Quick Title & Registration within 30 min receiving my license plates!
Simple!
Much easier than the DMV...

This place makes is so easy for a vehicle renewal.
And it was only a $16 convenience charge added to the total.
I was seriously in and out in less then 5 minutes.
Highly recommend this vs going to the DMV and waiting in line.
