I've been going to Traci for around 7 years now, and for good reason... she has an incredible intuition for how to find and treat the source of deep muscular pain.
As an avid mountain biker I've regularly had pain and and injuries over the years and Traci is always the 2nd person I see, after the doctor.
Not only is she a magician at helping the pain go away, but she is also an amazing person.

Traci is the BEST and I have been to many, she is a true professional at her craft and has the knowledge to back up her great skill.
I have going to her for 5 years and  would highly recommend her facility for true professional care.....Thanks Traci

I have been getting massages from Traci for many years and I follow her where ever she goes.
I even moved out of state but came back just for her wonderful massages.
She gets to the area of pain and works it out.
You WILL fell like a new person after a massage with her.
You must go to Rx Massage if you are in pain and want relief.
Thank you Traci!

Traci is the best!
I highly recommend her - for a relaxing massage or a sports massage or any stressed muscles that needed attention.
I am a professional athlete and I have followed Traci for years and I will continue to see her for my massages.
I have recommended her to friends that have also benefited from her awesome massages.

I cannot say enough good things about Patrick.
He is so skilled and is always able to identify my "problem areas" and work on them to help me feel restored and amazing afterwards.
I refer everyone to Patrick that needs a great massage with REAL results.
Thanks so much for being great and keeping me healthy & vibrant!
