I really like this place.
Both indoor and outdoor seating, the food is pretty good.
You can get items pretty topical to New Orleans/Cajun style, and haven't had a thing there I haven't enjoyed.
The prices are not expensive.
Nice place for a casual time.
The one problem is that sometimes the service can be slow...

I used to love this place and was sad it closed.
I spent many hours at the bar, watching tv, chatting with the crew, and munching some wonderful cajun eats.
It was a gas around the turn of the millenium and, as I said earlier, I was sad to hear of it's decline followed by it's ultimate failure.
