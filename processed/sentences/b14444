Update: They do  not have the USPS Flat Rate Box Service which sucked.
Ended up having to pay twice what I would have paid with the Flat Rate.
Oh well.
At least I did not have to wait in a long line at the post office with a squirmy baby.
:-)   Very friendly and courteous service.
They have Fed Ex, UPS and also United States Postal Service there.
They gave me several different shipping options.
Much better service than at the post office.
I will go here again!!

I went in to fax a document, when I received the bill I was less then pleased and I mentioned how expensive it was.
I was kicked out, flipped off, cussed at and told "We don't need customers like you" Guess I should have been good and not questioned him lol

We like the new location which is facing 40th street and Safeway.
They keep it clean.
People are attentive and I like the fact that I don't have to wait in line forever like at the post office.
They also save your old addresses that you have shipped to before so you don't have to give that info all over again if you send to the same place a lot.
