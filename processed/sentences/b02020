When I get a document notarized at the credit union for free, then take it to my office, stupidly fax it to the wrong number by not adding a "9" at the start only to get a call an hour later from the bank employee who notarized it telling me that the person who received it in error had called her to let her know some numbskull was faxing important-looking legal documents to him by mistake, and does it all with a maximum of cheerfulness and forbearance.
that's service.

Love Desert Schools!
I am not a big-bank fan.
The reason I love Desert Schools is that they are incredibly courteous, friendly, and helpful.
They are great about answering questions and sent I really care about the customer experience.
If you want a good bank where you will actually enjoy the experience, this is where you want to be!

These people make me sick.
They hold my direct deposit payroll checks for up to 14 days!!!!
I set up my bills to auto-deduct when my check will be deposited.
Said I wanted NO overdraft protection.
They hold my check, bills get paid and bam I'm hit with $300 in overdraft fees?
Are you serious?
My money disappears, has not shown in my account for days, shows (-) balance when I know I have money, go down to talk to them and they said, looks good on our side you must have read it wrong.
I know how to read a statement you ignoramous.
Way to make your customers uncomfortable, awkward and angry.
Everyone in there is rude, looks down on you and so incredibly unhelpful.
I heard great things about them, and never in my life have I had a worse experience.
I have banked with Chase, Wells Fargo, TruWest, BOA and desert schools.
Never again would I put anyone in their hands.
Unless you don't want access to your money, people to look at you like you are garbage, not respond to phone calls or e-mails, and hold your check so they can charge you insane amount in overdraft fees because they won't release your own money to you.
