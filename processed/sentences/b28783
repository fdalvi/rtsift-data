Can't beat this place.
It's local, it's open 24/7, reasonably priced, no contracts, the owners are really great.
It feels like it's your own personal gym not some corporate monster.
Everything you really need without the normal franchise fluff  Robert Pfeifer

No childcare and the the girl who works membership is really rude!
Ended up at Lifetime Fitness and so glad I didn't sign here.

Close to home and open 24 hours is more than I need in a gym but also has brownie points like ESPN on the treadmills.
Staff is very friendly and personable.
No, there is no childcare.....why there would be childcare at a 24 hour facility is beyond me.
If you wanna pay more than $50 a month at a gym like Lifetime that is certainly in your power but if you want a cozy gym in your backyard that is cheap you can't beat it!
