I don't wanna go 5-stars wild on this place, but I had an Orange Julius here for the first time in about 15 years and - goddamn - just as tasty as they always were!
I didn't even know the chain existed anymore, so this find stoked me out.

They don't have chocolate ice cream here which is a major fail.
And no dipping in chocolate is not the same thing.
Other than that it was your typical dq.
Good location to take a load off and look out the window at goings on.

Ordered a medium cookie dough blizzard, but the cup was only 3/4 full.
They also added chocolate fudge which I did not order and did not want.
They also skimped on the cookie dough.
Avoid the DQ in Excalibur.
Go to the one in the food court up the street.

Not impressed with this location.
We ordered 2 hot dogs, a sundae and a blizzard.
We wanted the blizzard made with chocolate ice cream and were told they don't have it.
So we said okay, vanilla is fine.
Then the cashier goes to make the hot dogs, and the other person working tells her not to make them because the kitchen was closed (we saw her even take out the hot dogs and then put them back).
After we got the desserts and ordered a sandwich from subway, we discovered the turtle sundae didn't have caramel, and the oreo blizzard had almost nothing but vanilla ice cream.
Very disappointing service.
It's better to go to the other restaurants in the food court.

Tried this place again out of convenience.
They have totally redeemed themselves.
I got the banana pie blizzard.
it was excellent.
