I called ACA today to come and look at a washing machine in a rental property.
He came when he said he would.
It took him about 2 minutes to diagnose the issue and about 30 to fix the broken piece.
He has also fixed a fridge for me in the past with similar results.
He is very dependable, knowledgable and affordable.
I highly recommend ACA.

Our freezer decided to go out 3 days before Thanksgiving!
We needed to have it fixed tonight because our kitchen was being cleaned the next day.
I called them at 6p on a Sunday night and someone actually picked up the phone, talked to me, and then someone was at my door an hour later!
Rick came in, took one look, and replaced the part.
It was AMAZING!
Then he handed me the bill and it was even better!!
Go with these guys when you need an appliance fixed anytime!

My ice maker broke and I called ACA services spoke with the owner Rick and the next day he was at my house replacing my ice maker, very honest, good work and fast.
I would highly recommend this company for refrigerator repairs.
very pleased.

Rick did some work on my dryer.
He did a nice job and was very prompt.
Would recommend.

Rick was great, very knowledgable & very reasonably priced.
He fixed my clothes washer, works great now!

I called ACA at 8:00 pm at night and he still answered and we immediately set up an appointment.
He showed up on time and quickly diagnosed the problem with my washer.
He fixed it in 20 minutes and was out the door.
He was awesome and saved me a bunch of money.
Highly recommend.

I have been doing business with ACA for three years and have always  had great service from them.
They have always been timely,courteous, professional and reasonable.
I highly recommend them!
