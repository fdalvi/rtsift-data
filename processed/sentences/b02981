This Yankee Candle is awesome!
They are very helpful if you can't find what you need.
The manager is super friendly!
I forgot my coupon at home, they were having a sale.
Luckily enough she had tons of the coupons at the register!
I would highly recommend this Yankee Candle!

BEST YANKEE CANDLE EVER !
Ask for Laura !!
She's super sweet and is so helpful !
Holiday shopping can be rough, but with Laura's help it was a breeze and I got 4 great holiday gifts !
She is so awesome and I have already told people about my amazing experience with her !
She's passionate about helping you get what you need to make your loved ones happy !

This location is the worst.
I'm always greeted with attitude from the skinnier lady in the glasses, but continue to come here on occasion since the other locations are a far drive.
They wasted time doing a return for me and specifically said that, every though I was clearly in a hurry, they weren't going to make a jar for jar exchange because they were training a newbie.
Which in fine in most cases, but seeing how I was late to work and they jeopardized my job over something menial am pointless, I'm pissed.
Will be going to san tan or just switching to Bath and Body works for my candles.

I love this store, the holiday candles are the best.
The staff is always friendly and never mind while I sniff all the candles they own.
My 3 candle recommendations for you:  October thru Thanksgiving - Spiced Pumpkin Thanksgiving thru Christmas - Sparkling Cinnamon Anytime else - Lavender Vanilla (ladies love it)  Tip:  Ask the employees to teach you wick trimming.
