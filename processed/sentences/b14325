Went here for a massage from Audrey and she has magic and healing hands.
I thought I was going for just a relaxing massage, but then she asked if I had any areas that are bothering me and ended up with a therapeutic healing.
The office has a friendly staff.
The office is clean.

Great place, caring doc, helped my neck pain significantly using activator technique and gentle adjusting.
The staff are wonderful too!
My neck improved so much that I don't need to go that often anymore, and I'm so happy I found Dr. Greg!

A year ago I was having horrible back pain!
Dr Greg quickly put me on a plan to get me feeling better!
Simply amazing.
Dr Greg is awesome and cares about his patients!
I also have had massages from Audrey...oh so great!!
