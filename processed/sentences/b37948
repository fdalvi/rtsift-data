Finding a quality stylist is difficult.
Finding a hair and makeup artist that takes the time to make you look your best is even harder... Until you visit Elizabeth Ramirez.
She is a true artist who enjoys what she does and takes the time to make listen attentively to what you want... And if it is to look your best, come see Eli.
I have long, black curly hair and I wanted to straighten it out but do so with a twist (specially because my guy hates my straight hair), so after talking a bit about different ideas she started her magic.
She did light and thin highlights and then straightened my hair with an ever-so-slight curl at the tips making it look stylish, fun and just different.
Not to brag, but I everyone who saw my hair absolutely LOVED IT... As did I!!!!!
I will visit again soon.
