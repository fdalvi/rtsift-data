Got here at 645a, in and out !
Helps to come in early !

If you come here for a pre-employment hair drug test, DO NOT trust Michelle Garcia cutting your hair.
I went in for the drug test & was unfortunate to get this MONSTER.
I have long black hair.
This beast cut off a huge chunk of hair from the top/crown part of my head, that started from the right to the left then went down to the back of my head.
It wasn't even a clean cut.
She swore she was making sure you wouldn't be able to see, but she's obviously a liar.
Before cutting my hair she kept telling me how beautiful my hair was.
I was so upset & I made sure she knew it.
She then said, "I'm sorry honey.
" Bitch are you serious??
I quickly shut her up.
Don't tell me you're sorry when you intended to do this.
She didn't even bother cutting my hair from 3 different spots, instead she cut a ridiculously chunk of hair from 1 spot!
If you're reading this Michelle, you're a nasty individual.
You're lucky my hair grows fast

I don't understand Quest's complete disregard for customer experience.
You're a diagnostic center.
People come in for drug testing to blood draws to a lot of other scary medical things.
Don't expect your patients to be experts.
If a lab order isn't clear, why not pick up the phone and call for clarification?
It seems they have a monopoly  on diagnostic testing in the Vegas Valley so avoiding them is next to impossible.
The bathroom was disgusting.
People collect samples in there.
Keep it tidy.
The thing that really grinds my gears is the totally lack of compassion.
Having worked in the medical field and having my own experience with medical issues, a little compassion goes a long, long way.

They were open until 6PM on a Friday, which was convenient for me.
I was in and out fairly quickly for a blood draw.
The staff was friendly.
My only complaint is that the tape they used on my arm did not stick very well, I had to go back and have my arm re-taped before leaving.
