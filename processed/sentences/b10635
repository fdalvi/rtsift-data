OK so you don't acknowledge that I'm even in your store.
You look annoyed in fact.
I don't like your vibe.
You act like you have somethng better or more important to do.
Maybe you're having a bad day?
That's not an excuse.
Can I see this item?
no response   OK well guess what, I'm out of here.
You don't care a shit that I'm in here.
You dont want to help me.
You won't even pretend to care.
I'm done!

I frequent this store often when shopping for really special gifts for family and friends.
This location is always immaculate and organized, and the selection is amazing considering that it is such a compact space.
I was in earlier this week and I have to say that the sales staff are always super friendly and helpful and make it a pleasure to shop at this location.
Well done and thank you!

I purchased a ring here about a year ago (customer service was amazing) but a crystal fell out of it about a week ago.
Perfect timing because we had a trip planned to Vegas so I brought it with us hoping they could fix it or replace it.
I brought it in and the girl said no problem and replaced it!
This is what customer service should be like!
No questions asked and replaced it with a smile.
Thank you!
