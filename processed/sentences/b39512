Susan Powell, CMT with Dynamic Wellness Now is amazing.
She's a Reiki Master, Massage Therapist, and Myofascial Release Therapist.
Best part is, she travels to YOU!
Without a doubt, the best massage I've ever received and I'm certain it will never get better.
It's hard to explain in writing, but she's so in-tune with the body.
She knew exactly how hard or soft to push, she released tension, and she honestly made me feel the best I've ever felt.
She's mobile, so give her a call and get a massage in the comfort of your own home!

Susan Powell CMT of Dynamic Wellness is beyond amazing.
I injured my back a year and a half ago and medical doctors have been unable to help me without pushing meds.
Susan was able to pinpoint the problem in just a few minutes and had me back on my feet again.
She comes to my home on a regular basis and I considered  her as part of my personal wellness program.
For personal comfort and wellness, definitely give Susan a call.
And the BEST part ... she comes right to YOU !

Susan has the healing touch.
I was in a lot of pain and with one service she was able to get me moving again.
Her technique and process is beyond compare.
I like that fact she will come to you and leave you in a peaceful place.
