Here on a recommendation I was already looking forward to my rare style hit for the day before mounting the stone steps and entering the chilled space.
The name 'Barber' not to be confused with male only clientele, I am a woman, seeking a woman's cut, and that is what I got.
Being a late appointment on a Monday evening I was the only one getting the chop treatment and wow it felt good.
After a visionary chat I knew the hairdresser was able to style as required and it was time to relax and watch Stockbridge pass by.
Excellent value for a wash, cut and style: Â£27.50.
I left thankful, beaming and bouncing along the cobbles!

After looking for a new hairdressers for ages after moving over from Glasgow, I looked on yelp and thanks to the previous review, I decided to book an appointment for a very long awaited haircut, at what seemed to be more a gents hairdressers than a ladies.
Not only was I made to feel extremely welcome, it has to be the best cut and blow I have had in years.
I felt a million dollars leaving the shop, 6 inches lighter and also very pleasantly surprised by the price.
Boombarbers is now my new hairdressers in Edinburgh.
Big thumbs up and a huge thank you!
