This one's ok but you really need to be aware of your surroundings because there are so many strange people here- druggies, tired as hell looking people.
The selection of food is good.
Not well-maintained.
A security guard is at the door.
The parking lot is a mess- the lot is adjacent to Burger King.

You can never go wrong with 99 Cents.
Fill your cart and you pay only 20 dollars.
Basically you can find anything from food, to cleaning supplies to electrical stuff.
You can get name brand products too once in a while.
I personally don't love this particular store (Charleston-Maryland).
First of all, the store can get a little disorganized and dirty.
Second, the employees speak little or no English at all.
And lastly, they do get a lot of homeless, strange, and drugged people that makes me a little scared to shop there.

Has the best holiday decorations for only 99 cents!
Also has great pet supplies!
Can't beat it!

If you need veggies like lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers or carrots, this place can't be beat.
If you need pop chips, this place can't be beat, if you need batteries, cleaning supplies or first aid supplies this place can't be beat.
But, if you need to go to a store without fear of being stabbed or being harassed for money in the parking lot, stay away.
