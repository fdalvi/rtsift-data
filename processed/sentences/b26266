Shortage of Employees.
Or maybe they have enough employees to handle a normal workload but way to many customers buying and pawning.
But when you do find a sales associate they are more then helpful.
AND FYI you can haggle with them over the prices.
Why buy NEW when you can buy SUPER PAWN with the 30 day Money back guarantee which i have never returned anything.

This location is OK...the employees at this location are scare and dont seem to overly helpful, which again surprises me.
Not my favorite superpawn.

It's just a stupid place to be at.
Manage your money correctly.
