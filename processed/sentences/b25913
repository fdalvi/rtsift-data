Tony and his team did a great job!
I was a first time customer, and asked for an oil change.
Not only did he change the oil and check all fluids, he also checked my A/C, found out it needed a pound of freon and added it, checked my brakes and informed me I had about 10k more miles before they needed replaced, and doubled checked my tail lights to confirm all was in good order.
Final price?
only the cost of the Oil Change.
The rest was complimentary!
The world needs more people like Tony Stewart and his team.
Honest and Trustworthy.
Thanks Tony!

I had an issue with my power steering pump slowly leaking.
At least three other repair shops I went to told me that it needed to be replaced for about $400; so I let it leak and filled the fluid occasionally.
Went in for an oil change at Oasis and they told me about the leak and said they could rebuild it for $150!
It has worked fine ever since.
It is so refreshing to find an honest repair shop.

Always honest and the work is done well or it is fixed for free.

Had a resonator to install for my loud turbo back exhaust I just put in.
The folks at Oasis were honest and great to deal with.
They explained exactly what they were up against and how they would be able to help as I had a fit issue below the car.
The end result was great and I couldn't be happier with their service.
Thanks!
