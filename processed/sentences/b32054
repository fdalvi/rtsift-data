This location sucks if you have have to go inside.
The lines are always too long.
They have room for 7 tellers up front but I've only ever seen 2 working.
Managers and "personal bankers" never jump in to help yet you see them walking around or sitting at their desks.

I stopped in today to close an account and transfer it to another account.
After waiting in line behind 8 people and two tellers I am finally told oh you have yo go sit down and talk to someone.
So I go sit down where she told me and waited to be called.
I'm sitting for about 5 mins when the two guys are sitting staring into space.
Another guy comes in and gets greeted by a greeter.
Which by the way, I was not greeted.
This guy takes him right to the someone.
I sit and wait some more and the greeter is standing there.
He sees me sitting and there and two men sitting doing nothing.
I finally get up and say this is ridiculous and I open the door to walk out and the greeter just says have a nice day.
I should have known better than to go in this location.
**Update**  I called the bank just to find out why my reported lost credit card has not gotten here yet.
I was told there were notes in the account but nothing done.
The incompent people of this company is sad, yet almost funny.
I am closing my accounts today!
I give them negative 2 stars so perhaps we need another way of grading these places that don't deserve a star.
