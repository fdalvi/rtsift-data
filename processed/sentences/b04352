What a relief to find honest hard working shop.
Awesome customer service and were quick at getting a big job done.
Thanks so much Kevin and crew.
My 88 Toyota Pickup is happy and so am I.

After moving to Arizona, when looking for a quality provider of automotive service, I was very fortunate to be referred to Sunburst Automotive.
Located just north of Greenway Road on 67th Avenue in Glendale, Sunburst Automotive has been operated by the same family since 1979.
In handling all of my maintenance and repairs, Sunburst Automotive has provided me with EXCELLENT WORKMANSHIP AND TIMELY SERVICE.
In addition to being VERY HONEST, they have saved me a lot on money.
Rather than going to a car dealership, it makes sense to call Sunburst Automotive at 623-979-9214 to schedule an appointment and PAY MUCH LESS FOR FIRST CLASS SERVICE.
At Sunburst Automotive, there is also an added benefit.
They are all VERY NICE PEOPLE !!

Honest, friendly and fair, My wife had a problem with her Escalade, 2 trips to cadaliac and one to GMC and no solution, Sunburst looked at the problem, said its a seal that goes bad on all escalades and it was fixed the same day, i will only go her
