This place is rarely busy, so the two times I've been in, I've been able to get help right away.
However, their prices (for non-contractors at least) are insanely high.
I was in the middle of painting a room and ran out of primer, so I ran over to grab a gallon.
$30 for the basic primer that I bought at a home improvement store for $20.
But, it was closer and I did get back home in time to finish the room before my roller and brush dried out.

First time at this store.
Staff tries to be helpful, though today they were busy and short-handed.
However, it was nice that they would put samples on the wood so we can see what the product will look like on our project.
It's really hard to say much more about it until we apply the product and see how it stands up over time.
I'll update when I can answer that question.

I can truly and accurately say this store has stepped up over the years..
The staff is super nice and extremely friendly and of course very knowledgeable about their paints and other products.
This store understands time is important and they try and get you in and out as quickly as possible with accurate color matching!
If you live in or around Gilbert,AZ..
There is no reason why you would go anywhere else for your painting needs!
Yes Sherwin Williams paints.are a little more expensive than home depot and lowes but like people say.
You get what you pay for and that couldn't be any more true with paint.
I've had bad experiences with cheaper products in the past.
I give this store the A +
