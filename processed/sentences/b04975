Dr. Lawyer is an exceptional optometrist.
He takes his time with you and explains what's happening as he goes along.
I've gone to him for the past several years and have been nothing but exceptionally happy with the service and quality of care that I received there.

Dr. Lawyer does an exceptional job.
He talks to you like you're a real person, and gives you frank advice.
This helps you to make the best decisions and in turn get an optimal result.

Dr. Lawyer is a fantastic doctor.
He spends time with me and makes sure my lenses are perfect!
The office support staff are welcoming, friendly, and efficient.
I have been a patient for more than ten years, I highly recommend Dr.Lawyer.

The office staff is warm, friendly and efficient!
All together I was in and out of the office in about 30 minutes.
Dr. Lawyer himself is great.
He greeted me with a "so what's up?
", which I found funny and actually quite comforting.
He cracked jokes along the way, but still maintained his professionalism.
Some people may be a little put off by this but I think it adds to the "experience", if you would call it that.
Just lighten up and go with it!
The prescriptions they write here are good for two years, which is nice.
So even though it won't be any time soon, I will definitely be back.
