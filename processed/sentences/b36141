Battery went out on my daughters car, they tested it and found out that it was bad.
Very friendly.

Great staff they even installed the light bulbs over my lisc plate for me(it was a hassle too but he didn't mind).
Thank you

I rate a 4 because the customer service with JC needs to improve a little more..
Stopped in tonight to exchange brake pads and get a refund for my brake rotors , overall I do like shopping here for my parts though
