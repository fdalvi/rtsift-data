I am a resident of Fountain Hills, and I have been going to Kim (the owner of Park Avenue)  for my hair coloring and hair cutting needs for over two years.
Kim is professional, patient, and kind, and not only does she do a great job on my hair, she is fun to chat with, too.
I really look forward to seeing her every 6 weeks!
The location of the salon cannot be beat....right next to the lake, park and the fountain in Fountain Hills.
What a beautiful view to enjoy while you are getting your hair cut/colored/permed etc.

I had a negative experience with Kelly.
She was very unprofessional and I was very disapointed.
Didn't listen to what I wanted.
Even when she knew I was unhappy, she let me walk out the door.
Not exactly what you want to be the first experience with a new stylist.

Gina was great!
She is very fun and professional, not to mention she does great work.
Can't wait for my hair to grow so I can go back......

OMG!
Have been looking for a stylist for awhile, since my old stylist moved.
A friend recommended GINA and I think my search has ended.
Never had so much fun, and such a great haircut.
Booked for the rest of the year  Great job Gina!
Thanks.
