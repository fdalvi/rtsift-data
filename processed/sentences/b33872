The worst place ever.
Pathetic staff who are rude and cultureless.
Stay away from this place if you can...

I had the WORST experiences renting from this apartment complex.
I had laundry & laundry baskets stolen from the laundromat, my GAS SYPHONED from my gas tank and gas cap stolen.
I understand that issues such as these may not be the fault of the complex, however issues that WERE in their authority address, they did not.
I was sexually assaulted in the parking lot with my 2-yr-old in the car & with a police report filed and fear for my safety I was not granted the opportunity to break my lease- the office had no compassion and did not even offer to escalate the issue to accommodate me under such horrible circumstances.
The list of issues drags on but I wouldn't recommend these apartments to anyone.

I've lived here for three months almost and have had an "alright" experience.
I say only "alright" because in the time I've lived here, I've had a hit and run on my car that they basically said they'd "ask around" about and I wouldn't doubt never did.
I've had maintenance enter my home WHILE I WAS SLEEPING when I said I didn't want anyone entering without my permission.
The main manager woman in the front office is incredibly rude I.E.
commenting about my personal life in a negative way.
The maintenance do a half-*** job when they do fix something.
The only person working in this complex I like is Nikki.
If I didn't have a lease, I would've left this complex already.
During move in, my apartment was still dirty, wood planks were left in my living room, and there was and is a nasty smell emitting from the water in the showers.
Do yourself a favor and stay FAR away from this complex.
