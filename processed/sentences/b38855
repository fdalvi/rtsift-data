Love love love femme art boudoir photography!!
I hired Pamela for my maternity boudoir photos and it was an amazing experience.
She made me feel so comfortable and beautiful in my own skin.
The photos turned out gorgeous and I was sooo happy I did them.
Since she did such a fantastic job with my boudoir photos I hired her to do more maternity photos of my husband and I, newborn photos and 7 month mommy and me photos.
I have been very pleased with the results of all the photos and Pamela's professionalism and direction during the shooting.

I was researching  to have professional photos taken of me.
I was not taking these pictures for a loved one or honey but instead, for me.
It was important  that the moment in time was captured.
In addition, I felt that the pictures should reflect who I am with sense of creativeness through art photography.
Then I came across Pamela Nicole, Femme Art Boudoir.
There was no doubt in my mind when I saw her website that this was the person who would capture the beauty.
When setting up the appointment, at no point did I feel nervous of what the outcome would be.
Pamela had  high professionalism along with understanding my wants and needs.
During the day of the shoot, I left the creativity in her hands as she snapped away her camera.
When I got the final pictures, I truly had a verklempt (Yiddish for overcome with emotion) moment.
I will cherish these pictures as well as, a friendship I had cultivated with Pamela.
She has also taken portraits of my daughter, in high school.
In the future, I will have a family portrait.
We are just waiting for the removal of braces, for my son.
I honestly believe that there needs to be a connect with you and the photographer and that connection was made.
My deepest thank you, Pamela!

I had an amazing experience with Femme Art Boudior!
Pamela was so kind and professional through out the entire process.
Initially I was very nervous, but Pamela gave great instruction which helped me relax.
The hair & make-up artist, Linda, did an amazing job and ensured that not a hair was out of place during the entire shoot.
The pictures turned out so lovely and was everything that I had hoped they would be.
I would recommend Femme Art Boudior to any woman!
