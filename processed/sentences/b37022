Great urgent care.
Brought my daughter here and there was no wait at all, we were the only ones at the facility at the time.
Doctor was thorough and the offer to obtain the medication on site was offered.
I would return here and would recommend this facility to others.

Awesome urgent care.
After leaving the urgent care on 83rd and Thunderbird for ridiculous rude treatment came here and so soso soso happy!!!!
They were fast and friendly and  respectful to my son and our urgent need.
Thank you thank you.
So glad your close to me.

Very friendly and knowledgable staff.
I have been here twice recently and was in and out  in 20 minutes each time with the proper diagnosis and medications I needed.
I highly recommend Urgent Care.

This is the ultimate in urgent care.
It's new, clean and friendly.
I was impressed with the whole staff.
Had a sinus infection and was able to get the needed care in just a short time.
There was an assistant who was new and doing just fine but the Dr.
Followed up on what she did to make sure the results were correct.
They have a pharmacy on hand and the prices were better than what I would have paid other places.
The pharmacist accompanied the asst as she went over the prescriptions with me.
I even got one prescription free by checking in on Yelp.
I would recommend this place without hesitation.

I just went here for pain when I pee a little pricey but worth it the front desk lady was super nice the PA was really nice and I got meds to help with the pain for 15 a bottle !
