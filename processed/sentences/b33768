HUGE menu, but I stuck with the classic buttermilk pancakes - chocolate chip buttermilk pancakes.
Service was very fast and super friendly.
Easy freeway access.

Waitstaff was super friendly.
Food was great "diner" style, no surprises.
Pancakes were just great, coffee was hot and plentiful.
Food arrived fast - and my waitress even offered to HEAT UP MY SYRUP!!!
Place was extremely clean - I really liked this place.
I ordered the chocolate chip pancakes and they were fantastic.
Waitress was very tentative to our needs.
I'll be back, for sure.

Great service from our server Bryanna.
She was super sweet and attentive.
I'm from San Diego and seriously haven't had someone so great serve us at an Ihop.
