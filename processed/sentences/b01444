I go to Steve (Slava) quite frequently (as in, whenever the hair gets long) and the fact that I drive all the way to his location from my castle in Tempe should tell you that it's for a good reason.
His rates are good, the quality of haircuts is very consistent and you can even ask for a neck shave with an actual straight blade.
He is careful, yet efficient and quick.
Don't forget to tip well!

Steve is one of the few shops that can still do a decent flat top.
He is in my neighborhood, so it is great for me - convenient.
Steve is personable and the shop is inviting.
I love the hot towel and back-vibrator massage.
I have been going to Steve for years, great service product!

A solid cut for a great price.
I will be back.

I came in for a walk-in today and to say I was pleasantly surprised would be a drastic understatement.
Jeff gave me the best haircut of my life and I'd recommend him to anyone.
It's a good friendly atmosphere in the store, and the employees are fun and polite.
The cost was surprisingly low for how much attention he paid to my hair, and I really appreciated that he took his time to make it perfect, even though the cut was done quickly and professionally.
I would recommend this venue to anyone looking for a great men's haircut at an awesome price.

This place is amazing the price is the best in town the hair cuts are on point never had a bad cut here.
It's a family biz and they treat you like your family the barber I use is Jeff all I got to say is you will love your hair cut if you come here!

Only place open on 4th of July!
Jeff did a fantastic job and has a steady hand with a blade.
Definitely coming back!
