They don't have bbq pork any longer.

I love the convenience of panda express and although we have not been happy at other panda expresses, everything we got here was delicious!

Panda Express in Maricopa is alot better than in Casa Grande.
Love it!!

With the exception we waited for about 10-15 minutes in the drive thru, and the employees being just short of mentally handicap....the food was really good, tasted fresh.
The employees don't seem to have a clue what is on their simple menu.
Asked for pot stickers, one of them had no clue.
Would have been quicker to go inside.

Free OC with every order after 9pm tonight only.

Have been a few times for lunch, and they were pretty busy.
Had pretty fast service and the food was good.

Panda with no soup?
What kind of Chinese rest is that?
No bueno.
Atleast some wonton soup.
Asian lady said " we don't even have soup" that's crazy.
Oh well

I've been to may fair share of Panda's and it's sad that our own is really hit and miss, I've had only a few times where I have my sauce I've requested on the side.
They could take a bit more care of the location it seems.
I still go there, but it is a tad on the bad side.
service could use some work as well.
The food,and prices are good, and that's why we keep going back.

Woo whee this place is expensive.
For pre-made cheap Chinese food under a hot lamp my wife and I spent nearly $25!
The food is ok but the prices are outrageous.
