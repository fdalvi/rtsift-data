"Corny" (Cornelius) is a master electrician who takes great pride in every single job he does.
I have used him on several occasions now (home and business), and have always been impressed by his craftsmanship, timeliness, and reasonable rates.
This is a guy you can really trust.

I was referred to Coblentz by a friend, and I am so thankful.
I really respect and trust Cornelius.
He arrived at the time scheduled and his rates were [are] very reasonable.
He has a great energy.
Not that you need that in an electrician...no pun intended...but when I was freaking out, he was calm and cool.
Oh, and he liked my dogs!

I was very happy that I invited Coblentz Electric into my home.
He arrived at the time he said he would and he diagnosed and fixed three concerns within one hour.
I highly recommend "Corny" he is a one person business and does a great job.
You will be pleased with the end result.
