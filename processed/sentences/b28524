Rumblin' Tums is your classic greasy spoon, but it just so happens that I like greasy spoons!
They provide fresh morning rolls, surprisingle gorgeous bran scones and service with a smile!
And the decor inside is clean and fresh, all I'm looking for in a wee cafe!
The outside could do with a lick of paint and the tables and chairs have seen better days, but all in all it fills its purpose.
Perfect for a wee brew off a sunny afternoon!

It's hugely obvious that this place has seen better days - it is most deffinitly in need of a paint and a few new tables and chairs, but really, if you look beyond all these little things, you get a great cafe-come-greasy spoon!
The food here is always plain and simple, but fills you up and tastes great - its all pretty cheap too, and the atmosphere is so friendly that you could sit here all day.
My only other problem was the cleanliness of this place, I wasnt expecting spanking clean - but I also didnt expect to have to wipe my own table of the dried on food from the previous occupant of my seat.
Good food for a good price, shame about some of the little things.

This place is great.
There's a home made feel about the food and this is refreshing in a world full of the big under paid part-time buisiness outlets we have everywhere else.
Dont be put off by the look on the outside as my missus commented on the curtains.
I would have happily given 5 stars, but the main door doesn't shut by itself and needs a spring.
It's been like this for ages and is a pain as there's a lot of people leave it open.

Friendly, personal service and great for breakfast or lunch.
Crispy bacon, quality black pudding and they even have home laid eggs.
Rumblin Tum make loads of speciality cakes as well, to order for special occasions or to enjoy a slice, while in the cafe.
Only drawback is it's quite small, so on busy days you may wait for a table.
