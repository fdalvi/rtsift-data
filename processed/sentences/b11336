Ive been going into Dylan's for about 9 years and it never gets old.
The customers are great and I've made some life long friends.
The bartenders are always friendly and ready to have a good time.
The only thing that could make them better is if they accepted credit/debit cards.
But if youre ever on the east side of town and need a laid back fun place to hang out in, check it out!

My buddies were in town to celebrate my birthday and a friends birthday as well.
We wanted to play a game of pool but we didn't want to be in a busy bar.
So we hit Dylans.
They have a great pool room.
We ordered a couple rounds of drinks and the bartender was great.
She laughed and made us feel welcome.
She made eye contact with us when it was time to order another round.
We played a few games and I think I took one shot the whole time as one of my friends can run the table.
But, that's cool... more power to him.
I have driven past this place many, many times and never thought about pulling in.
I always imagined that the cast of Deliverance would be in a dive bar like this.
I'm not into squealing like a pig.
Anyhow, we had a great time here and it couldn't have been a better experience.
So, since this place is close to home, it may be a new hangout.
We'll see!

I've been a long time customer, and it NEVER gets old.
Great employees, and everybody has a nickname :)) 5 pool tables, putt putt machine, and golden tee.
RANDOM FREE BBQ for all, good times!
