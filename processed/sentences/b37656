MarkieChar Jewelry is exactly what Tivoli needed.
Upstairs above the MarketCafe, snuggled in the corner is this gem of a store.
Specializing in pieces you cant find at your run of the mill jewelry store, and way higher quality than a boutique clothing store.
Thin golds, beautiful rings, leather bracelets, infinity signs, and so much more.
This is my go to to get my amazing little Sis a new item, something that doesn't empty my wallet, is high quality, and she can have forever.
I have bought a few gifts here, both mens and women's and each time they are packaged beautifully and the customer service is 100%.
I love answering those calls from my sister at college that she LOVES what I picked out and she won't be taking it off =)  The layout makes it easy to see everything, and makes me feel like I am exploring someones personal collection, very warm and inviting.
I will definitely be back anytime I need a unique, high quality gift for someone I love.

Cute spot in the Market LV.
Limited selection but they have a few gems (har, har).
I spotted some cute druzy quartz rings, rose gold bracelets, and agate slice necklaces.
Mostly, their stuff consists of dainty jewelry.
I'd prefer some edgier selections, but, it's cool.
I see potential.

I'm picky, period.
I'm not much of a "costume jewelry" fan like at the chain stores as it looks cheap & terrible quality.
BUT...this boutique has amazing pieces.
Some fun/trendy but most are unique, gem stones, leather, diamonds, crystals, leather or even custom pieces.
I'm a HUGE fan of the Good Works line & have something in almost every color.
I've purchased items as gifts here too (I really don't like giving these pieces away) but I do to share the love!
This is my favorite jewelry store in all of Vegas because:  Family Owned, Love the Ladies, unique pieces, custom available & great gifting ideas.
Men & women should shop them, you will definitely find something to put a smile on your special someone's face!
