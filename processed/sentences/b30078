This place has great service, and the best selection of gifts to add to your flowers.
I think its one of the better florists.
One of the only florists in Henderson I think, too.

I recently had a wonderful experience at Springtime Floral and feel that 5 stars were easily earned.
I called in from Reno to have flowers delivered to my friend's birthday party in Henderson.
The service over the phone was extremely friendly and professional.
The floral arrangement was gorgeous.
I have been in this shop several times prior to moving to Reno and have always had a great experience.
They carry unique gifts and balloons in addition to flowers.
The store has a room with a table to discuss wedding flowers and such.
I love this place and it is my go-to florist for Henderson/Las Vegas.

I gave them a 3 because for so many years, my husband has been using them to send me flowers for Valentines Day, Mothers Day, and my Birthday.
For those years they deserve at least the 3 stars because they were efficient in the delivery time and the flowers were always so fresh and beautiful.
Although this years Valentines Day, the flowers were super horrible, and when I say horrible, all my Lillie's were DEAD, and all the greens were already wilting.
That said, I was embarrassed that my whole office had to see the kind of flowers that were sent to me.
Obviously try Weren't fresh.
Not only were the flowers horrible, but my husband called them and let them know about the flowers and they said to come in an they will replace them.
Of course they replaced them with more wilted flowers and didn't even arrange the rest and just left it that way.
Overall was pretty upset that I will not be using them again.

Hours of operation for Sunday are posted as 10-2 .
