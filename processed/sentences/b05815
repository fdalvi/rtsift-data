I am a simple girl.
I don't ask for very much in life....well, maybe with the exception of a date with Miami Dolphin's player Jason Taylor, but other than that, everything else should be pretty attainable.
So with that said,  I would call myself a pretty loyal Best Buy customer until today.
I recently placed a special order because they had the best price for my items that I needed.
I received a call within 4 days saying that it had arrived and I could pick them up at anytime.
I came in the next day to pick up my goodies and wouldn't you know......the bastards lost my order after calling me to say they had it!!
As everyone's favorite cocaine addict Whitney Houston would say "Ahh Hell to the Naw"!!
How do you call a customer to say that you have their order and once they arrive say it is no where to be found!!
Unbelievable!!
I mean come on....is The Cosby Show Season 4 DVD and Expose's Greatest Hits to much to ask for??!!
(Yes...you all can laugh now cause I have dated myself....and sorry Diana, you were the one that gave me the original and I have felt a void in my CD collection ever since I misplaced it, so I guess people can laugh at you too!!
) It's really not that hard...I was so disappointed with the customer service.
Won't be back or placing any special orders anytime soon!!
+1 star for giving me some sort of comfort in my upset state.
Beverly Hills 90210 Season 1 was on sale....I guess I could settle with that for a while....and yes...you can laugh once again!

2nd visit to this best buy ( closest to my lv pad ) ... i was pleased with the customer service ( psot-christmas so the place ain't to busy ) ..several employees offered assistance and smooth, easy, pleasant service at the return counter.
my beef, if an item is not on sale ...it ain't cheap !!
cd's, dvd's.
games...i have a feeling walmart's got them beat... my other beef ...not really best-buy's fault but too bad ....the shopping center has no traffic lights going into the center so it's a pain in the ass leaving the center - especially in the late afternoon ...this is going to be a huge problem soon when all the stores open ( it's a damn big shopping center )

Went into this Best Buy to get my laptop charger replaced since after 2 years, it shorted out and died.
Went straight up the Geek Squad area where I explained my situation, and gave him my paperwork since I had insurance on the laptop and hoped that the insurance would cover the charger.
It did, but here is the catch - it takes 1-2 weeks to ship.
Are you freaking kidding me!?
You would think this is something they would stock as you know, it's pretty integral to me using my computer.
It is shipping straight to my house and at no charge, but wow would that be a wait.
Otherwise, I could have paid $80-130 on a universal power adapter.
Cheese and rice.
The customer service was great, the guy I spoke to was nice and got through my transaction quickly, but I really hate dealing with Best Buy in general and having to wait up to 2 weeks for a part on my computer is ridiculous.
Boo Geek Squad, boo.

Situation: Needed a Camera Battery... for a Lumix DMC-FX07.
Price: $50.00 (Gulp!
Choke, choke.. Heart Attack!
Call the Paramedics!
)  Rating: 1 Star.
Comment: Must be the Designer-Battery made by Gucci... and of Gold.
The Pics can wait!

When I go to Best Buy, I usually know what I'm looking for.
So I have no beef with the prices.
Also, since I do all tech support myself, I don't have a beef with the Geek Squad or warranty either.
Now, this particular Best Buy is my least favorite in town because it's old and not as clean as the others, which is the reason for my 3 Stars.
The employees here are satisfactory, but not great.
The store serves it's purpose for my needs, which is to satisfy my fix for electronics immediately.
I normally buy electronics & computer equipment online because it's cheaper for the same products.....however, every once in a while I'll need to have my fix and if I'm not in the mood to drive to Fry's I'll stop by here.
My last visit, which was yesterday....my son was shopping for his 1st cell phone.
We went to take a look at various models from different companies.
One great thing about Best Buy is that they have all of the major cell companies under one roof so we don't have to drive all over Blazed Egypt to browse.
After screwing around the cell phone area we wandered over to the Xbox 360 aisles......yeah, I got Fuschnickened by my son into "taking a look" at some games......$100 bucks later I had to explain to wifey why we were coming home with video games after a cell phone expedition.
Plus, we ended up at Game Stop after this Best Buy trip.
Will I return?
The next time I start shaking and need a new gadget....possibly.

I just have to say that one of the employees of this store was very helpful.
I forgot her name.
She really did more than a hundred percent to really help me with my questions.
I am sure that her fellow co-workers are the same when it comes to treating their customers.
So I highly recommend this Best Buy store.
For sure, any business establishments definitely should have the best customer service no matter what kind of services or products they sell, and this store, exemplified by this employee, definitely is up there, so I give them the highest rating: five stars.

me and my boyfriend were on a mission to buy an external hard drive for my macbook.
so he went online and compared with other companies, and we came to the conclusion that best buy had the better deal for a 1 terabyte drive.
so we decided to go to the actual best buy.
when we got there, all the workers were bubbly and asked if we needed anything, that they were there to help.
cool.
because its so inconvenient when you have a question at that very moment and no associate is there to help out.
we got to the section for hard drives, an associate was there to help.
my boyfriend saw a model online seagate brand, 1 terabyte, for $80 and they weren't carrying any models that we saw online.
one missing star.
they had models starting at 130.
So we settled with a different one.
its frustrating when there's limited selection from their full online catalog.
understandable.
but we dont want to end up having to order onine and pay for shipping.
the great customer service alleviated the frustration.

I go to this location a lot because it is very close to my home.
Every time I have been, the staff is quick to assist and very well versed with the inventory.
Best Buy has always been my favorite when it comes to electronics and gadgets.

Came here after i asked audio express about installing a car stereo in my lexus.
Their installers at audio express said they would charge me 150$ on top of the overpriced head unit to wire it in to my lexus, because it is a complicated car with in line amplifiers.........AND THEY SAID THERE WAS NO WAY TO MAKE MY FACTORY SUBWOOFER WORK.
Went to BEST BUY and 60$ and 20 min later everything worked beautifully, same head unit, half price.
Ask for patrick at best buy on rainbow!

They were awesome from the moment I walked in the door until I walked out.
My laptop was broken some how and the battery wouldn't go in, the tech helped me immediately fixed it explained how to avoid it happening again and all for no charge :) Not to mention it all took less than 10 minutes!

It is a pleasure to know I have had my last trip ever to Best Buy!
Not only do they not have what you want they tell you that with a resentful attitude because I interrupted a jovial conversation between friends and employees.
Sorry...
I thought a customer that wanted to spend money took prescidence over you best buds visiting you at work.
I have grown accustomed to truly awful service at Best Buy but they generally had what I needed.
Now, why bother!
My tip for dealing with Best Buy... Go to www.newegg.com and sell the stock BBY short.
They won't be around too much longer!

Geek squad sucks, no customer service, no order or organization, horrible communication

Wost customer service ever.
I came here to purchase a brand new labtop on a wenesday night.
I stood around looking for about 5 minutes before someone asked me if I needed assistance.
After another 15 minutes of waiting the same worker asked if anyone had come over yet.
Finally someone came over.
At this point I figured they had enlisted their top notch elite to come assist me, I was sadly mistaken.
They sent some hourly moron who didn't know anything about labtops.
She just read the description right below it.
I asked to speak to the manager and they directed to some schlub named bill who just said sowwwyyyyy.
Thanks a lot idiots next time I'll go to fry's

The staff isn't always the most knowledgeable, but I don't expect them to be experts at retail wages.
They're friendly, and generally do their best to help, which is all I can ask for.
My male and I stop in here more often then I would like to.
They have the best selection electronics, at least unless I want to drive all the way to Frys.
Higher end keyboards, mice, headphones, cell phone cases, this is the place to go.
The store is clean and pretty easy to get around.
I especially love the cell section.
They have all the main phones from all the major brands, and a number of prepaids as well to look at, and of course, the huge selection of accessories.
The only downfall to Best Buy is the prices.
If they could be just a little more competive with online prices, they'd be my main spot for electronics, in stead of that,"Oh crap, my keyboard just died" place.

This is my local Best Buy, and what can you say about Best Buy that hasn't already been said?
Absolutely nothing, so I'll shut up now.

This is my goto Best Buy.
The only reason I'm making this a 4 is because of Heather at the Best Buy Mobile kiosk.
She provides super customer service.

I try not to go to best buy too much because the store has changed and for me difficult to  navigate ( I know I sound like an old person)!
Anyways I came here to check out the laptops as mine was in the process of dying.
There were seriously about 5 staff members standing in front of the store having personal conversations and two patrons, myself included waiting to be helped in the computer section.
Greater than 5 minutes time before someone finally acknowledged that we needed help.
They sent over a young lady who i'm sure was very nice but she had NO knowledge of computers?!?!
I was dumbfounded.
Really, thats what you send over and i'm about to drop mad money on a comp!!
I was preparing to leave when a nice young man relieved her and assisted me.
He is the only reason I will EVER return to that best buy.

I am the first to admit I have been behind the times.
I decided it was about time to bite the bullet and buy a blu-ray player.
I walked into the mecca of electronics feeling a little apprehensive.
This store is HUGE.
Although there seemed to be signs everywhere pointing to home audio, electronics, appliances, etc., I couldn't find blu-ray players.
After wandering around somewhere between refrigerators and home audio, I finally stumbled upon blu-ray players.
The selection was great.
There were probably 10 different ones to choose from and each had a little description next to it explaining why this one was better than the next.
A few were even on sale.
I decided on a samsung "smart" player with netflix, youtube, etc.
for $88.
Next, I was on the lookout for some Disney flicks.
I was surprised to find that Disney was it's own catagory in the DVD section but the selection was pretty limited.
I knew Peter Pan had just been released but it was nowhere to be found.
It wasn't until I was checking out that I stumbled on a randomly placed rack of newly released movies.Here I found Peter Pan and Argo so I was a very happy girl.
The cashier was very polite and only asked once if I had a rewards card.
I understand It's their job to promote the card and ask if I have one, but it's a pet peeve of mine when cashiers hound you over and over to get a rewards card or credit card.
This cashier did none of that so I left in a great mood and will probably revisit the next time I'm in need of electronics.

I've bought a lot of electronics here.
Most of the time, the service is better than average.
There will always be those employees that seem like they have less knowledge on the items than you.
I've had great experiences where the employee is wandering around checking in on people and happens to see me looking at video games, asks me what kind I like, my budget, and age rating.
Shows me several that he recommends.
I bought 3 when I only wanted 1.
(Not using pressure tactics).
The reason I bought 3?
Because I saw how much he loved what he was doing here.
He loved electronics, was knowledgeable, andthat makes people buy.
If you can't find what you like or need someone knowledgeable on a particular item, go to the greeter and tell them.
Its their job to make you buy.
Also, they don't advertise price matching but they've done it for me several times.

Went to purchase a pair of headphones to use while working out.
I had some questions about brands and which ones would better suit my needs.
Unfortunately I did not receive any help from anyone the entire time I was in the store.
Salespeople were everywhere, walking past me, talking in groups, standing around, but not once did ANY of them ask if I needed help or had a question.
In fact, only one of the employees was even nice enough to smile when they walked by.
The shelves were not stocked very well with the product I was interested in, and I ended up giving up and walking out without buying anything.
I purchased my $150 headphones later that day at a competing store, and will not return to this Best Buy.
Stay away!

My 'dumb phone' shorted out.....today was the day for an upgrade!!!
I headed straight to BB and did a B-line to the cell phones.
I grabbed the $59.00 LG840 Tracfone  and waited in line to ask a simple question "Will the sim card for my old Tracfone work in this new one?
"    I was next in line, feeling great about my pending purchase, when a tech named Martin broke away from his existing guest to ask if I wanted to get this phone activated or was I just looking to purchase it ???
I replied 'well I have a question...' Martin continued with....' Yeah cause if you just wanted to purchase the phone you can head to the front cashier....but (with an anxious look) if you wanted to get the phone activated, it would take me over an hour for us to activate that phone'.
I was absolutely embarrassed.
I felt like I didn't belong....Just because I wasn't buying a Galaxy S IIII or an iPhone 5 doesn't mean I don't matter.
Martin missed the opportunity to make a connection with a guest, to up sale to a better phone.....or even sell two.
No, all I heard was 'It's not worth my time to help you'.
Martin looked at my purchase and immediately cast judgement.
Best Buy ran an ad campaign highlighting the ease & simplicity their guest will find in purchasing a phone from them.
The ad even mentioned they will set the phone up for you, I've brought 3 phones over the past 2 years from BB.
I drove past 5 locations along Rainbow that sold this same phone, just to Buy from the Best.
Thanks Martin, you single-handedly  changed my opinion of an entire brand.

Usually have a normal time getting what I need or want from best buy..
But..
The last 3 times I wanted to find a cd, all 3 attempts were failed!
Very poor cd section now..
I still like owning the actual cd!

I had a horrible experience buying a phone and I will never purchase another phone from Best Buy again!
Even though I got a good deal, the experience was horrible and I ended up losing on the deal.
I originally went there to purchase a phone and had no intentions of trading my old phone in.
After a very long wait in the "phone activation" line I finally got to the front and got the process started.
I had one person, who was very friendly, start my activation for me.
He persuaded me to turn in my old phone-saying that they offer a much better trade-in value than Sprint.
I was impressed by the amount they were willing to give me for my phone, it was indeed a better deal.
My biggest concern was that I would lose information off of my phone that I did not already have backed up or had transferred to my home computer.
The person behind the counter assured me that it was not an issue and that I had nothing to worry about!
He said that he could transfer everything to my new phone, including my text messages!
That is not what happened at all!
The first person that helped me got "distracted" with another guest right in the middle of helping me with my contract!
He sent another person over to help me, and then a different person and so on.
I ended up with 5 different people helping me with the process and nothing was completed!
No one could find my paperwork and more importantly, no one could figure out how to transfer my pictures over to my new phone!
They were about to close and I had to leave, after being there for over 2 hours, only to be told I need to come back tomorrow so that they can try again!
They kept my old phone since it now "belongs to them" and told me that "hopefully" it will still be here tomorrow when I come back so that they can try again!!
TRY again!!
I was so upset when I left there!
All of my personal information and my pictures that meant more to me than buying a new phone ever will- could possibly get lost!!
I had to go back the next evening after work and start the transfer process all over again!
AGAIN, I dealt with 5 different people, and spent over 2 hours there!
Only to leave with what they told me was all they could do.
They promised me that all of my pictures were there even though at one point I was told that only some of them could transfer and they couldn't even figure out why!!
But the store was already closed and they wanted me out of there, so I left with the hopes that everything was transferred as promised!
I got home to find out that over 200 pictures were missing!!
I was so upset!!
I tried to call the store the VERY SECOND they opened the next morning only to be told by a supervisor that my phone was probably already erased and shipped out and there was nothing she could do about it!!
She also proceeded to tell me that they don't guarantee that all of your personal information can be transferred and it was my fault for not backing everything up before I gave them my phone!!!
WHAT?!?
My fault??
I had no intentions on trading my phone in for that very reason!
But the salespeople assured me that everything would be there!
At no time was I told that there was even a possibility that they could only do a partial transfer!
And BTW, the supervisor (who was supposed to research the issue to see if my phone was already gone) never even called me back as promised!
The entire experience was a chaotic mess and I would never purchase another electronic item from them again!
I dealt with so many different people that no one knew what was going on!
Even though i asked several times, I never got a copy of my contract, never got the points on my card for the purchase, and left with only 2/3 of my pictures!
(just important family memories!
nothing to be concerned about!
)  Such a huge disappointment!
They should be more concerned about customer service rather than just trying to sell phones and get us in and out like cattle!

The best but truly.
They price match and have an awesome rewards program.
I've purchase floor models for excellent prices stacked up rewards and was able to purchase a surround sound system and my playstation 3 limited addition with games.
Alot of people don't know about there refurbished items online which are decently priced.
One thing I've always loved is there warranty options through the store it's awesome.
One piece of good advice I've ever received is always spend money on items you can afford to replace immediately.
So far I had a XXL Nintendo and iPad I had used the warranty with and there was no hassle and easy replacement.

Horrible customer service.
I received a Black Galaxy Tab 3 8GB, which is a Best Buy exclusive, as a gift from a work party.
Didn't have a receipt but gave them the phone number that was related to the original purchase.
When I tried to return it for store credit they refused to do it at this location even after I gave them everything they needed.
The employee that was looking up the information for the purchase kept telling me there was no proof of purchase and they probably wouldn't take it because I didn't have the original receipt.
He went back to talk with the manager but the story didn't change.
I left that store and called another Best Buy in town, gave them the phone number and they found the purchase immediately.
They even had a copy of the receipt ready for me when I got in and we had a gift card in five minutes.
Don't plan on ever going to this store again

Went in yesterday to get my hardware for wifi set up.
Per my apartment manager, all I needed was a CAT5 and a router.
I'm not a computer expert, so I decided to wait in line for an employee to double check my purchases prior to leaving.
This is one of the only times I've had to find and wait for an employees  attention at this chain rather than be asked if I needed assistance while wandering the department.
Very unusual.
Even walking through other area of the store, I walked past countless employees and was never addressed.
Computer dept staff tried to upsell me on a $200 modem/router combo, despite my clear explanation that I literally have a one bedroom unit with less than three devices and don't even need a modem in the first place.
Seemed disgruntled when I declined and opted for the $50 wifi router that perfectly met my needs instead.
When checking out, staff chatted with one another casually about their "stupid manager" and only addressed me to ask if I wanted to Purchase insurance/warranty and if I had a Rewards Zone card.
Unimpressed with the blue shirts for the first time.
Won't return to this location.

Absolute worst service I have ever had in retail!!
Would be zero stars if I could!
Went in looking for a router.
No body was in the department but two employees were across the isle.
Asked for help and they called someone on the radio.
4 mins later one said someone was on the way.
A few mins later watched two employees sit down to watch tv!!
Walked to customer service explained this to them and went back to the routers.
After another 3 mins watched another employee walk over to the two watching tv, laugh, look at me, pulled out his phone and walked away!
Immediately after him another employee grabbed his phone and did the same thing!!!
I had enough and walked out!
As I passed the service desk they tried to stop me and said they will be right there.
Ha!!!
To late.
They get paid to help people find what they are looking for, they failed.
My time is worth more to me than this.
I will not be back.

Best Buy used to be my one stop computer shop for my Dell laptop in the past.
Through my experiences with purchasing my old laptop here, I have learned that:  (1) Repairs are way too expensive here.
I was better off taking it to a 3rd party repair shop!
(2) Geek Squad is not as knowledgable as they say they are.
(3) It takes way TOO long to fix issues.
Once it took almost a month to get my computer back!!
In general, this location is constantly understaffed and understocked!
Every staff member I ran into was just too busy to assist, which was really unfortunate because I was planning to buy a laptop.
When I went to find someone to help me about two computers, they told me the differences and similarities between the 2 (they didn't know much), and then I unfortunately found out that the one that I wanted wasn't in stock even.
After that, I went to purchase a game for a 3DS and it wasn't in stock either :(   On the bright side, they do offer special services like overpriced warranties, price matching(thank GOD), and a loyalty reward card.
Don't get me wrong, I like Best Buy, but there are definitely better locations.

No customer service fully staff not one employee greeted you and ask if you needed help.

I used to love Best Buy.
This was my place to get CDs on the cheap.
Now CDs are harder to come by with  the popularity of digital music which I have not fully accepted as of yet.
But what little stock Best Buy has now is just sad and disorganized.
They just don't seem to care about organizing or restocking the shelves.
It is so hard to determine if the have what I am looking for because a CD from say Rammstein for example may not be in the R section.
Instead try looking for it in the K's just because.
The apathy does not end there.
Across the store the staff just seems to be going through the motions.
Like they are ask if you need assistance not because they want to help but because it is their job and they get paid to ask.
It is uncomfortable to be in there shopping these days.

Best to buy somewhere else!!!
With the ability to purchase items online, free shipping and just the simple access to the massive range of products over the internet, you would think places like Best Buy with actual stores would pull up there socks and make people realize it's still ok to go to the store and see products first hand before purchasing!
Well not at this store....
I purchased a smart tv just recently at another Best Buy and had an poor experience, so naturally id try another store.
I was there to grab a laptop, I knew what I wanted.
It was a simple walk in, purchase and leave.
Nothing crazy, an easy sell for the staff.
1) waiting 15 or so minutes for a staff member to even show up (had to ask the geek squad if they sold laptops) 2) Being rude and acting like your hassling the staff because you were there purchasing something (if people purchase they have a job, it's simple) 3)The security guard in the yellow shirt leaning on his post, guts hanging out with a untucked Tshirt.
(FYI this isn't about weight, it's about looking respectable)  Everyone knows best buy its on the expensive side, but I guess the excuse is that products are in store and you can go see them before purchase.
I'm guessing this is it.
I'm done with Best Buy, I'd rather go anywhere elsewhere.
As a product it's great, but with staff like this Best Buy will be the next Blockbuster.
Overall Product range: 2-5 Cleanliness: 4-5 Service: 1-5 Coming back: Nope

I normally would go to the Summerlin Best Buy but, they were out of Apple lightning USB charger cables so I went to the next closest one which is this store.
Worst Best Buy I've ever been to.
Workers seem to have absolutely no urgency to help customers.
When I went to check out they always ask if you have a Best Buy rewards account, the guy at the register didn't ask so I asked him to please enter my info he said that's a stupid program.
I won't be going back to that store ever!

This Best Buy is alright.
They usually don't have things in stock and I pretty much don't want to go there for a while because I was on hold for about 15 minutes so I entirely gave up.
