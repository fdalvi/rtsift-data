Hmmm Guacamole 6$ burger.
food - tasty burgers, as far as fast food goes, i think they have a tasty, Caloricly suicidal, burger...next to Burger King..i think it is the most flavorful and good (not saying good for you tho).
also, i think they got new fries..because they were pretty damn good.
location - ummm could be worse.
needs a refresher, remodel.
employees - very nice.
not bitter fast food workers.
brought food to my table and i didn't need to leave a tip.
corner of Washington and 24th street.

Tried the new Big Carl.
Not bad, but I don't need a whole head of letuce just clumped on the damn thing.
Come on Carl.
Put some effort into it.

For fast food, this is some pretty good stuff!
I had some chicken fingers and a chicken cesar wrap.
it was good for $4.

I feel silly giving a five star review to a fast food place but the service here was the best I've had at a fast food restaurant!
Props to the lady working the front today, 11/12/13 4:30pm.
Very helpful and sweet.
The food was fresh and very tasty too.
Two thumbs up :)
