Its starbucks!
Its friendly, has a consistent taste anywhere you go and free wifi!
And a starbucks in a shopping mall is one of the best things!
After a few hours of shopping, and trying on too many things that don't fit or make you look fat, its just perfect to get a nice latte and relax!
There is plenty of seating and there is even a roped off section in the mall (outside the store) for starbucks only seating!
I love my starbucks so really I'm always happy to see one around!

I'm a Caff√® Nero fan myself (I have a few months supply of their beans at home), however, needs must when nowt is around.
I had a Triple Espresso using their Ethiopian Blend as I wanted it ASAP (as STRONG as possible).
It did not disappoint.
I also chose an "All day breakfast bap".
This was ok and filled a gap, but, that's it really.
Pleasant service.
Indoor & outdoor seating.
