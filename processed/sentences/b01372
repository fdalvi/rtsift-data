Cleaner than any other QT I have ever been to.
Very well stocked.
Pleasant experience each time.

I have been to this Quick Trip several times over the past 8 years.
It's easy to get in and out of and normally there is always a few spots open to pump my gas.
It's also conveniently located.
I can stop here on my way to work and still be on time.
I don't usually go inside, but the inside is nice (for a gas station!
) and easy to navigate.
Overall, I really like this Quick Trip and would rather to go any Quick Trip than a different gas station around the valley.

This QT is just a short distance from the 51 Freeway and is a great spot to grab some gas if needed and all your snacks and drink needs.
Very busy location so be careful driving in and out.
