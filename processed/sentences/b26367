This is an Arco - AM/PM Mart as well.
I have never actually gotten gas here so I couldn't tell you whether you should or not (but gas is gas so I'm assuming its not bad).
But I do eat food from the AM/PM Mini Mart here all the time.
For the hot food prices you really can't get a much better deal.
They have Hot Dogs, Burgers, Corn Dogs, Chicken Sandwiches, BBQ Rib Sandwiches, Pizzas and Burritos.
Prices for these generally range from 79cents to $1.99.
No complaints there.
I haven't gotten sick from the food yet so I'm assuming its not that terrible.
Generally I go here because I work for a company that works at Luxor but does not have access to Luxors EDR (Employee Dining Room).
Not a bad deal for the hot-stuff but the regular stuff is a bit overpriced from other gas stations but this is on the strip across the street from Luxor so what do you expect?
Not a bad stop for a quick and really cheap hot sandwich.
Just don't expect the people at the counter to be friendly (at least during the day).

Really should be a 0 star because the guy at the counter pissed off my boyfriend for no good reason!
Terrible service!
Not a good way to start off our drive back home.
But Arco gas is cheap.
But still that doesn't make up for terrible service!
lol

It Has Gas, My Car Needs Gas.

when it comes to vegas gas prices..you know you got a deal.
Cheap gas prices at this location as of yesterday 1/8/12 at $3.27 per gallon, not bad.
