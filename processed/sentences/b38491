In short, Goochi Pooch rocks.
I've had Estelle looking after our cat for a while now.
She always sends a text or email to let me know how the cat is doing and the cat is always pretty relaxed when I get back (as opposed to her usual separation anxeity).
I couldn't recommend her more highly.

Estelle is so outstanding with dogs, she should have her own TV show.
She plays with them, sings to them, makes up her own songs just for the doggies, and my two are mesmerized by her.
When I have to be away for the whole day/evening, I ask her to come over and take them out in the yard and stay for an hour or so.
She comes over at exactly the time I asked for, but she always spends MORE time playing with them.
She always leaves me a note letting me know what they did and how the dogs were.
Sometimes, she sends an email to check on us (to make sure I got home alright!
)  She is DOGGIE EARTH MOTHER, and I recommend her to the max.

My puppy, Buster LOVES this pet sitting service, and you will too.
Estelle is the best!
Your dog is her dog.
She loves them and takes great care of them like her own.
She is always in touch with you about your baby.
I would highly recommend Goochi Pooch Pet Services!
