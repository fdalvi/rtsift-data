It's 7 eleven.
It is what it is- a quickie stop.
I've been to some quick stops where night people are intense- either seems cracked out or paranoid you're going to steal.
The night people are nice and easy going.
Shockingly the donuts are good and fresh.
Someone mentioned its from a local donut shop, but didn't know which.

It's everything you would expect from 7-Eleven.
It's clean and well maintained.
You have your usual selection of great beverages and the normal 7-Eleven food.
Nothing that you would want to eat everyday but sometimes you need that calorie bomb that can only be satisfied by 7- Eleven.

They have a new policy that you must spend $5 to use cc or debit.
I don't always carry cash and just stop in for a soda or coffee.
They have my favorite tea which is the only reason I started coming here.
Short line express is across the street and they have no problem with how little you spend for a cc and they people are great.
I will be going there now.
BTW, not all 7 elevens gave this policy.
The owners are just being cheap.

It's hard to write a review and keep it specific to the store.
What can I say, the store itself is a 7-eleven, you get 711 service and products and gotta love them Slurpee's.
This location itself is Vampyric... as in; during the day the location is nice and peaceful but at night the monsters come out.
I live in the area and had to come here late the other night and it was bad, you had  cars full of young adults playing music so loud I could barely hear.
A gentleman was inside the store intoxicated trying to start fights with patrons.
I thought for a moment I was on Boulder hwy.
I got my big gulp, paid for it, and couldn't get out of there fast enough.
The parking lot itself is not well lit and there is no security to keep the paying customers feeling safe.
