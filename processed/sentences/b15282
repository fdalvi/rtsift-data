Robek's is yummy.
They've got me addicted to what ever they call their concoction with OJ, Strawberries, Blueberries, frozen yogurt, and I get soy protein and/or vitamins added.
They are a little higher priced than Jamba, but they taste way better.
Jamba's vitamin add-in always makes my smoothies taste like one of my high-school science teachers always smelled -- like alternating between sticking your nose in a freshly opened bottle of vitamins and and in an old lady's butt --  but Robek's doesn't taste like that; their's is good.
The staff always gives you a friendly hello, the second you walk through the door, the ultra-promptness of which makes it seem a bit fake at times.
Service is pretty quick and efficient for a smoothie joint.
Never had the food, but they offer very limited assortment of prepacked sandwiches.
If you're cheap like me, watch for BOGO smoothie coupons in the newpaper circulars a few times a year.

If you are a calorie counter, this is the place to grab a filling drink.
Less than 300 calories for a medium smoothie that will hold over any appetite (I'm a big dude) the prices might be a little high, but well worth it for the once in awhile visit.

Pretty darn good smoothies, pricey but worth it for sure.
I'm not a huge fan of smoothie places overall, but this one is worth stopping by every once in a while.

Lots of great choices for pre or post workout or for anytime you want to enjoy something healthy!
Friendly staff Clean shop Protein bars Specials New drinks  I definitely enjoyed my first visit and plan on coming here more often.

I order ahead of time because making fresh juices from vegetables takes some effort.
For the most part, my order is ready when I arrive.
Nice staff.

I am in love with this place.
there has got to be more in phoenix
