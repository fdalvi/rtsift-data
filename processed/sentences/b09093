St. Anthony feels like home the second you get there.
Immediately, you are greeted by people that are genuinely happy to see you- whether you've been going there for years or it's your first time.
The church itself is gorgeous, the people are wonderful, and the ministries that St. Anthony has allow anyone to find what their passion is.
St. Anthony has a heart for their local and global communities, as demonstrated by their community-to-community relationship with Takwe, Rwanda through Food for the Hungry.
Check it out- you'll never want to leave!

We have been coming to St Anthony's for over two years and have been touched by the members of this congregation and their focus on "doing" ministry.
They literally take the Gospel message and go out to visit the sick or needed (Westminster Village), feed the hungry (East Valley Mens Shelter) and clothes the naked (Vista del Camino).
We were also struck by their music and young children's program.
It's really great being in a church with so many children on Sunday!

Friday night dinner at "Tony's".
Great food and even better people.
Too bad this only happens once a year.
