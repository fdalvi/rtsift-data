My wife went to this salon and absolutely loved the result!!!
The stylist, Ghada, listened to what she wanted and did a superb job in doing the perfect highlights (color and thickness) and cut.
She hasn't found a good salon since we've moved here from San Francisco.
I would definitely recommend this place, we'll both be going back!!

I have been going to Ghada for over 15 years.
My husband and I laugh because I've been with her almost as long as I've been married to him.
Ghada is a true professional in every way.
Courteous, polite, fair, very reasonably priced and a real genius with color.
I can't even begin to count the number of times over the years that complete strangers have stopped me to compliment me on my color, cut or both.
Do yourself a favor and give Ghada a try.

Wow Ghada is amazing!
I have really thick hair and no one in Arizona can do my hair like her!
She is now my hairstylist my moms hairstylist my aunts hairstylist my best friends hair stylist and other friends
