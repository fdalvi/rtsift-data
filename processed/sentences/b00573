After moving to Central Phoenix... 2 years ago...
I figured it was finally time to find myself a new dentist.
Like any modern girl, I asked all of my facebook friends for a referral, and ended up with a glowing recommendation of Dr. Davis's practice.
Since it had been a little too long between cleanings, the process took a long time and wasn't exactly pleasant... but I'm fully aware that this was my own doing.
I was incredibly impressed at how meticulous the hygienist was, and she was super friendly too.
Dr. Davis was fantastic (and I'm not just saying this because he told me I don't have any cavities!).
He was personable, responsive to my questions, and very knowledgeable.
I'm happy to have found a new dentist and am (sort-of) looking forward to my next visit... which will be soon, of course!

Having struggled with an infected tooth for several days, a good friend recommended Dr. Davis.
I called their office at 8:45am and was able to see the doctor at 9:30am.
The staff was courteous, friendly and professional.
They took an x-ray and then consulted with me while showing me the x-ray and the huge amount of infection.
Dr. Davis wrote a prescription for antibiotic and pain killer and said go home, rest and take care of yourself and come back in a week so we can do some work on that tooth.
AMAZING attitude and so professional yet personable.
I will be referring Dr. Davis for sure!
Thank You Dr. Davis and staff!

I rarely give anyone a perfect score because I always think there is room for improvement but I have to admit that Dr Davis's office is near perfect.
I just moved here from out of state and was nervous about finding a new dentist since I've had a lot of past dental work.
Their staff is very nice and professional.
Ann the hygienist was super nice and very good.
Overall a very good experience.
