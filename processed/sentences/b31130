Camelot Granite, LLC is very easy to work with.
They have a great selection of kitchen granite counter tops for your kitchen remodeling needs.
They also have many granite colors for your bathroom remodeling.

I called Robert of Camelot Granites on Thursday.
On Friday, he came to my house with samples.
By Sunday afternoon, my granite was installed.
The installation is beautiful.
My kitchen looks so much nicer.
I had been delaying installation of granite for years as every quote from the big boys was more than I wanted to spend.
Robert completed the same job for about half the price.
I'm very pleased with the product and the service.
