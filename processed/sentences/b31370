We are new to the discus arena and we LUCKED out in finding Spirits of the Amazon.
We bought our first fish from a fish store, all of them came sick and died within 2 weeks.
We bought our second group from Spirit of Amazon and they have been amazing to work with.
They have offered us Newbies plenty of advice and support.
We truly appreciate the time and effort they have made to help us be successful.
Jamie has been AMAZING!

It's nice having private Discus sellers in the valley!!
If you want beautiful healthy Discus that are not over priced like they are in fish stores, then this is the place to go!
They have an amazing selection and get new fish in all the time.
Don't waste your time or money with fish stores.
The location is a little out there (for me anyways) but it is well worth the drive to avoid over inflated shipping rates, hiked up prices and sick fish.
This is a business you can trust.
Thanks guys!!
My babies are thriving!!

This is not a store!
Don't waste your time they sell subpar fish out of their living room.
They charge more than other pet stores in the area.
The discus fish I got grew up to be a different kind of discus than what they sold it to me as and it never got pretty like they told me it would when it matured.
They told me it was a going to be a scarlet dragon discus and a year later and its still brown but the other discus I got at another pet store are amazing beautiful and cost less than what spirits of the amazon charged me for!
