Great place for a haircut.
Real barbers for men and stylists for the women.

Great place - Tracy is the Best!!

Best haircut in Glendale-- I have been to other barbers as well.
Johnny B's know how to give you a good head/neck massage, steam shave and taper- these are long lost art forms that are traditional to the art but relaxing and helps stress.
This also shows you that they have quality and know how to take their time.
It's not a farmed out process, where they "churn and burn" customers- each haircut I have gotten there is a quality job.
Ask for Mike, he is my favorite barber over there.
