I hired Terry to perform some basic dry wall repair as I prepared to list my house.
His sheetrock repair skills were exactly what I was looking for.
In addition Terry had alot of good advice to help my house achieve that "WOW" factor when potential buyers come through.

I went through several Handymen that I didn't care for.
So, I decided to use YELP to find one that was reliable.
Since Terry was rated a five star, I decided to give him a try.
I had several plumbing problems as well as drywall repair that required a professional.
I am glad I gave Yelp a try after several bad experiences with Handymen.
Terry was professional and reasonably priced.
He knew his business and did all of the repairs in one day.
I would definitely refer Terry if you are in need of a reliable and experienced Handyman.
Thanks Terry!

We had recessed lights installed and with a few other electrical additions to the house.
Terry and Mike did a great job.
They were very professional and friendly, and the estimate was in line with the final cost.
I strongly recommend the service for a job well done.
