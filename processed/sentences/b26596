Its a standard Subway.
Unfortunately some employees speak barely english, which makes ordering or asking questions extremly hard.
Now, English is my second language too, but at least I able to communicate pretty good.... One lady tends to be rather rude, and ignores people and/or their questions.
She sighs a lot when you ask her if she would please (Yes we always say please and thank you!
) put more dressing on the sandwich or whatever.
Literally, she sigh's!
Maybe i would be too if I had to work at Subway and all those americans come in and order in english but I dont speak nor do I understand english.
How rude of us to order in english!

An average Subway restaurant, the people were nice and quick.
Smells like wonderful fresh baked bread and the facility was clean.

The employees here never smile.
Maybe they are all having a bad day but jeez where is the friendly customer service?
