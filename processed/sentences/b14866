Ask for Bobbie,  She was very helpful.
I flew into airport, taxied to her office and took a U-Haul south to move my mom out.
It could not have been easier.

Moving is stressful enough, the Camelback U-haul location eased the process and even made the process fun.

WOULD GIVE NEGATIVE 1,000 STARS IF I COULD.
I was PHYSICALLY ATTACKED by Brady the man who lives/works here.
I went in about a discrepancy with the charges posted to my account and was met with being physically attacked.
Legal actions are being taken to PERMANENTLY close this location.

STAY AWAY FROM THIS LOCATION!
Unless you enjoy being physically attacked by employees 4x your size.
