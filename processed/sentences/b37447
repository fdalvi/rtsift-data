Beautiful park with two baseball fields with one large and one small jungle gym.
They also have a mini concession stand for when baseball games are going on.
The only thing that sucks is all the writing on both jungle gyms.
Other than that this park is great, small, and quite.

Semi clean park with a couple of fields and a small play area.
Not the nicest park in vegas but this one is quiet.
