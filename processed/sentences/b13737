They employees that work at this store are always really nice.
The store on the other hand is a mess.
Im shock that the health department hasnt shut most of these Circle K's Down for being so dirt especially around their food.
Yuck!

Circle K what can I say?
It's fast, convenient and affordable.
No more needs to be said, anyway.

This is by far the dirtiest gas station I've ever been to.
The soft drink area is ALWAYS a total mess.
Cups and lids are never stocked and the counter top is always filthy.
In fact, the other day I went in there and there was not one Styrofoam cup available for use so me and another customer were looking in the drawers for some.
A couple days later, I went in and this time they had cups and lids.. but no straws!
I had to then use 2 of the little coffee straws.
Another recent instance I had was when I went in to get a few different candy bars and literally, almost every candy bar box was empty.
I then asked one of the employees if he had a specific bar in the back and whad'ya know... he did.
Just pure laziness!
RESTOCK IF YOUR MERCHANDISE IS EMPTY OR GETTING LOW AND AT LEAST CLEAN THE STORE FROM TIME TO TIME.
The only reason I didn't give this place a 1 star is because even though the employees are clearly lazy, the two gentlemen that are typically there during the day are very nice.
