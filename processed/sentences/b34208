I prefer Costa Coffee, so much richer than Starbucks and I like the fact that they do pay UK Tax as opposed to the dodgy Starbucks!
But alas, I do not like any of their Cakes, they have stopped doing everything I like, so its a tin of ground Coffee to take home and probably Starbucks next time...

Handy space on Musselburgh High Street.
I'll admit - anything that isn't a charity shop that appears these days I see as a blessing.
I'm not really bothered by 'chain stores are destroying high streets!
' - online shopping is.
I tell you what - every shop that tries to come in and invigorate our lonesome small town streets is a joy and a blessing.
Costa does what it says on the tin - it has a great location in the middle of the high street, and a pleasant place to stop for a quick drink or a chat with friends.
There are other options of course, but I'm all about options, and am glad Costa has been added to the list.

Like Catriona C says it's a handy spot on Mussleburgh High street and it's a happy welcome too.
Hoping that it builds up a coffee scene in Mussleburgh as it needs less bargain stores and more good shops.
The staff are very cheery which makes a difference in chain.
often you find staff unhappy and fed up.
we had panini's and I tried the new hot apple spice drink which lovely warm and very sweet!
Perhaps next time I will ask for less of the syrup base.
Mum had coffee, which went fast as always!
Plenty of seating outside and in.
The main Toilets are upstairs and there are a few steps!
one of the nicer costas!
