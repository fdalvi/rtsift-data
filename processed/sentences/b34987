Very pretty building located in old town chandler if thats what you call it.
So I happened to ask the nice lady behind the desk where can I get some coffee and she directs me way out of my way... so this building is full of office workers that work for the city and there are other city offices in the vicinity, and you are telling me that ther is no coffee anywhere in walking distance????
Whats up with that???

Its is a pretty building near lots of places to eat.
However no one who works at city hall doesn't have a recommendation for anything!
Lame!
I was hoping for a spectacular place to eat at while in this neck of the woods.....disappointed.
Oh well, on my own I shall venture

I'm going to tell you a secret so listen closely!
If you are in need of a Passport City of Chandler is the place to go!
They offer services Monday to Friday 8 am to 4pm no appointment necessary, can you believe that?
Did you schedule an appointment weeks in advance with the local post office??
I almost did!
I was in need of a passport and had my forms all filled out went down on a Friday morning, thought there was going to be a wait, but nope there was none, unfortunately I didn't have all my ducks in a row, so I had to go back home but found what I needed and headed back this time around noon.
Again no wait, got right in.
turned in my paper work and was out within 15 minutes!
The staff was extremely helpful and friendly, so if you need a passport or renewal go head on down to City of Chandler!
Just a helpful tip, it makes things more smoothly, have your paper work filled out before you get there.
You can find your needed forms here: http://travel.state.gov/passport/forms/ds11/ds11_842.html
