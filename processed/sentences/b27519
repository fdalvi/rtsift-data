Very much just a small great place to eat.
Everything I've had here is great and I try new things all the time.
My wife loves the Pad Se Ew with extra chinese broccolli  and the vegetable rolls.
The Tom Kha Kai is the creamiest that you'll ever find, Red Curry, Spicy Beef Salad, Silver Noodle Salad, Rad Na, Papaya Salad, Thai Beef Jerky, Curry Fried Rice, Seafood and Fish Dishes, they are all awesome.
If you don't mind the humble surroundings and just want great Thai food be sure to try it out when you are on the East side.

The first time I went there they had the cutest little lady who knew my fiance well.
He has been dining there for lunch for years.
She was so welcoming.
She even gave us free won-tons and soup as we waited for our food.
The pad thai is DELISH!
My favorite is the spicy mint chicken.
Get ready to break a sweat but goodness it is worth it.
Their Thai tea is extremely good as well.
I have yet to not enjoy their food!
We feel like regulars when we do go.

A surpringly good, authentic Thai restaurant, despite the advertisement of Chinese, Thai Cuisine was a delight.
I had the yellow curry, pad see ewe, egg rolls, and Thai iced tea.
The Thai iced tea was sweet, but not too sweet.
The pad see ewe we had was with chicken, and the meat was plentiful.
The flavor was very good, and the Chinese broccoli was fresh and tasty.
Even the noodles were tasty, and no grease!
The yellow chicken curry surprised me the most.
It was styled just the way I like it, similar to the (old) Thai Grill: soupy, but flavorful.
I was quite delighted to find another Thai restaurant that makes curry this way instead of the usual Indian style.
The curry wasn't as flavorful as the (old) Thai Grill, but it was definitely good!
I recommend this Thai restaurant for the Thai dishes.
I haven't tried the Chinese dishes, and I don't plan to, but chances are that they are tasty as well.
I will be coming here often since it is close to my work!

I love Thai cuisine.
I always call in my order.
The food is always prompt and fresh.
The portions and price can't be beat.
They always give me extra eggrolls which are delicious.
The thai tea is good too.

Great food and great service!
The mint chili chicken is my favorite and definitely worth a try if you're looking to change it up from pad Thai.
The egg flower soup is amazing-it's something that's easy to mess up but they get it right every time!
The only thing I'm not impressed with is the egg rolls but those almost always come free with any take out order.

This is my second favorite Thai Restaurant in Las Vegas.
Everything on the menu is so good that you can close your eyes and point, and you cannot go wrong.
If you enjoy the traditional Thai dishes done right, then this is the place for you!
The staff is fun, friendly and so attentive.
I always look forward to coming back here!

Real Thai food, excellent.

I have been a fan of this restaurant for years, here are some of the reasons why: Food is delicious, fresh, and affordable.
They are always consistant.
They are friendly, attentive and always happy to go out of their way to make your have a great experience.
I love the red curry and it is always hard to stay away from the pad thai.
Thai ice tea is sweet and perfeclty mixed.
AUTHENTIC ?
just look at the kitchen and wave at grandma!
She is always there preparing fresh meals.

They have the best lunch specials around.
It is a modified buffet.
They have serve yourself Tom Yum soup, wontons and egg rolls.
You order an entree.
It is about $7.
All entrees come with fried or white rice.
I have tried everyone of the lunch specials.
BUt the curry is the best.
I get it spicy #5.
They make a sauce there that I have never had before.
It is hot, sour, salty goodness.
I have tried to find out what it is but there is a bit of a language barrier.
The service is outstanding.
Maybe it is because I go there all the time but they on the spot!

I finally sat down in here to have a meal instead of ordering take out or having it delivered.
I went on lunch time.
And it was a pretty good special.
You must get the egg rolls and soup yourself.
The Thai Iced tea was delicious.
The lunch portion of Ginger chicken was great and filling.
The Ginger wasnt over powering.
Kudos on the seasoning being spot on.

Entrees were very good, but the soup and egg roll were at least a day old.
I'm sure it's a great place when there are actual customers, but the lack of patronage seems to have made them a little lazy.

Solid joint.
I like the delivery service for the EASTCYDE.
They always throw in a couple of egg rolls.
FOR SHEEZIE!
Beef or chicken curry with rice always hits the spot.
Thai jerky isn't bad.
I can't complain about the chicken pad Thai.
Their seafood soup is awesome with rice after a day of snowboarding or when you're sick.
Friendly staff.
Sometimes a language barrier when on the phone.
I think they were training someone "fresh off the boat" na eye mean?
One of two good Thai joints on the EASTCYDE.
Thanks Thai Cuisine for the delivery service whenever I'm too lazy to leave.
HIGH LIKA CHU PEOPLES!!

This place has really delicious authentic Thai food.
My favorite from them is the Curry Fried Rice.
I haven't found any other restaurant that has made it that way.
What's also good is the Seafood sour soup.
It comes with a plentiful of shrimp, scallops, squid, and octopus.
Delicious in flavor and broth.
I don't quite like the Pad Thai though, to me it has kind of a sweet taste with just isn't accord with me.
I prefer the Pad Thai from Pin Kaow, which is separate when you get the Pad Thai you put the bean sprouts, peanuts, and dressing in it.
That's what I'm more used to when I had it in Viet Nam.

Ordered Tom Yum Goong soup.
Luckily the waitress asked my friend and I what level of heat we wanted.
We asked for medium and it was perfect.
Love that we could help ourselves to the egg rolls and chicken soup as well.
This was my second time there and I will be going back!
You can't beat the prices as well.

I very rarely try Thai food, probably because I feel like an 62 year old person who is afraid of change but at the same time can barely work an iPhone.
But I finally got around trying Thai, and I must say that this is a pretty solid establishment.
There is a nice open feel when you enter the restaurant, my girlfriend says this is really authentic Thai food so I guess I will have to say based on that, I love Thai!
I tried the chicken curry and some duck fried rice with yellow curry?
I'm still a Thai newb so pardon my ignorance.
Either way, it was definitely different and it was pretty adequately priced.
I want to give this place 5 stars, but I get gun shy when it comes to perfection.
I'll go to other Thai places down the road and might come back to this one to do an updated review.
I had no problem with the service, they gave us some free eggrolls as well.
Good stuff.
There was also a lady who fell over a table when she arrived in the store, looking back that probably was hysterical.
Sorry Yelpers, no real interesting stories here.
Just a solid establishment  #DontThaiMeBro #TheGoodLife #Level10CurryKickedMyAss

When it is a late night dinner, both my husband and I know there is only one place we will be ordering from.
Thai Cuisine has some of the most amazing Asian food,  my favorite is the pineapple rice, and the pot stickers.
My husband likes anything really hot, and their chicken wings.
You must try the place if you haven't already.
My mouth is watering just thinking about it.
Note*  Do not order lunch, it came cold, and without the soup they advertise.
The lunch combo's tasted like it came from  an all you can eat buffet !
LUNCH NEVER AGAIN RIP OFF AFTER THIS IT WILL BE AWHILE BEFORE I RETURN FOR DINNER!

Call me crazy but I had to leave the safety of my domicile to satisfy that "ethnic" pallet of mine.
Sixty mile a hour gusting winds and I took my family out to eat.
Yes, that it food dedication (or spoiled taste buds).
No harm came to me or my family in the making of this adventure.
We initially drove past this establishment trusting our hand dandy GPS to get us there the first time.
When we finally made the place out and fight our way through the winds we came into a nicely set up, friendly restaurant.
We seated ourselves.
We decided on the lunch special menu, which included a all you can eat soup and spring rolls.
Don't be fooled by the mere commonalty of spring rolls.
Their's were excellent.
So, crispy and full of cabbage and clear noodles.
There are two dipping sauces, the usual sweet/sour and then my favorite vinegar based w/hot peppers.
We ordered:  Red curry spice level 7 -- Hmn, not spicy...where da spice?
Yellow curry spice level 0 --  Kids said it was a little spicy.
Us grown ups thought otherwise.
Mint chicken spice level 5 -- Had a Chinese food flavor to it.
Not bad but not what I was craving.
Spice level was good though.
I don't like it so hot that I can't taste my food just hot enough to make me breathe through my mouth.
Pad Thai -- I'm not a big fan of Pad Thai and this was just way too sweet for me.
For curry, I'll keep going to Pan Asian.
For everything else I tried...I can' live without.
Maybe, their other menu items are the true flare to the place.
I'll just never know that.

Really really good !
Just moved to East Vegas, wanted a good restaurant !
Found one.
Had: Crab Cheese Rangoons (delish) Chicken Satay (fabulous) Chicken Yellow Curry (perfect taste & after taste) Spicy Mint pork with lots of veggies, spice level 4 (sooo good)  I will definitely return !
This was a great experience & the staff was superb.
Plus they comped us wonton rolls that were sooo good.

Wow, yes, a place that delivers to my house that is NOT pizza.
Ordered Chicken Curry (yellow, medium) and a Thai Salad (pretty basic), and I got the complimentary egg rolls with the delivery order.
Curry was all right.
Not the best I have had, but maybe they do it better in the store?
I can't imagine it would be all that different though because it seems as though the moment I put in my order it magically appeared at my door.
Yes, that fast I tell you!
By the way, delivery charge was... FREE!
Yes, I ordered off of Eat24 and this was the only place around me that was not charging a delivery fee.
My Thai Salad was good, lots of tomatoes and cucumbers.
Very fresh and of course a nice compliment to the curry.
I like to eat the salad and curry at the same time.
It just seems to cleanse the palette so you don't have spicy, spicy coming at you the entire time.
The egg rolls were quite yummy.
I like to dip them in the spicy chili sauce - I wish they'd given me more instead of bringing a cup of the sweeter sauce.
Overall I loooooved my food, right in the comfort of my own living room.

I am a fan of thai food...
Being asian i have an affinity for food from the far east...
I had the pad thai here...
I ordered it at a 7 in terms on spicyness...
I have to say it was a little too strong for my tastes,, kinda killed the other flavors of the dish...
The lady that took the order was very nice...
I just ordered the pad thai,, and she threw in an order of Spring Rolls which were tasty.. Not like my mom's or aunt but it was good...
I would recommend the pad thai from here....
I will eat here again for sure... Good solid food, good portions, served with a smile,,, what more could you ask for...
Thank you

Really really good !
Just moved to East Vegas, wanted a good restaurant !

they are awsome

Read the review on yelp before I decided to pop in.
I mean, what kind of name is this restaurant.
Thai cuisine???
Straight up thai food, nothing extra like Yai or Jasmine or Lotus.
Straight up, thai cuisine.
Well, their food was bomb.
Pop in for a nice little lunch snack with my lady and this place is pretty decent for the area.
If you think you have to go all the way to chinatown to get a decent thai food.
Think again!
This place pretty bomb diggity when it comes to thai food.
Love their pad thai and their free egg rolls.
Did you know that you can get extra soup too if you want.
You just have to get it yourself buffet style.

This was some of the tastiest Thai food I've had in LV.
The chicken coconut soup was really great and served in a bowl with a small active volcano in the middle to keep it hot.
They brought us a double order of egg rolls-we only ordered one.
My wife had yellow curry that was great, my one complaint being that the curry broth was a little too white and had just a hint of "curry" flavor.
Also there wasn't quite enough of the broth that I am used to with other places.
It was more thick like a sauce.
These are minor complaints about the dish as overall it was quite good.
We will definitely go back!
Ignore what your GPS says-it is on the Northwest corner of Pecos and Nellis.
My GPS is nearly 10 years old though.....

To start off, the best things about this place is the cleanliness and friendliness of the staff, and the incredibly affordable lunch special.
However, the food is nothing spectacular.

I've been meaning to try this place for a long time, but finally got around to doing so today with my son.
I was surprised that they offered their lunch specials on a weekend, as many places do not.
So, that was a plus.
We were greeted as soon as we walked in by a very friendly waitress.
She asked if we had ever been there before, and when we said "no" she gave us a short summary of the menu.
That was nice.
The lunch specials included choice of white or fried rice, soup, and eggroll.
I ordered the red curry chicken.... spicy level 5 (medium).
The food arrived quickly and was nicely presented.
We were a little surprised that the portions were rather small, though.
But most importantly it was delicious!
It was enough to fill us up, but other Thai/Chinese restaurants have given us more.
It's not a fancy place, but prices are reasonable, service was great, and the food tasted yummy.
We'll be back.

This place is legit.
I had no idea it was around, until I consulted yelp during a recent, month-long asian dining binge.
So far, I've tried the duck curry(YUM!!!
) and red curry w/ chicken.
The duck curry wasn't overcooked, which is often the case at other places, and had just enough fat(lots but not tons, lol).
Mangoes weren't in season when I visited in January :-(  The menu looks very exciting.
I'll be back :-)

Thai Cuisine is still my go to take-out place!
I've only dined in a couple of times, but the experiences were great.
Service is quick and friendly and the atmosphere is cozy.
They have some really great lunch specials that include a trip to the soup/egg roll bar.
I mostly order out, most time opting for delivery ($15 minimum order).
There is a bit of a language barrier, but they always repeat your order back just to double check.
My usuals are the pad thai with chicken, chili mint chicken, garlic pepper eggplant and spicy seafood soup.
The chili mint chicken is basically ground chicken with thai chiles that can be served over rice or even better in a lettuce cup (though they don't come with those).
It's even better leftover!
I really like the spicy seafood soup, a mix of shrimp, fish, mussels and veggies in a spicy, flavorful broth.
It's one of my favorite things to order in the winter-so comforting!
I've always received free egg rolls with each order-they're not the best egg rolls, but I'm not going to hate on free.
Delivery time can be crazy long on the weekends, so sometimes it's just better to come in and pickup.
The staff is always friendly and your order is ready when they say it will be ready-I've never had to wait.
I wouldn't drive out of my way for Thai Cuisine, but this isn't a neighborhood that has many neighborhood restaurants (mostly chain or fast food).
Thai Cuisine is a bit of a gem in a relative food desert and I like that!

I ate at the Thai cuisine resturant on 2-26-2013.
It sets on the NW corner of Nellis and Bonanza.
I  arrived during lunch and there were several people eating but there was ample seating to chose from.
The place was clean and the service was prompt.
I was brought a menu immediately and ordered a lunch special (Garlic Chicken) with a spicy level of 7.
I noticed a buffet type food cart and asked what it was and without answering she motioned for me to the cart.
There were spring rolls and soup that you could help yourself to.
(I took 2 spring rolls and a bowl of what looked like soup with chicken and Thai vegtables) Both were good, the soup a little mild, but good.
I noticed that a customer had returned to the cart and took 4 or 5 spring rolls and  Not knowing if it was allowed, I returned and got 2 more spring rolls when my order arrived.
I don't have any experience with Thai food and would not know how to compare this resturant to others but the food I ordered was good and although I ordered it to be a 7 on the spicy scale, I could have ordered an 8 or possibly a 9.
I would not drive a long distance to eat at this resturant, but if I was in the area, I'd eat there again.

Get the Panang Curry Chicken, it'll change your life!
Place is very clean, the service is very good and the food is exceptional.

Living in Sunrise it is hard to find good food when the vast majority of your options are under Golden Arches or have a greasy value menu.
I like this restaurant because it is well cooked Thai food served in an environment you actually want to sit in.
As opposed to some other restaurants in the area which may have good food but I'd rather take it to go and not linger a moment longer than necessary for a pick up.
I love that they give you complimentary egg rolls with your meal in an age where nothing is free.
The curries here are bomb.
I have brought a couple of friends with me and this is generally the go to when we want curry.
The chili mint fried rice with any meat is just a delicious flavor to experience.
Their crab fried rice was a complete and utter miss for me.
It was the one time I wish the portion was smaller because I did not want to finish it.
This place is just a welcome spot in the food dessert that is Sunrise Mountain and it is greatly appreciated.

The staff is friendly & the food is very good.
I have dined in & ordered delivery.

As good as it gets.
They know how to make it spicy AND flavorfull!

Just want to say "Yum!
Yum!
", & So Far -- So good!

Stopped by last night after a long work week.
My husband and I have been coming here for over 4 years, while enjoying our coconut chicken soup which was , as always, spiced just right and nice and hot, I was trying to recall, how and when did I discover this palate-pleasing place.
I finally figured I have been coming here for over 10 years, my family has eaten here with me, my friends and now my husband, the secret to this place: Food is always better than the last time.
It never disappoints and for the price, really?
I have grown close to some of the people that work there, and they make it a point to always say hello and come out and greet us.The panang is by far really hard to beat, the mint pork.....finger-licking-good, and of course I can not eat here without the chicken pad thai.....I could go on for days.
The music, the people and of course the quality of the food, all make it a favorite for us.

Love this good when I was pregnant with my daughter I ate almost every day .
They are always friendly and have offers and coupons they always offer me and my family

Me and a friend came across this place on yelp and decided to check it out.
Upon entering your greeted by such friendly people.
The service was prompt and very attentive.
We ordered Penang curry and orange chicken.
It was delicious!
We were very surprised being that it is on a not so fancied side of town.
This place is a must try if you are in the area!
We are definitely fans and will become regulars.
Later in the week I ordered delivery and on the phone the lady was so sweet!
The people that run this restaurant are just the most warm people ever.
Oh!
And the the free egg rolls are a plus too!

Average Thai food.
Not the best but not the worst.
If you want Thai food it is worth considering this place!

The service was excellent,  and the food was brought out quickly.
We ordered fried rice, pad see eaw, dumplings,  and ragoons.
The ragoons were cooked to perfection but the filling was 95% crab\5% cream cheese,  and the pad see eaw was a little bland.
The fried rice and dumplings were excellent.
Portions were a great size as well.

This place is great!
I got lost trying to find it but so glad I didn't give up.
Their Pad Thai is a bit more expensive than what I'm used to, but totally worth it.
The staff is so friendly and best of all...they deliver!

Food it's delicious service it's awesome I have try many items in their Menu but my favorites are papaya salad on a #4 which it's not to spicy  and yellow shrimp curry #6 perfect combination and to drink THAI tea ASK for PAM she it's a great server ;)

I have been ordering from this restaurant for well over 10 years, and the food is very good!
The people who work there are very nice and always try to make sure you are satisfied.
I would highly recommend them, but if you order online, don't use Eat24, just call the restaurant yourself and order on the phone.

Food was great!
Taste was on point .
Delivery was maybe 10 min late but no big deal.
I was still amazed that they had delivery as an option in the east side of town.
Definitely ordering in again.
You guys made my lazy Sunday :)   Crab rangoons were soooo good.
Medium spicy has a nice kick to it I wonder what hot is like.
Every order was good size sharable portions.

Very impressed!
We ordered crab Rangoons which where plump and full of filling.
Lots of crab , a little more cream cheese would have made them the best ever!!
Chicken satay was also great!!!
We also ordered the pad Thai which was decent although it lacked flavor.
I will def order from here again though!

Very mediocre food.
Yes its thai - barely

Living on the East side of Las Vegas, we are limited on good places to eat.
Thai Cuisine is a place I've been going to for years.
Thai food is probably one of my favorite type of foods to eat, so I've tried many places in the valley.
This place rates right in the middle.
The food is good enough to crave but not great enough to be my number one choice.
Of course if I don't want to drive far and I have a craving, I don't really have much of a choice.
The Thai Beef salad here is delicious.
Just the perfect amount of lettuce and spices.
I always cry about how Thai places do not like to put a lot of veggies in their Thai Beef Salad.
They think a lot of beef is what people want.
But not everyone.
I love my veggies!
Last visit we had ordered Spicy Seafood Soup.
One of my favorites dishes to order.
It comes out in a bowl on fire.
Soup is sour with a great kick to it.
Large variety of seafood inside, We also ordered Chicken Pad Thai, first time ordering it here.
It was ok. Noodles were cooked well but there was a lack of flavor.
It was more on the sweeter side.
Service is great.
they bring out complimentary egg rolls which is appreciated.
They don't accept debit/credit cards for some reason.
But, they do have a ATM inside the restaurant.
So be prepared to have cash if you decide to dine here.
