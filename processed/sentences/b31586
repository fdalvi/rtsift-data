Timely and courteous, plus did a great job on my car.
I would recommend him to a friend.

Kevin always does a fantastic job on my vehicles.
Been doing business with him for 20 yrs and will continue to.
Will highly recommend to everyone who needs windows tinted.

Just bought a new car and needed to get it tinted asap because a car is never complete without tint!
Never had my car tinted in AZ so had to turn to my savior Yelp and found Kevin.
He quoted me over the phone and got me in quick :) the best is he travels to you so you can relax at home while you car is being taken cared of!

Had to have Kevin to come back and redo my tint because their were still bubbles and an area in the tint where a hair was.
J called him and he came out to redo the windows i had issues with.
Fingers crossed that it comes out better this time!
