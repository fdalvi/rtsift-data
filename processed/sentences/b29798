Just tried Orange Leaf tonight, I really liked the colors used in the decor so bright and sunny!
They have some very unique flavors and a good assortment of toppings.
This is a self serve location where you can  have it in a cup or also make your own smoothies all for only .39 an once so you can make it as affordable as you like.
Fro-yo rocks !!!

I think this is going to be my favorite fro-yo place.
I liked the decor and the large selection of flavors, they not only had PISTACHIO, but also Banana, my two favorite.
Also, the texture seemed to be creamier than others.
I liked that the seating is low and round, so I can bring the twins without too much worry about sharp corners.

I have been to lots of yogurt shops all around the Valley, and I think Orange Leaf is my favorite.
It used to be Yogurt Builderz, but there are too many kids that run around that place.
Orange Leaf has great yogurt and a nice selection of toppings.
It is not too overwhelming.
The yogurt is nice and creamy.
I highly recommend.

Nice place and the yogurt was yummy.
I like that they had these big bottles of carmel and stuff next to the check-out...
I added a little carmel before check-out.
