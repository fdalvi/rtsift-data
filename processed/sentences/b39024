Used to be run by AllState Storage, and they ran the business very well.
New owners, changed the name to Black Canyon Bargain Storage...TERRIBLE!
Do not rent their units.
They doubled the rates to all customers, they do not know how to run a business or what the term "customer service" means.
If I could give this business a negative star, I would.

Excellent customer service -- very friendly and warm!
I called from out-of-state to reserve a storage unit for a friend in Phoenix and they helped me pick the right size unit and took care of all my questions.

Recently rented a large unit and found the manager (Lacey) to be EXTREMELY professional and helpful.
She responded promptly to my emails, and was quite pleasant in person.
The process of signing the lease was seamless and took all of 10 minutes.
I feel safe visiting my unit, with cameras and lighting everywhere.
I will keep renting here... it's convenient to me on Bell Rd and I17, and easy to get to from the highway.
Very pleased with my experience and  highly recommend to others.
