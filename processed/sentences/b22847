I've been coming here for years and until last night, forgot the name!
Reasonable prices for ice cream- probably one of the hidden gems of the city- why else is my review the second?
Dreyer's ice cream- 16 flavors like Kona coffee, Rocky Road, Coconut & Pineapple, Butter Pecan, Bubble Gum, and seasonal ones too- like Peppermint and Pumpkin.
Your choice of cone- sugar, cake, or waffle.
Single scoop cones are $2.79 but if you want the waffle cone, it's $2.99.
Also available are sundaes, shakes, and banana splits.
You can also buy popcorn here.
Seven tables with chairs- five of them close to the small ice cream shop- two of them against the wall where it states "Thank You for not smoking.
" There is no wall of separation- more like a small railing for the main seating area.
Foot traffic includes people passing by through the entrance/exit doors- for the casino or most likely the movie theatre.
When we got here last night, we were the only ones, and then the single employee got two more sets of customers.
It's funny how people always look at you when you're eating ice cream (it's like free advertising for the ice cream shop).
I got the kona in a cake cone and my husband got the coconut and pineapple in a sugar cone- both were really good.
Dreyer's ice cream is pretty good.
Check this place out if you're in the casino.

Went here based on other Yelp reviews and wasn't disappointed!
I had a chocolate shake and it was delicious.
Also sampled the kids' root beer float and soft-serve, and both were yummy.
The only downfall is the place is tucked in the back of the Sam's Town casino.

Got to Sam's Town and was craving a shake.
Immediately thought of this place and even better I got a malt!
Mmm, I chose Kona coffee ice cream.
Very good!
It's tucked away in the corner near the movie theater.
Not busy at all when I was there.
