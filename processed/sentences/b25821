Dr. Rehl is a very considerate individual.
He takes his time with you which doesn't happen these days in the practice of Medicine.
He listens well and will ask the question he needs to to give you his best expertise.
Proof positive of this is the way he works with my friend who is in her fifth year of Alzheimers.
She has major allergies and I think he has done better in this area than any physician I've taken her to even before she started suffering from dementia..  His staff stays on top of things as well.
You don't see new people everytime you go in.
His people wstay with him.
No problem parking is a positive as well.
It's relatively easy to get in and get out.

Dr Rehl is plain awesome in my book.
He takes plenty of time to listen and explain everything to you in plain English.
After 4 surgery's my last ENT sent me to him.
After a 5 hour surgery I feel great.
My life is so much better because of this mans patience and caring nature.
I would recommend him to anybody with sinus problems....It's been 6 months since my surgery and feeling great
