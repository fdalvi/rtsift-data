Unbelievably slow service when when there isn't a line of people waiting.
I have been there twice and both times ordered a muffin and both times walked away without my muffin because the employees are quick to ring up the purchase but often slow to remember to give it to the customer.
Very disappointed in the service

I was cut off in line with two employees watching.
I looked at them and thought they'd correct the situation, but they took the other person's order.
Told a manager and didn't feel that the employees were talked to.
Prices also seem much higher due to location.
Taking my business else where.
Green tea fraps aren't worth poor customer service.
