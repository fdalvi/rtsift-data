Vue Bar is pretty much a generic Vegas casino bar, except for the cheap beer and excellent people-watching.
But on a street dedicated to people-watching, Vue Bar is the best place to "view" (rim shot) Fremont Street.
Maybe its just a sign of how over-priced Vegas is, but a balcony bar serving $1 drafts where you can watch the Fremont Street Experience seems like a prize.

If you get lucky to snag on of the 4 or 5 tables out on the balcony overlooking Freemont Street you have scored.
$3.25 for a cocktail.
Great place to rest your weary feet for awhile.

This is a simple bar located upstairs in the Fitz downtown.
It is a great place to catch the Fremont Light Show because of the balcony that is located outside.
Also the bar has 1 drafts and domestics.
If we go downtown, we stop by here and say hello.
The staff is friendly and always is fast.
It may not be a fancy place, but the customer service is solid here, which is more important to me than a fancy bar.

Friendly bartenders that joke around and make conversation with you while making your order.
Drinks are reasonably priced as with most places on the Fremont St Exprerience.
Good place to stop for drinks after coming up the escalator and entering the D, which is what we did when we stopped by here.
