When you say the word "DEAL" the first thing to come to mind is Subway.
Sing it with me!
FIVE...FIVE DOLLAR...FIVE DOLLAR FOOT LOOOOONG!
Yes, I am singing.
My choice is the Oven Roasted Chicken Foot Long on Nine Grain Wheat Bread.
Make it toasted, with provolone cheese, onion, bell pepper, lettuce, tomato and sweet onion sauce.
The restaurant is nice and clean and the people behind the counter are extremely friendly.
Where to go to lunch today?
I definitely would agree to Subway any day of the week.

I have lunch about 2 or 3 times a week at this Subway.
What I am most impressed with is how clean the store is and that they have low staff turnover.
In the last 2 years I have only seen 4 employees here, and they remember what I like.
When I come into the store they immediately greet me and start making my sandwich.
This is extremely important if I am on the phone and can't take a break to order.
Of all the Subway stores in Las Vegas, this one is my favorite, so 5 stars!

Came here for lunch during the work week.
The Girl that was making my sandwich behind the counter was nice and pretty speedy.
I ordered a salad and asked for all spinach.
I like the way they mix the salad and break it up into small pieces.
The lady that was making my salad was generous with the toppings as well and I appreciate it when I don't have to ask for more.
The salad was really yummy and I was surprised at how much I liked it b/c the last time I had a salad from Subway was years ago and it wasn't nearly as tasty.
That could very well have been my fault, but irregardless, I'll be back for a healthy lunch on the go.
I do wish they had some patio seating here, but Panda Express is 2 doors down and they have a large outside eating area out front if you care to venture outdoors.

Horrible service!!!!
same Mexican guy always working.. never says hello or goodbye just asks what you want in broken English.
sooooooooo annoying!
