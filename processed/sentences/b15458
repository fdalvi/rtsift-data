It is fast and easy

Probably the worse subway I have eaten at.
The bread on 3 sandwiches we ordered was stale and falling apart.
Service was slow and the restroom was scary.
I was very disappointed with this visit.
Subway is eaten often, not sure I'll ever come back to this one.

Really skimpy on to toppings.
Rude customer service.
Check out person was on the phone during the entire transaction.
I avoid this subway.
