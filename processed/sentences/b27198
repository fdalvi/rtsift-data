Owner is rude and manager Amanda does not return calls.
They owe me $500 for an item I did not pick and they are refusing to issue credit to my credit card or another order I already paid for.
Prices are also absurd and they act like you are a bad person if you ask for a discount when buying thousands of dollars worth of clothes!
Go to Nordstrom Rack, far superior service and prices that are 50 - 80% less than Gregory's!

Gregory's is a woman's heaven on earth.
If you are a woman's woman and love sexy, sensual, beautiful shoes that fit like a slipper, you MUST visit this store!!
The staff is fantastic.
The girls are able to read your style without you saying a word.
Never in my life have I had a complete stranger offer me a shoe that I immediately fell in love with, and was sold without a second guess.
This is my new favorite shoe store, and I don't ever want to purchase shoes anywhere else!
