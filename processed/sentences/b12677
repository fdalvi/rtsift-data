Great service, great prices, nice art nouveau inspired surroundings, the fried chicken platter was tender on the inside, crispy on the outside, the prime rib special was tasty, moist, the french fries fresh and crunchy.
Wonderful selection of herbal teas, and champagne.

Stopped in here because I had meal comp from the casino.
Menu ranges from breakfast items, to sandwiches, and some random entrees.
No real theme here, just different stuff.
Fish tacos to steak, to country fried steak, to fish and chips, grilled chicken, etc.
I don't think it would be hard to find something for everyone in your group here.
Ordered french onion soup, which was tasty and cheesy, along with the prime rib sandwich and au jus.. or however you spell it.
The sandwich was massive, stuffed with so much yummy prime rib you can barely get your mouth around it.. Well, unless you happen to be Steven Tyler.
French fries were only ok, a was the fried fish my boyfriend got.
Pretty decent prices on draft bear.. but a glass of mountain dew was almost the same price as the beer??
What the hell?
I'd probably eat here again, it's better than the buffet, and will run you around the same.
Waitress needs to check her attitude at the door though, if she ever wants to get tips.

Stopped here for breakfast this morning after work before heading home to Socal while I stayed at the Santa Fe.
The restaurant was fairly empty which I appreciated.
I was greeted right away by a friendly waitress who promptly brought my drink.
I ordered the huevos rancheros with scrambled egg whites, which were no extra charge.
They huevos rancheros were a generous portion with crispy tortillas, egg whites, beans, cheese, ranchero sauce, guacamole, sour cream, and a beautifully roasted whole jalapeno.
I did think the the service of the food itself was a little slow for the emptiness of the restaurant, but maybe I was just hungry.
The prices were really reasonable.
$10 for the whole breakfast and drink.
They have a really nice counter by the cash register with many delicious looking bakery treats, which I unfortunately didn't try.
I would come back.

Over the years, this coffee shop has been all over the place.
I once vowed I'd never return.
Now that it's no longer Coco's, we stayed for dinner.
I had the chicken Cobb salad and my wife had a turkey sandwich on sourdough.
Both meals were very good and we had very good service.
They've gone up in my estimation and we'll probably return.
It was nice to go somewhere different.

FOOD UNEADABLE!
Where do I even begin.
The food was beyond horrible.
I'm not the type to complain at restaurants but the food was the worst I've ever eaten in my life.
I ate about half before I almost vomitted.
I will NEVER eat in this dump again.
To top it off the cashier screws up my sale, has to call a manger to fix it, takes the guy 20 mins to get there and he doesn't know how to operate the cash register.
I just threw up my hands and walked out.
Absolutely terrible.
No clue how to run a restaurant.

Grand Cafe is back!
Decently priced food with really large portions allows you to have a 2nd meal the next day.
Dinner and lunch items are good like the sandwiches, salads, steaks, and the currently, the prime rib special for $9.99 from 4pm to 11pm.
Prime rib is a 12 oz cut, very tender with choice baked potato, and steamed vegetables.
Prime rib and potato is good, but the vegetables were oversteamed.
The breakfast skillets are a little too greasy for my taste.
Omelettes are good and very large.
Service is kind of slow, but if you are a party of 1, just ask to be seated at the bar area so you don't have to wait for a table.
Service is faster at the bar.

Service was terrible, glasses dirty,and silverware had waterspots.whe went for breakfast and told ourselves that you cannot ruin breakfast,we were wrong.
The eggs were left under the lamps too long so they came out dry.
Save your money go to McDonald's.

I love Graveyard specials.
Ever since I was a little kid I loved the $2.99 prime rib or steak n eggs specials that places like Stardust, San Remo, and Frontier used to have.
It's a shame that none of those places are still around.
The last of the great Graveyard specials was at The Orleans.
They had $1.99 biscuits and gravy and $3.99 steak and eggs.
Unfortunately, they got rid of that one too.
The graveyard specials had gone the way of the dodo, and it didn't seem like we would ever see them ever again.
Suddenly there was change.
And not that fakeass "hope" style change that Obama lied to us about.
This was REAL change!
All the station casinos decided to bring back the Graveyard Special at their 24 hour Grand Cafes.
Now, I gotta hand it to management at corporate Station Casino.
Who knew that  those lazy-bankrupt corporate d-bags who sit and do nothing in their cubicles behind Red Rock Station would finally get something right!
Congrats to all of you..you finally proved your grandmother wrong when she said that you wouldn't amount to anything.
In all seriousness, thanks a lot for bringing back the Graveyard special.
I very much appreciate it.
Also, I am very appreciative towards Station for allowing the Grand Cafe to actually be open 24 hours.
Many of the 24 hour coffee shops around Vegas now close around midnight due to corporate trying to save money on labor and sh!t.
Even the ones on the strip close down, which is idiotic because most people don't stop gaming till around 3 or 4 in the morning and are usually starving.
So thanks again for being open!
Unfortunately, not all Grand Cafe's are created equal.
Even though the menu is the same, some places have bad service or bad tasting food.
This location on the other hand has very good servers.
The one thing I can't stand about people here in Las Vegas is how they all act so disorientated and confused all the time.
I've gone to restaurants even at the Wynn and Venetian, where the server would come up to me and say something incoherent which no one at the table could understand.
You won't get this problem at the Santa Fe Station Grand Cafe.
The servers all speak clearly and have good work ethics.
Problem here is that the food is very mediocre compared to the Grand Cafe at the Red Rock.
And even the condiments are different.
At the Redrock they bring you those fancy individually bottled glass containers for your jam, ketchup etc.
At the Santa Fe, they just bring you your condiment in those small paper cup things.
The sourdough which came with my Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs special($4.99) was almost half an inch thick at the Red Rock's Grand Cafe, but at Santa Fe it was as thick as a saltine cracker.
In the end, the comp machine went down and I wasn't able to pay for the food with my points.
Also, it took 15 minutes to just pay for my food at the counter and I had to use real money, not that fake money stuff that I earned at the casinos for playing so many long hours.
What shocked me the most is that the lady at the cashier did something that I have never seen anyone do at a restaurant in a casino...she said: "Sorry for the inconvenience".
Holy Crap!
No casino worker has ever apologized to me ever.
So in conclusion, Santa Fe is a technically outdated.
It's a ghost town.
And they got a Johnny Rebel concert going on at some weird place called Revolver.
It sure ain't fancy like the Red Rock, but the service is a bit better.

Yay the old Grand cafe is back!!!
I went there this last Saturday for lunch I had a chicken buffalo salad ....sooo good!
the service was excelllent...and I even got some donuts on the way out!!!
Oh the donuts are soo good they are like the old Carls Dounuts!
YUM...I will definety be back!

Holy heck!
This place was beyond bad.
One star is too much.
We were heading out of town for the afternoon and decided to stop off at Santa Fe Station for brunch.
Our intention was to hit the buffet but the line was too long.
The Grand Cafe was right there and didn't look too busy so we decided to just eat there.
Now it is Saturday so the place wasn't empty but it wasn't terribly crowded as far as Saturdays go.
We walked right up to the hostess, told her there were five of us.
She said to wait while she found a table.
I could see plenty of empty tables but whatever.
While we were waiting, the manager came out and asked, "How many?
" I responded, "Someone is already helping us.
She went to find a table.
" The manager then very rudely snapped at me, "How many?
" I told him five and then he turned away from me and started talking to another hostess.
Meanwhile our hostess came back and led us to a table.
Our server showed up right away to take our drink orders and then she disappeared.
It took a very, very long time to get our drinks.
While I'm on the drinks...the kids' menu showcased two drinks.
They were very large photographs.
There were no other drinks mentioned anywhere on the kids menu.
When we placed our drink order my two youngest each ordered one of those drinks.
We were told they are not part of the kids meal and we'd be charged extra.
The drinks also showed up in regular glasses instead of the kids cups with lids.
I found this very weird and misleading.
Why showcase both drinks on the kids menu if they are not kids drinks??
My orange juice tasted really sour as if it were old.
We placed our order and waited, and waited and waited.
A server for a nearby table saw my look of death and came over to assure me our order was being put on a tray right then.
She'd just seen it was up and ready.
Yeah, right.
We continued to wait and wait and wait.
Finally, our server showed up and apologized saying that the corporate chef was there.
I have no idea what that means or why that means service is so slow.
I was just happy to have our food.
We had plans out of town and our tickets required us to be there at a specific time.
We were now running late.
Ok, so the food...bleh!!
It was sooo bad!
My oldest son ordered the french toast.
It was so soggy it was dough.
My youngest ordered pancakes that were not cooked through.
My husband had the same issue.
My hashbrowns were the most disgusting I'd ever had...ever.
They were bland mush.
I specifically ordered an omelet without mushrooms.
It had mushrooms.
I had ordered a side of fruit.
It came with tastless melon and one strawberry that had been quartered to give the illusion that i got more than one.
Nice try.
My husband ordered a side of bacon and it never came.
We spent maybe five minutes with our food before giving up and deciding just to leave.
This was truly a terrible experience and possibly the worst we've had in our four years in Las Vegas.
We will not go back.

They actually seat you pretty quick here compared to the Abortion Clinic(aka-Red Rock's Grand Cafe).
One particular host who has been diagnosed with ADHD will lose her train of thought and wander off somewhere before you even get to your seat.
So, at that particular moment you probably should just make a judgement call and sit at one of the open seats.
DO NOT sit on an empty chair at a table where there is already people sitting at(90% of Northwest Las Vegas locals seem to do that).
After sitting for a while, you will notice that you got no menu.
Patiently you will sit for about 10 minutes before you come to the conclusion that the host never informed the server that  a new customer has arrived.
As you look around at the facial expressions of the servers who are walking around the floor, you will see a look of  anxiety, concern, and frustration.
After around 15 minutes, you probably will attempt to get the attention of a server who is running by.
The servers will ignore you.
At around 16 minutes, you will physically flag down a server.
You will ask him/her, if you can at least get a menu.
He/She will tell you: "I em nut ur sirver".
At around 17 minutes, due to the rude replies of the staff, my patience has now been sodomized.
People like me in particular will began to talk sh!t and start abusing the staff.
Finally, the host then usually tells me that she will find my server.
I will witness the host run up to the person who was supposed to be my server, and tell her that I am pissed.
At this moment, my server will run into the kitchen and not come out.
As I wait for my server to come out of the kitchen, I witness every other customer yelling at their own servers.
The servers will ALWAYS reply by saying: "I EM JUS SO BEESY!
"(english translation: "I am just so busy").
They always use this particular "I am busy" excuse when they are giving poor service.
Even when there is only like 3 people in this restaurant, they will still claim that the slow service is due to them being "too busy".
The Northwest Vegas locals will usually reply to the server by saying: "TUF SHIT FAKR!
GO GIT MEH FUD!
I AM HUNGER!
" Usually after that, the servers will never come back.
At around 20 minutes, the restaurant manager will come out to address my concerns.
He himself will take my order, and make sure that my food comes out within 5 minutes due to how bad my experience had been.
One time when I asked him why my server ran away, he said because she was afraid that I would yell at her so she hid in the kitchen.
My advice to you all is not to actually yell at your server because it scares them and they actually run to the parking lot for safety.
As I sit and try to eat my steak and eggs, some random drunk girl from Revolver may try to sit at my table and start a conversation with me(this happens like 30% of the times I come here).
I don't know why, but I get hit on everywhere I go.
People tell me it's because I treat women like sh!t, so apparently it makes them want me even more(weird logic).
But, that's not true.
I absolutely do not hate women, I am just very uninterested in dating at this particular time in my life.
My job is very demanding and just plain f*cked up.
Like the other night I had to try to figure out a sugar-coated way to explain to a 7-year old why her mother committed suicide and won't be coming back.
So, usually after my shifts I have no desire to have fun, laugh, or even make friends.
But honestly, I tried my best to be nice to that drunk chick last Friday because about 3 hours before I came here I coincidentally ran into Misty Y's husband, who told me that I needed to be "more positive" and stop talking so much sh!t on people(both in real life and on yelp).
He was concerned because I get a lot of death threats from Business Owners, Human Resource Directors, and random yelpers due to my profane and abusive personality.
So, Misty's husband(forgot his name..think it was Bobby) gave me some advise to be more "nice" in hopes that it may lower the amount of mail bombs delivered to my house.
So, instead of telling that drunk chick to "F*ck off!
" like I usually do, I just lied to her and said I was gay.
It was a positive way to solve that situation.
I know Bobby would be proud of me.
Hes a good guy.
In conclusion, all these things that I mentioned above has happened to me almost every time I have come here during graveyard hours.
But, in all fairness, there are some days when I get 5-star service and food.
There are two workers here in particular who are actually really good at their job, and give excellent customer service.
One is a server named Robert, and I don't know the other worker's name but she is an extremely pretty African-American woman in her mid 20s.
If those two are working, you get a perfect experience.
If they are not working, you should probably avoid this place for the night.

I can't believe how many changes have occurred here.
The staff seems completely different now.
And the service is excellent.
I only come to GRAND CAFE locations for the Graveyard Specials.
The $5.99 Steaks N Eggs is all I need.
This Santa Fe location cooks their steak better than the other locations.
I eat my steak Blue-Rare, and this is one of the only places in the world where they get that right.
For those who don't know, Blue-Rare is almost purely raw with very slight searing on the outside.
It's very difficult to master this technique but the cooks here have done it!
The service here is completely 5-stars now.
I have no complaints about anything.
I am just sitting here in disbelief that the manager somehow found a way to turn my previous bad review into a Perfect 5-Star review.

I know that when it comes to Vegas things get torn down for new stuff all of the time.
The Santa Fe has had a change in owners over time and a change inside as well.
I miss the good ole days before Stations took it over.
The Grand Cafe just isn't what it should be.
None of them are consistent at any of the Stations which always baffles my mind.
We stopped in after midnight to play some nickel slots and decided to go to the Cafe for some of the specials they have after a certain hour.
I decided to get the "Breakfast Skillet".
It was good but I asked for extra cheddar and onions on my hash browns and instead I got neither and they came out sorta burnt on the outside and cold on the inside.
It only cost $2.99 which would be a perfect deal if it came out how you ordered it and didn't have to wait 30 minutes.
We had terrible service.
Had to wait forever for drink refills and it took forever for our food to come out.
2 other tables were seated and their orders taken before ours was even taken.
When it came time to pay there was nobody at the register until about 5 or so minutes later.
If I weren't so honest I could have walked right off with out paying.
So sad what this place has turned into :(

Rating 2-1/2     For whatever reason, on Saturday night Santa Fe Station closes the Feast Buffet at 9 P.M.
It was 8:50 P.M., on a Saturday night, and I wanted to reward myself with a nice dinner.
With the Feast Buffet closing, I stepped into another Station Casinos icon: The Grand Cafe.
Unfortunately nothing about it is Grand.
The Grand Cafe of today trails behind the Grand Cafe of a few years past in value.
With the exception of their daily special, the prices are inflated.
Gone are the entrees that include a cup of soup.
My dinner: fettuccine, bread, cream of mushroom soup, cola, and tip came to $17.
For that price, I would prefer Olive Garden or Red Lobster.
There were a couple issues that caused me to lower the review by half a star.
Far too much of the fettuccine was taken up by bread.
Attention to beverage refills was slow.
My impression of the Grand Cafe is it is a convenient 24 hour restaurant to grab a bite in Santa Fe Station.
And, if I am not mistaken, Grand Cafe is the go-to place for desserts in Santa Fe Station.
These are my recommendations for the Grand Cafe management to improve their restaurant.
Offer more items, lower the pricing, include soup with all entrees, and provide better refill service on beverages.

I HAVE WALKED OUT OF THIS PLACE 3 TIMES now and won't be back.
I had no choice but to walk out because the wait staff purposely ignore customers in this joint.
There are 10 of them milling around walking past you but they never serve you.
You walk in, get seated, and then get intentionally ignored by pathic waiters who do not want to work.
Don't bother eat here you will not be served.
The food is overpriced Applebees anyway.
I did eat here one time and the food was UNEDIBLE!!!
The meatballs were rock hard.
It was absolutely disgusting.
No human being could eat such garbage.

Let me preface this by saying that I have eaten at SEVERAL of the Grand Cafes in the Stations Chains (the worst by far to this point has been the one at Red Rock) over the years.
I used to eat in them back when they existed the first time, then when they became Denny's and Coco's, and again when they were brought back again as Grand Cafes.
I have to say that with the exception of Kim, Wayne, Charles and Joey on the Graveyard Shift (and they are the reason I raised the overall to 2 stars instead of 1 or 0 stars), I have pretty much had nothing but horrible experiences at the one at the Santa Fe Station.
The most recent issues have occured over the last 2 days (12-29 and 12-30-12).
For starters, they have decided that you can only have one slice of toast (cut in half to "2" pieces of toast) on your breakfast meals.
Then, NONE of their cooks apparently have learned how to cook an egg over-easy.
Next, when you ask for a side of toast (again only one slice cut into halves), it is $2.99 for that one slice of bread.
Then, on their menu it says you can substitute soup or salad, however when you try to order the soup over night, they tell you that they no longer serve soup at night.
I am sure that Stations people won't see this, but I do have to say that if you go to these cafes, you have a better time than I have the last few times.
I hate to say it, but I think I am going to have to start going back to Denny's for my early morning breakfasts.

Food was bland.
Chicken was dry and flavorless, vegetables were overcooked and tasted strange.
Mashed potatoes were good.
Service lacked enthusiasm or any amount of interest in working for a bigger tip.
He was nice enough, but had no energy.
Will never go back.

Went with a friend a few days ago.
Asked for a patio (indoor) table but my request was ignored and after waiting quite a bit we were seated near the counter.
Service was good but the male waiter kept touching my shoulder.
Once or twice is OK but 4-5 times?
Not right.
Came up at one point when he wasn't sure about the drink order and said "I had a brain fart"!
WTH you NEVER say that when you don't know someone well or you're in the service industry job.
Anyway, my patty melt was good which can be served with either fries, cole slaw or fruit.
Menu items were average in # they should be more for a "Grand" Cafe.
Not bad will go back but I hope that waiter won't serve me again!

Came here for dinner b/c we arrived at the hotel late and we were too lazy to go anywhere else.
We had originally picked Oyster Bar but the line was crazy long for only 10 seats and we didn't feel like standing in line for 1+ hours.
Prime rib dinner - For $11.99, this was a darn good deal.
Giant piece of beef, with your choice of baked or mashed potatoes, and some veggies on the side.
The beef was tender and edible and hey, that's the most you can ask for at that price.
Reuben sandwich - Holy moly this sandwich was greasy!
It literally dripped grease the entire time.
Grease aside, I wish they sliced the pastrami thinner as there were definitely pieces that needed to be cut with a knife and not with bare teeth.
Still, it was tasty.
Overall, the Grand Cafe is a nice clean place if you happen to find yourself as the Palace Station hotel and you're looking for a quick place for dinner.

came here because there was a sign outside that said Prime Rib special...  arrived at 11pm on Sat... no special going on  ordered a  t-bone special - fresh and smoky grill asked for medium rare but got rare... too tired/late to complain $10 comes with veggies and asked for mash potatos  turkey sandwich was blah... don't like turkey deli meat

Have not been to the "new" Grand Cafe since it's re-opening.
Originally (like 7 years ago), the prime rib sandwich was OUTSTANDING.
When it was close to the Cafe closure, they went with reheated cheaper cuts of meat and the sandwich was AWFUL.
We decided to give it a try under the re-opening.
Our server and boy I hope his name was Jonathan, was EXCELLENT.
Answered all questions about the prep of the meat and said if we were not happy, he would gladly get us something else.
The sandwich isn't as good as 7 yrs ago but was not awful like our last experience.
The dinner salad was HUGE...and we decided that when we go back we will share both the salad and the sandwich.....it was a lot of food.
Sure do wish they would really make a difference and go back to that original sandwich of 7 years ago!

While staying at the Santa Fe Station Casino recently, I had breakfast in the Grand Cafe'.
My waiter was awesome, the food was good, although a bit pricey.
The decor was beautiful, and the booths very comfortable.
If I stay there again, I won't hesitate to eat there again.

3 stars for our server, James, keeping our drinks full and the quick service provided over all.
That's it.
I used to eat here pretty frequently about 5 years ago and the food was always really delicious, that I remember anyway.
Seems their menu has shrunk considerably and so has the quality of food.
I got the chicken fried steak which was good but totally overloaded with breading, and it was almost as if they fried it to long or it started to get to that point because the edges of the meat and the breading were fried hard.
Eww.
My Cesar salad looked really sad with wilted lettuce.
My hash browns were over fried and my eggs were wet slimy like.
Bleh!
My cousin had the fried chicken which she said was good but her steamed veggies were still hard, complete with dried out carrots and a cold baked potato.
The only reason I would come back here is prob if I was severely intoxicated and it was the last place on earth to eat something to help soak up the cohol.
We had more fun building a mountain out of food we didn't eat.
We felt the food was put to better use and looked nicer that way :)

Read my last review on this place before you read this, then compare.
Once again like in years past, the workers were having some kind of altercation with each other when I got there after midnight.
Like usual the host lady had her back turned and pretended she couldn't see us waiting.
She and the other host lady have been doing this for over 2 years.
This time I asked the server why that lady always ignores us.
He actually explained that she does in fact ignore guests intentionally and that she is just a very jaded and angry worker.
I'm one of those guys who write detailed assessments of food, for example I might say: "The quality and attention the chef put into perfecting the filet to a juicy medium-rare was impressive and well represented the integrity of this restaurant".
But really, the only thing I can say about Grand Cafe is that the "FOOD TASTED LIKE SHIT"  If it's not bad enough that the clientele here are usually extremely drunk and shouting disgusting and stupid things, the food takes about 30-40 minutes to come out so you have to sit there the whole time and endure that shit.
And most the time, the customers leave after about 20 minutes.
I recommend not coming here anymore, even if you are at Santa Fe Station.
Read my review of the Fatburger here at Santa Fe....I would still rather endure the service over there than eat at Grand Cafe.
There are so many local 24 hour gaming bars around town that serve exceptional food and have great service and low prices.
Just go there instead.

I dont know why I come here!
I always get bad service.

As far as the Chicken Fried Steak goes, it was fairly decent and I was pleasantly surprised.
The meat couldn't be cut with only a fork, which isn't necessarily a bad think.
The breading was actually very good and could very well be responsible for putting the "chicken fried" in chicken fried steak.
It was fresh and crispy.
The gravy was thick with a middle-of-road rating for flavor.
Maybe some sausage and a little more pepper would have done the trick.
The meal came with eggs, hash browns and a biscuit.
The hash browns were average at best.
The eggs were cooked as ordered and on par with anywhere else.
At $2.49, the coffee was a little overpriced as was the $3.79 orange juice.
The waitress was friendly as was the keno runner.

Crappy service.
From the hostess to the waiter, they didn't seem to care.
Seemed very understaffed.
Took 40 minutes to get food and had barely six tables worth of customers in the whole place.
Almost left.
Wrong drinks.
Had to chase someone down to get anything.
Food below average.
I get it's a coffee shop so wasn't expecting anything spectacular but this is pretty bad.
Couple of dry patty melts, runny scrambled eggs that were a little tougher than is normal.
Only thing that was somewhat edible was the club sandwich.
Cashier asked how our meal was told her it was bad and about how we were about to leave before food arrived.
She said ....
I'm sorry and will let management know... No wait that wasn't it.
At least that would have been some consolation.
She said... Oh... And nothing else.
Lol ya they just don't give a crap.
Go somewhere else

Service is pretty much non existant!
I watched an 85 yr old woman get up and ask the hostess where the waitress was and she had been waiting longer than us.
After we got our order in, the food came out 40 minutes later and the french toast was so cold it wouldn't even melt the butter.
The problem was that they were seating people at tables that had no waiter/waitress taking care of them.
Obviously severely understaffed and unorganized with management who don't really care.
