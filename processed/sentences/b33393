This place literally just opened.
I didn't really know what to expect, but when I walked in the doors I was immediately greeted by Nick, and he was very nice and down to earth.
This is a shop for people who like to garden/grow plants hydroponically or in the ground.
They have all kinds of gardening supplies and Nick said they will be receiving their seed shipment from Seeds of Change any day now.
I will definitely be back, as my green thumb (or lack thereof) has been sparked:)  P.S.
I was informed that the in the next issue of the New Times, Grotown will have an add to clip out and bring in to save 20% !
!Yay plants:)
