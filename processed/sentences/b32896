I completely disagree with previous reviewers about the outstanding Sage Condominiums in downtown Scottsdale.
Built in 2009 this 3 story Frank Lloyd Wright inspired design with tons of secure underground parking is located just one block to Scottsdale Road and Camelback.
The homes have high end finishes with Dacor and Bosch stainless steel appliances, huge six burner Dacor gas stove and oven, granite counters and deep espresso flat paneled cabinets with plenty of room for every thing you need to make a gourmet meal.
Floors are engineered hardwood through out, every living room has a gas fired fireplace with mantel and room for a flat screen above.
Bathrooms are finished with limestone slab and porcelain tile, with huge walk in closet off the master.
Unit on the East side of the building (Cana side) have lovely views and good morning light, and homes on the West side have full on Camelback views.
The spectacular Club House has gorgeous party room, private wine cellar with wine lockers for every resident, big beautiful pool and spa and barbeque areas for guests.
Residents love living here!
This is downtown Scottsdale's best value for luxury condo living, privacy and convenience to golf, sporting events at Scottsdale Stadium, walk to shopping and dinner and easy access to local entertainment!
