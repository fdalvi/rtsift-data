J T has been doing my handyman work for about three years.
He is conscientiousness with the very best prices.
Fixed refrigerator ice maker,  sink disposal, water heater, ceiling fans, and more.
I am a a retired grandma and I am so happy I found him.
Before J T, I was overcharged for poor work.
Thank you J T.

J.T.
installed a water softener for me recently, and did an immaculate job.
He has also installed a couple ceiling fans for us in the past.
His prices are always very fair, yet I don't have any problem paying for high-quality, honest, friendly service.
It's really nice to know a guy who can fix/install almost anything.
Keep his number handy!

Called for service three times.
Never has returned my call.
