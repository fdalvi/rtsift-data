We were very happy with the care our child received here.
Even though they were very busy, the wait time was not too bad.
The doctor listened carefully to our concerns and we were happy with his explanation of things.

The only reason I give it one star is because the girls at the front were very nice.
However, when we came back and were waiting to see the provider I was more than disappointed.
He walked in without even introducing himself to my husband and I and very rudely told me to "lay your baby down".
First off, if my child is sick and I am bringing him to an urgent care I expect him to be treated with kindness and sympathy, he is a baby!
When he started to exam my son he started talking but my son began to cry so I could not hear him, I told him I couldn't understand him and he began to YELL at me.
He did not take his time with my child and seemed like being here for him was more like torture than his job, he was extremely rude.
I will not be bringing my son back here.
I would tell you the providers name but he did not give it to me!
