Located right next door to Mama Maria's Restaurant, you will find their adjoining panaderia where you can pick up treats for a sweet ending, or to enjoy later with some cafe con leche or chocolate Ibarra!
, There is a wide assortent of pan dulce here, and I also saw Flan, Cheesecake, Tres Leches, Eclairs, and assorted cookies.
There aren't any prices listed, but we decided to try a Bavarian Cream filled Empanada, Peanut Butter Polvoron, and a Puercito which all came out to $2.
They were not the best I've had, but they were okay.
The selections you may find at Mariana's or Cardena's may cost a little more, but the quality is better.
All is not lost though...A Mexican Neveria(Ice Cream Shop) is also next door on the opposite side of Mama Maria's Restaurant, which is quickly becoming one of my favorite spots for desserts and snacks.
ALOHA!!!
YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(50/100) "Baked Goods at Maria's"

The fresh made cookies here are excellent.
The owner is always here making all sorts of bakery delights.
We ordered a wedding cake here when we got married 6 years ago and come back at least twice a month.

Stopped in after a bit of dinner next store, lots of baked goods, custard and jam pastries, bread pudding and empandas.
Several cookies and brownies.
They also have a small amount of party favors and decorations!

I am a Big Fan!
My daughter and her boyfriend and I went into this bakery not speaking any Spanish after going to 3 other bakeries with a request for a tire shaped cake for a baby shower and when we described it to the lady behind the counter she was hesitant about it, but said she would do the best she could do.
We picked up the cake and for the price we paid we were AMAZED...Best tasting cake and the Most wonderful cake I had ever seen...Thank you for a Job Well Done!
You Guys Rock!
I will never order a cake from anywhere else again.
