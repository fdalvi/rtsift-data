I know everyone says Art is subjective, but I want anyone who reads this to check out the picture I took as well.
Look at the disabled Tiger in the window!
Somebody buy that for me please.
I don't know what this business is supposed to be.
They sell both art and furniture, or maybe the furniture is art... Did I mention the wonky tiger?
They had one or two nice pieces of pottery, but nothing that warrants a visit.

I remember walking into this store with my mum, taking one good luck around, then leaving almost immediately.
It's quite... well different stuff, with an attempt to show something exotic and artsy.
It would look ok to great in a bar or hotel but not really in your living room.
