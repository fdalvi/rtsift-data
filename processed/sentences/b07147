Now that Border's has closed they are really the only game in town.
I buy most of my books online at Amazon but come here to browse and then buy my travel guides.

I can't find a single power outlet anywhere!
None in the cafe!
I came here to do work but need a power source to charge my laptop and there are none!
This is horribly disappointing

I love this store location.
It is so big and love how it is two stories.
The employees are very nice and super helpful!
I also love how they have a Starbucks inside.
This store overall is huge and takes a while just to see everything inside!
I definitely prefer coming to this location than other ones around me!
