My friend kept telling me to try this place before the sign was even up, we finally tried it and I haven't stopped going.
At least once a week, sometimes 2-4 times a week when my brother and sister in law are in town.
They love the place too.
It's a great treat on such hot Vegas days and Nights

If you ever had water ice back on the East Coast (especially Philadelphia area), you will love this place.
Being the ex-pat from Philly, and having managed a water ice store in Philly, I sure know a good treat when I find it...and finding it has been rather difficult here, in Vegas.
I love Vegas, but it often lacks in the cuisine that East coast if so famous for.
Well, Frozen Aces brings a taste of home in delicious new and improved ways.
The ices are always fresh with great flavors that are never over-powering or too sweet ( a pet peeve of mine).
Rather the ice treats are refreshing and save you on calories, too!
Perfect for a typical Vegas sunny day.
The atmosphere is very inviting and invigorating.
You have fun colors and modern touches to the interior decorating and there are even IKEA-like stools where you can take that "siesta" and enjoy your frozen treat.
Service is impeccable.
It is truely a family-owned and operated business and it shows in the great customer service and the pride that this family has in their new business.
I highly recommend this place for anyone who is even remotely interested in healthier refreshments on a cold summer night or day.
Heck.
you can enjoy this treat pretty much anytime, it is very affordable, very tasty with many flavors available, fresh and of course, good for you.
Why not give Frozen Aces a try?
You won't be disappointed.

this business is closed :(
