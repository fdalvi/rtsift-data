Went to Denny's this morning for breakfast with my twins and fiance.
We walked in the door and their was no hostess which is understandable if they are busy but they really weren't.
We had at least five servers look dead at us as well as cooks and stood there for a good five minutes and still no one said anything to us so we walked out and went to the McDonald's across the street.

always great food with great service.
Nothing too fancy but fills you up and gets you on the way.
