Everyone I talk with who has had this pizza loves it.
I think it is fine, but love it, nope.
No matter how I cook these things it turns out much more soggy than I would like.
The ingrediants are fine but they sure do give off a lot of moisture when baking it.
So it is not horrible, just not really to my liking.

we absolutely love the cheesy bread and the cinnamon wheel...BUT the pizza is just okay.
the take-and-bake concept is new to me so i knew that it was going to be hit or miss.
we ordered 2 pizzas and baked them following the instructions that came with it.
the crust on the first pizza didn't really bake well so i added a couple more minutes to the baking time with the second pizza but the inner crust was still kinda soggy.
like i said, the pizza is just okay.
the next pizza we'll have will be delivered to my front door :-)

Had it a few times.
stuffed pizza's are the best.
cookie dough is great.
will be back.

The pizza is incredible, they use really high quality ingredients and the prices are great.
I would recommend cooking it on the bottom rack of your oven for a slightly better texture on the crust.
I want someone to mark that this post is funny, so I will add a joke:  Mushroom walks into a bar... Bartender says, "sorry, we don't serve your type here.
" Mushroom says "why not?
I'm a fungi (fun guy).

Tried this place for the first time.
Never again!
It looks good but it tastes horrible!
Nothing wrong with service, just think the company doesn't get the best ingredients.

So why would I cook my own pizza?
Because at this place I can get just artichokes and sun dried tomatoes and I'm willing to heat my house with the oven to have it my way!
