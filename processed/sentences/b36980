This place is the TRUTH!
I've been shopping @ Frederick's for years.
I visited the store in Arizona Mills a few months back, but it's a bit out of the way for me.
I just learned of this new outlet store yesterday (Black Friday).
This is their ONLY outlet store in the country, so consider yourselves lucky PHX-metro ladies!
They were offering lots of specials for Black Friday, but even their regular prices are clearance.
They have a "damaged" section that has items deeply discounted; some of which aren't even damaged!
Also, they have lots of bras for the over C- cup crowd and "uncommon" size girls (32-band) like myself.
I got a satin robe for $5 dollars, bras for $8 and some panties.
Nicky was a very helpful sales associate.
She helped me with the corsets of which I purchased 2!
I will definitely be back!

The outlet closed just before Christmas.
I work in the same building complex and was here 4-6 times a month.The ladies were fabulous, Nikki, Mary Ellen and the whole gang were so helpful.
I'm sad that the building was sold.
I have hundreds of items from Freddi's and loved each.

This was a great little outlet store.
Tried to get a few things just before valentines day this year and found that it was under construction.
Does anyone know if it will reopen, move, etc?
