Dragon House used to be called Zen Gourmet.
Dragon House still serves chinese food, but the best part about this place is the Seafood Hot Pot buffet.
Seafood Hot Pot is $18.99, but since this place is having its grand opening, they have a special price of $15.00 for seafood hot pot.
This place has fresh Dungeness crab, clams, mussels, beef, chicken, coagulated blood pudding, and excellent vegetables ready for you to cook.
There is also a wide variety of sauces for dipping your food into.
Inside is not the best looking, as it still looks a little old with the orange paint inside.
I took away a star because service was a little slow.
There was only one waitress serving the entire restaurant with tea, water, clearing plates, etc.
Overall, I will be back as their dungeness crab for hot pot is the best deal.

Not sure what happened to the review I posted couple of weeks ago.
Anyway, been back to this tiny hole in the wall restaurant about 5 times since (mostly for their dirt cheap lunch specials).
So I feel I have more to share about this place than my original review, which was just on the hot pot experience during their opening weekend promotion.
About the hot pot.
It is a seafood buffet Chinese hot pot style.
And you have a choice of soup bases to select from (regular, spicy and this Chinese herbal concoction).
The spicy one is pretty spicy, so keep that in mind when making your selection.
The cool part is that the pot has a partition, so you can order two soup bases.
The buffet originally was arranged in a manner that would have totally failed a health inspection (raw meat over vegetables, and other items that may not required as long of a cooking time, and just poor food storage techniques on the buffet line), but on my most recent visit (yesterday) they have make significant improvements, even though they still have some ways to go to be in the A range.
Originally the hot pot was $10 (50% off), but that promotion ended almost immediately after the restaurant opened.
Now it is $15 per person, which is still an excellent deal, but may one day be offered at the regular price of $20.
The selection of the food is pretty good.
I love the dumplings that they have, which along with the fish fillet, makes this a great deal for me.
Plus, hot pot is great during the cold months, and the restaurant is pretty packed at nights.
They also have a good selection of other vegetables (some I don't even know the English name for) and mushrooms!
The selection of condiments to customize your dipping sauce is good, and is now even better with labels telling you what the heck they are now.
The one thing I didn't like about the hot pot experience here is the hodgepodge of dishes and plates available at the buffet line.
It looks disorganized, and gives the perception that they are putting out all the plates, bowls and other dishes they can find in the restaurant.
The lunch and dinner specials start at $4.95, even though they still have the banner that states the lunch & dinner specials starting at $3.95 and is available all day (which for awhile was the best deal in town).
The portions are decent, and with the side of rice, will satisfy even the amateur competitive eaters amongst us.
My favorites in the $4.95 specials are the two pork chops entrees (one is spicy and the other one is not, but both are fried perfectly and served piping hot and still juicy inside).
The walnut prawns is excellent and a great value.
Service is friendly, but could be slow or inadequate on a busy dinner rush, since I see only one waitress working on all my visits to the restaurant.
The friends I brought to this restaurant all have positive impression about the restaurant, in spite of the noticeable flaws or areas of improvement that we can all clearly observed.
And the fact that I know and can see the steady improvements in the way they set up the buffet and serve great tasty food, encourages me to come back time and again when I am in the area.
Decor: 3/5 It is a hole in the wall, but at least they try to put up classical Chinese paintings to contribute to the theme.
Service: 3.5/5 It is hard to be the cashier/waitress/busser and do all of it solo most of the time.
Price/Value: 4.5/5  $4.95 + tax gets you a lot of quality Chinese food.
$15 is reasonable for a seafood hot pot buffet.
Location: 3/5  Not in the best part of town, and definitely not in the best lot in that part of town.
But sometimes you have to live dangerously to get yummy Chinese food at a low price.
Good for group???
As long as the group is not too large, since I don't see any lazy susans on the table (if you intend to order and share the entrees family style).
For hot pot it is ideal for up to 4 or 5 per hot pot, but it is not difficult to have two set up at a table for larger groups.

We had been wanting to try out this place since it first opened up about a month ago.
Price for their AYCE Chinese fondue was $10 a person when the restaurant first opened up.
This special only lasted a few days.
Now their special is 20% off of the $18.99 price per person.
So for $15 you get AYCE fondue with lots of items to select from.
We had beef, lamb, squid, shrimp, kidney, fish balls, wonton, a couple of other kind of dumplings, and crab.
They also had a variety of other organs that we did not try out.
We also had loads of spinach, watercress and napa cabbage.
The vegetables absorb the broth's flavour when boiled after the other meats are cooked.
The raw crab was brought to our table and was not on the AYCE table of items that you help yourself to.
It was so fresh and sweet.
Actually all the ingredients were very fresh and there were quite the selection of dipping sauces that were very savory.
Top marks for their wonton and shrimp dumplings, they were absolutely delicious.
I would come back just to have this if nothing else.
When it's freezing outside, go try out their AYCE fondue (hot pot), it's sure to keep you warm and fulfilled.
Will definitely go back again!
I took one star off because of their orange colour wall paper decoration and no pork and chicken on the buffet line.

I have been here a lot recently to pick up items I ordered off of their lunch special menus, which ends at 4pm, in spite of the banner hanging outside stating that they have specials all day.
Anyway, I feel that their food is good overall, and at lunch special pricing ($4.95 or $5.95) is great on the wallet and your tummy.
Unlike some other restaurants that take their time to prepare your order, the cooks working in the back is super fast making your lunch.
On my most recent visit just last week at about 2pm, my two orders were prepared, boxed and brought out in under 4 minutes.
It was so hot that I burnt my tongue eating a little of it in the car, before I set off to my appointment.
Their crab entrees also look really good, and the size of the crabs they serve is pretty big.
You can see the crabs in the tank with the lobsters.
Anyway, I would be here even more often if it was closer.
We were also here recently for an UYE.
The food we ordered were all good, nothing to really complain about.
I know the waitress really wanted us to order one of the veggie dishes, but we politely declined, since we each picked an item to order, and none of us happened to pick a vegetable dish :p  And from speaking to the waitress, the business at the restaurant is pretty much split between hot pot patrons and those ordering off the menu.
Labeling items on the hot pot buffet still needs work, but they seem to be getting better.
Progress is always good.

Great food cooked super fast and offered at a great price,especially for the lunch specials ($4.95 to $5.95).
Portions are generous with the rest of the menu as well.
Perfect for a group meal at a very reasonable price.
My brother and his friends were visiting from SoCal the other day, and original plan was to go hit up an AYCE Sushi place for dinner, before one of his friends got sick before dinner.
So I ended up taking the group here and ordering Chinese take-out to bring back and eat in the room.
Everything was great, even the soup noodle that we ordered(which was packed in a way that makes it still good to assemble in the room: very hot soup in one large container, the rest of the components in others, including the thinly sliced rare beef which we "shabu shabu" in the hot broth back in the hotel room).
As a crew that is used to really good Chinese food at competitive prices from Monterey Park, they all agreed that it was very good for Las Vegas.
I dropped by again today to grab some lunch specials and work my way through their lunch special menus.
The Curry Chicken was excellent, and the way the chef cooks the chicken was done in a way that truly shows that he has some serious culinary background.
The chicken was still soft and succulent, plus the portion was generous.
Good flavor, fine techniques, generous portions, and attractive prices =  I will be a frequent repeat customer as long as I live in Las Vegas.
As for the AYCE Hotpot/fondue, the counter where all the ingredients are usually kept is empty today.
The waitress told me that the temperature has been warm, so they stop putting out the ingredients out and offering it as AYCE.
Hot pot is still offered but must be ordered a la carte, so depending on how much you can eat your final tab may be less or more expensive than before, but allthe ingredients will be that much fresher.
Here is a brief price list: All veggies are $2.95 - tofu, spinach, cabbage,mushrooms, wontons, egg noodles, etc.
Some meats are $3.95 - pork blood, sliced chicken, sliced beef, pork intestine, pork liver, pork kidney.
Some meats are $4.95 - Sliced Fatty Beef, Sliced Fatty Lamb and Beef Tripe.
All Seafoods are $4.95 - Clams, Shrimps, Sliced Fish, Squids, Fish Balls, Fish Tofu and Mussels.
Lobsters $12.95  (I think it is a fair deal) Crab $12.95 Oysters $5.95 Scallops $5.95

They got rid of the all you can eat seafood hot pot buffet!
We were looking forward to eating the hot pot and walked away so disappointed.
I guess they were losing money on it but they should have increased the price a little.
Some hot pot restaurants have the ingredients in individual plates that are displayed in a refrigerator where you can just grab what you want and you get charged by the color of the plate.
Now the restaurant has a list that you can check off what you want but it's difficult if you don't know the exact name of the vegetable you want.
I hope they go back to the AYCE seafood hot pot buffet .
please!

**Summary**        - Value - The price is on par with other Chinese restaurants, but the portion size is larger.
They also don't try to fill the entree's with filler and jip you out of the good stuff.
They also offered me a $5 coupon of a $20 meal when i came in.
- Decor - The place doesn't look the greatest.
The outside looks a little shady.
The inside feels like you're actually in China (That's not a good thing).
I only stayed because I was already there, but I'm definitely coming back because of the surprisingly good food.
- AYCE Hot Pot - They ceased the buffet for the summer and might bring it back in the fall.
The hot pot (Cook your own food in boiling water.
Like shabu-shabu or fondue) can be ordered a-la-carte and shouldn't be confused with what they call hot pot on the main menu, which is actually clay pot (Entree served inside a clay pot).
**Ordered**        - $10.95 House Special Hot Pot - The portion size is definitely a leg up on other Chinese restaurants.
The flavor was great and they didn't try to fill the pot with mushrooms and Chinese cabbage like other places.
Nope, it's all seafood.
The tofu was also fried which is a lot more tasty compared to not fried.
(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nbTwuhnXEyQRzPIAfGNS8w?select=pjiw6Weqh5RdXS_m20xR6g)        - $7.95 Singapore Style Vermicelli - So so, and pretty spicy.
- $3.95 Won Ton Noodle in Soup - 5-6 won tons, noodles, and kai-lan (Chinese broccoli) in soup.
Each won ton had a pretty big size shrimp in the middle.
Definitely worth the price.
- $16.95 Small Lobster with Yee Mein (Flag Egg Noodles) - You have a variety of sauces to cook it with.
We went with the traditional ginger and green onion sauce.
The flavor of the lobster covers the noodles and makes the noodles that much more delicious.
(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nbTwuhnXEyQRzPIAfGNS8w?select=5tpwBlyAuZoi40lk7c3I4g)        - $8.95 Diced Beef with Black Pepper Sauce - One of my favorite Cantonese dishes.
The beef was tender and the portion was generous.
- $9.95 Half Roast Duck - Duck was a little dry.
I didn't see hanging ducks anywhere so I think they might buy their duck elsewhere and serve it.
- $9.95 Squid with Salt and Pepper - The oil they used to fry this seems a bit old, but the flavor and seasoning was very yummy.
(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nbTwuhnXEyQRzPIAfGNS8w?select=XM_NmCcL6I-V2vg4_3YVZg).
**Recommendations**        - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a cheap quality Chinese restaurant and don't mind the surroundings.

We came here for lunch as they were advertising $1.88 bowls of wonton soup and congee.
We ordered the salt and pepper deep fried pork chop, wonton noodle soup and frog leg congee.
They must have changed chefs as their pork chop was not at all tasty and the frog leg congee was lacking in flavor too.
But for $11 total, I shouldn't complain.
If you want a cheap lunch, stick with their wonton noodle soup.
It's really not bad for the price.

I've been here multiple times for the last 5 months and no review.
Why?
I wanted to fully review the place after having an actual sit down meal here.
Never happened and might not until they get the hot pot buffet going again in winter.
Misti convinced me I could still write a review of a place I've only sat in waiting for my togo order.
Why don't I ever eat here?
It's always just me and the lady in there when I order.
I don't care about eating at a table for 1 but not when I'm literally the "one".
Everything I've ordered has been solid.
Not only do they have the cheapest whole lobsters and crabs in LV cooked multiple ways, they can do it all.
I really like the seafood noodles, anything with rock cod and all the beef dishes.
Yeah yeah...really narrowing it down there.
Can't go wrong with anything.
Sure it's in a divey plaza and basically an indoor desert during dinner time.
But who the heck cares when scallion and ginger lobster is $14?!?!
I hope this place has the legs to stick around town a while.
Go!

After my very first UYE held here months ago, I said I would return, and I finally did.
This time there were a few lows as well as highs, but the food was spot on five-star quality most of the meal--or feast--again.
I knew that my party of four would be ordering lots, and when we entered the restaurant with its nicely redecorated walls, only one couple was there, so I asked for a lazy Susan table.
I'm sure the likely proprietor who graciously assented to this request did not regret letting us occupy a table for 8, because by the end of our repast smokin' dishes were being added next to dinner plates because the lazy Susan was already full of entrees.
We all shared Fried Dumplings with Potsticker Sauce, Hoisin Sauce, and Chili Oil; an order of Egg Rolls with Sweet & Sour Sauce and Hot Mustard that was not very spicy; House Special Wonton Soup; Shrimp with Walnut & Mayonnaise Sauce; Orange Peel Chicken; Sweet & Sour Shrimp; Stir Fried Vegetables; Mongolian Beef; Steamed White Rice; and specially requested Shrimp with Ham Fried Rice.
Whew!!
I washed the food down with a good and hot Chinese tea and a Sprite.
At first I was a little disappointed that the Sprite came in a can, but when I found out it only cost $1, it was all fine.
Plus, a glass of ice and a straw were automatically served with soft drinks.
We ordered so much food that I had to chase down our server to add my entree orders of Mongolian Beef and Shrimp with Ham Fried Rice.
My wife thought she was convinced that we already had enough food coming--and we probably did.
But I like variety, and wanted to make the best of this dinner outing.
There was also a language barrier problem to a degree.
Initially I had said that I would wait after all others in my group and fill in dishes around what they had ordered.
But this may have been taken to mean that I was just deferring to the others' choices.
When I asked the young man who brought the appetizers to our table for Hoisin Sauce, he could not understand me, and brought out our server, who seemed like she owned the place, and understood and promptly fulfilled my request.
But the lady tried to do too much herself.
Eventually three Shabu-Shabu pots on portable burners were boiling, with cooking patrons demanding ever more ingredients; tables of diners had grown to five parties, plus a steady stream of take-out orders; and the poor woman was becoming frazzled as we were seemingly forgotten and unattended for a time, with empty soup bowls and plates piling up on our table.
And, initially, air conditioning currents raging on a rainy day were wreaking havoc with the temperature of food on our plates until the pulsing ventilation nearby was turned off at our request.
Once again, a big hit for me was the House Special Wonton Soup, which was more like Wor Wonton Soup, as chock-full as it was with meats, vegetables, and lovely wontons floating in the tasty chicken broth that were each filled with a whole large shrimp AND ball of pork.
The Orange Peel Chicken and Sweet & Sour Shrimp were both sweet and slightly spicy; the Shrimp with Walnut & Mayonnaise Sauce sweet and very tasty; Mongolian Beef quite lean and made with both white and green onions; and the Stir Fried Vegetables contained a nice mix of Napa Cabbage, broccoli crowns and stems; bean sprouts, and carrots.
The fried rice was enjoyable, with big shrimps, moist rice, and the added flavor of ham; the chunks of ham appeared to be brown in color rather than red, which was a bit of a surprise to me.
Soy sauce was on our table but I never saw a need to use it even once!
The only minor disappointments for me were a too thin Potsticker Sauce and a weak Sweet & Sour Sauce.
I liked the crunchy all-vegetable Egg Rolls, and the Potstickers were basically okay.
What was a real shock though was a foul-tasting fortune cookie at meal's end.
It was not stale but had a really vile taste to it that lingered in the mouth to the degree that immediately after our departure, one of our party bought welcome mints for all of us at the market next door.
What really counted the most though was the food, and Dragon House's chef knows his craft, for it was by and large excellent and delicious.
But the service we experienced was just too discombobulated to earn anything higher than a 4-star rating on this particular dining expedition.

Hit or miss.
Food's not the freshest, but it's not that bad.
Really cheap and big portions.

This place gets good reviews, but based on my one experience getting take-out I doubt I'd come back.
We opted for two classic American-Chinese dishes -- mongolian beef and cashew chicken.
Each dish was a ridiculously large serving, probably enough for two or three people.
Too bad the quality wasn't on par with the quantity.
The mongolian beef was mushy and chewy.
The cashew chicken way too bland.
I'm sure the food would be better if you eat IN the restaurant, but the next time I need an American-Chinese fix I'll be heading elsewhere.

I've only been here twice for the all you can eat seafood hot pot buffet last year and both times I loved it.
It's great on a cold windy night when you're craving something hot and soupy.
The variety is great.
Lots of seafood and meats to choose from, plenty of veggies, and a whole lotta dipping sauces to choose from.
What made this place even better was the price for the buffet.
It's too bad they got rid of it I wish they would bring it back.

Had a wonderful dinner tonight at Dragon House.
We ordered their AYCE fondue (hot pot) and it was delicious.
Now, you have to order the items that you want to eat/cook and they bring out the plates for you to cook yourself.
They use to have everything out for you to pick yourself, but I found that when they bring out the items from the kitchen to the table, the ingredients are much more fresher.
The sliced beef, lamb and oysters are to die for.
Wow, it was so fresh and the oysters were huge.
We ordered a wide selection of items including shrimp, scallops, and wonton.
Everything was excellent.
The service was very attentive.
What more can I say, 5 stars all the way this time.
The orange colour wall paper doesn't bother me anymore.

I had hoped to find some good chinese food at a good price and did my yelp research.
We needed to stay off of the strip as it was closed down for a marathon last sunday night.
Reviews led me to Dragon House.
We meet two people there and it was disconcerting that at 4-5:30pm we were the only customers the whole time.
But that did make the service good and the food hot.
The egg rolls as an appetizer and the hot sour soup were both quite tasty.
I had read of the pork chop with salt and pepper and we ordered that along with Szechuan shrimp and a whole duck.
Some very simple brown rice came with it.
I can't say that the duck or pork chop was anything to remember or reorder.
Two people at our table were put off by the serving of the duck head on the plate.
So overall, the place was clean, the service attentive and the food served hot.
I doubt I will want to go back and will instead try other places in search of good Chinese food in Las Vegas.
Suggestions accepted.

Don't ever try their hot pot menu.
Any Chinese family can make better than theirs.
Not try to be a hater, but there are tons authentic good Chinese restaurants over there with decent price.

New management has come in and the menu choices have been cutdown a lot.
No more crab or lobster offered but they'll do it if you ask.
They say it's the same chef as before but I have my doubts after getting chicken fried rice where the chicken appeared almost deep fried and breaded.
That would be awesome Chinese fried rice for a redneck in the middle of the deep south!!
Not sure what liquid the lo mein was drowning in either but it wasn't what I wanted at all.
In a nutshell, this place has gone all Red Shrimp Company to cater to the Chimerican palate except Red Shrimp does it better.
I can't say I'll be back.
So disappointing!!

Been putting off updating this review since my last visit in mid December 2011, when I learned that the old Dragon House is no more.
Sure the name is still the same, but operating under a different management, with a more concise/abridged menu options and possibly the chef is new too.
Anyway, I was in the area after watching one of the NFL games, and decided to drop in for dinner.
The place still looks the same, but the staff are all different and the menu I was given was different too.
I asked and the young lady/cashier confirmed that the restaurant has recently changed owners.
The new menu now is pretty much a cookie cutter generic American Chinese restaurant menu, at least for now.
I hope.
Gone are the crab, lobster, calamari, and fish that were on the old menu, which was one of the main reasons for dropping in for a seafood feast at the Dragon House.
What you get now are your typical chicken, beef, pork Chinese take-out menu, with the only seafood option being shrimp and 1 fish (probably frozen cod or tilapia) entree.
The food I ordered and ate was prepared quickly and properly, nothing really wrong with it, except it just lacked that certain pizazz I have come to appreciate in the former Dragon House.
I will still come back and give it another try if I happen to be in the area, but in its present generic Chinese take-out incarnation, there is really no point in driving out of the way for its offering.
Decor: 3/5 It is still a hole in the wall, with little or no new facelift since the new management change.
Service: 3/5 The lady that was the cashier spoke perfect English and was proficient in her job, but the new waiter still seems a little lost.
Food:  2/5  It is still made by a Chinese chef, but the menu took out that extra BAM!
when it got zapped with a de-evolution ray.
Price/Value: 3/5  Generic pricing for generic American Chinese take-out food.
No longer the great value it used to be.
Location: 2/5  Not in the best part of town, and definitely not in the best lot in that part of town.
Without the yummy Chinese food at a terrific price, I am not sure if it is worth it to venture out of your way here.

No freaking way!
This place had the best all you can eat hot pot in the entire las Vegas valley!
I knew they were eventually going to close because business was slow, not too many people knew about this place.. Their hot pot was so cheap and had a really good broth... RIP dragon house...
I love you guys..
So sad this placed closed!,:
