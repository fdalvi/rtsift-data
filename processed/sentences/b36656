good produce, nice variety.
They are trying hard to be a viable alternative to the big supermarket.
Not convinced that they are 'local' produce all the time but they do make an effort to bring in local products which is a good thing.
Produce quality seems generally to be very good.

Dutchie's used to only be at the St. Jacob's Farmers Market in St. Jacobs, but now you can have all the fresh, flavourful produce that you're used to getting from Dutchie's at the farmers market all week long at the Dutchie's Fresh Market.
But wait, there's more!
A selection of dairy items from Hewitt's, as well as a full butcher counter, as well a number of gluten-free products, all in a very clean and brightly lit store.
The prices aren't always the lowest, but the quality standard is good and sometimes they have awesome deals!
A trip to Dutchie's is also great fun, too, as they have a great greeter in the front of the store and there always seems to be samples (today they were doing apple cider), I always leave there with a smile...
Thanks Dutchie's for making my day!

Every time I go and I go a lot, I always find the freshest produce and really great deals.
I love going here as you always feel like a guest and not just someone they are trying to get money from.
I do however recommend not going during busy times as it gets crazy busy there.
So early weekday mornings or later evenings.

Will not go back.
Bread was moldy the next day and the fruit I purchased was of very poor quality.
I had a few green grapes left over from Central Fresh market purchased on Tuesday last and still ok today....seven days.
Dutchies purchased on Friday got tossed out today as the were all bad.
Bought peaches too and squishy in a bad way and no flavor.
