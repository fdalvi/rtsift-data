My daughter attended this pre school for 4 yrs and now is attending the elementary school, she has definitely received loving care due to the amazing staff!
There education & learning is beyond exceptional!
Would recommend Green Valley Christian to anyone looking for loving, quality christian care & great education!

Just moved my son here after a bad week at another preschool in the area.
They were soooo incredibly nice and gave me a tour when I dropped in unexpectedly and rushed our application on a friday afternoon so that we could start on monday.
Love them for that!
So far, so good!
Im super excited to see my son blossom here!

To sum this school up in one word: incredible!
My older daughter went through the pre-school program and she was more than ready for CCSD kindergarten.
She exited the program able to recognize all her upper and lower case letters, their phonemic sounds, and how to write them.
She could also read, write and recognize numbers 1-20, all basic colors and all basic shapes.
She was prepared with learning how to sit for a lesson, in chairs for seat work, how to work cooperatively in groups and listen to teachers.
Weekly, the students go to "chapel" for worship and song.
Each class  takes turns throughout the year to deliver the message on stage.
There is plenty of fun and love that takes place during the day.
My younger daughter is now attending the four year old program and I have no doubt in my mind that she will be ready for kindergarten also next year.
The teachers we have had go above and beyond for the children in their care.
I felt good about leaving my daughters in their care, knowing that if there is any trouble the school is quick to communicate with me.
I can't sing the praises louder for such a great school!
