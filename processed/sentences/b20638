This place has PHENOMENAL Indian food.
It's true to the culture and very authentic.
Try it and you'll be blown away.

I must agree with the first reviewer, sensational indian.
I would have given it 5 stars had the dudes working there at least cracked a smile...I've been there at least 10 times and not even a twitch.
Great food though and only do takeaway.

They've jumped a to a stellar 5 stars... not because the food rose to another level as I really don't think it possible, being top of the Indian taste ladder as they are, but because...wait for it, I managed a joke with the guy behind the counter!!!
Finally!
Wonders never cease and the Delta Indian Takeaway is No.1!!
