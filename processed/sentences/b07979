This store is IN Metrocenter Mall on the upper level.
Overall 3.6-4 stars  5 stars for selection, style, cuteness/sexyness.
Major awesome points for sexy bras for cups over size C. It should NOT be as hard as it is to find a cute, fun, flirty, sexy bra when you have DD's.
But it is... & it sucks.
3 stars for prices.
Yes, it's a brand.
I understand this.
But it almost hurts me to spend $40 on a bra.
Luckily sometimes they can have some pretty good sales.
I wasn't inundated by sales associates asking if they could help me.
Thank you!
Just let me look around.
If I need your help I'll make sure to ask for it.
Of course there are other things besides just bras here.
Panties, shirts, shorts, nighties, lotions, & perfumes to name a few.

I came in on a weekday late afternoon since I had a coupon for a free panty and $10 off a bra.
The salespeople were helpful and friendly but not pushy, which I really appreciated!!
Usually it seems like Victoria's Secret sales associates are always trying to upsell and convince me to buy things I don't want, so this is now my favorite location, even though the mall it's in isn't super nice.
The associates all appeared to be bilingual (spanish) also.
I will definitely be back!
