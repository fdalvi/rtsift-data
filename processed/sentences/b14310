Tiny.
A deli case and a meat case.
Both filled with quality products.
Staff is quick, on-the-ball and friendly.
Come with an idea, not a plan.
Buy what looks best, or what you can afford.
It's not cheap - quality never is.
There are a few dry good items like pasta - but if you are looking for that kind of stuff, head to Romanelli's...don't come here.
Come here for the meat.
They specialize in corn-fed Iowa beef.
If you are looking for grass-fed...I don't think these are the droids you are looking for, but they might be able to order it?
What I DO know: is that the ribeye I had from here yesterday was AWESOME (so well marbled).
Melted in my mouth.
The hot dogs and sausages looked mighty tasty - but that's for another day...

By far my fav place!
Al and Trudy offer exceptional customer service and product.
I was never a huge meat eater but i must say when you have the best its hard to turn away.They always offer cooking tips and techniques, which are greatly appreciated!
The stuffed peppers are a must when you visit!
My husband and I try to get up here every few weeks, sometimes just because we enjoy the two owners so much!

The owners, Al and Trudy and their staff don't just sell the meat, they're knowledgeable about all the cooking techniques as well.
Their customer service is exceptional and the meat is very high quality.
We really enjoy the rib eye and the porterhouse.
Though everything is quite good.
They also have hard to find food items from Itsly.
Shop here, you won't regret it.

Just stopped in at Al's after a few years living away from the West Valley.
It's the same as before .
excellent!
They are closed SUN-MON-TUE, but plan ahead (it's a "Mom and Pop" kinda place and they deserve time off too).
I purchased some awesome steaks that melted in our mouths and some chicken breasts that were downright delicious!
I also picked up a couple of frozen meat loafs for the freezer.
Best meat loaf hands down.
What can I say?
I really missed Al's.
Nothing's changed.
I'll be back for sure.
