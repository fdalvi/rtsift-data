Bob is great.
His wife Beth answers when you make appointments and she is very nice and helpful.
They have installed outside lighting and run coax for me and did a terrific job.
They have reasonable rates and are very personable and professional.
I highly recommend them if you need electrical work for your home.

Love this guy.
We needed a new electrical line installed.
Everything was perfect.
We have limited experience with home repair projects and were nervous about the process and price.
No need.
Thanks so much for the prompt response for a bid and then listening to our needs and worries.
Call Bob!!!

Had some work done today by Egan Electric.
I received their name from a recommendation from someone on Ocotillo Friends website.
I called and scheduled an appointment.
Bob came out and I told him what I wanted and he said he can do it all.
We were scheduled to have the work done on Monday but there was an opening today and worked better for us.
Bob and his son showed up right on time.
They went over what work was to be preformed.
They went to pick up a few needed supplies and started the work.
They installed pennant lights in our kitchen, added several dimmer switches, added canned lights to our patio area, installed a cable outlet and an additional electrical outlet.
They were on time, very polite, very clean and wanted to make sure we were completely satisfied.
They did a great job for us and I would definitely and will recommend them to our friends or anyone looking for electrical work to be done.
Thanks again Bob.
My wife and I are completely happy with everything you did for us today.
