My fianc√© and I went to Archi's when the kid was in school.
We asked for the Pork Pad Thai.
We also ordered the chicken panang and they both were a delight.
The restaurant was pretty comfortable spacious unlike many Thai bistros or restaurants.
I appreciated the decor it was very nice inside.
I gave it a four because they were not busy at all on our waitress was not really on top of our drinks.
It was a warm day and spicy food ='s Need for water and Tea.
After our meal we had some scrumptious Coconut ice cream after our meal and it helped cool us off.
Being that the place is one block from our home it will be a new spot for me and my girl.
I posted a menu link for this Thai restaurant.
Hope you enjoy it as much as we did.

I lunched here today with a coworker.
The decor and atmosphere are delightful.
The food was delicious!
I ordered the chicken with basil lunch special (lvl 4 spicy).
My friend had the green curry chicken (lvl 7 spicy).
I will order it more spicy next time, but the dish was very flavorful, fresh and delicious.
The egg roll and the fried wontons were standard, nothing special.
The soup of the day was nice and refreshing, although one bite of the big chunk of ginger was a bit overpowering.
We weren't told the name of the soup, but it was in a broth with chicken, lemongrass and veggies.
The lunch specials were a deal at 6.95 each, and the portions are not skimpy!
I will return here soon!

I had a very similar experience to Jill C.'s.
I also had the Basil Chicken lunch special and I thought it was great, also great was the $6.95 price.
I ordered the level 5 spiciness and it really wasn't hot at all.
I will definitely keep this place in my lunch spot rotation.

Great Thai food!
Been to Thailand many times and this is the real deal!

I have eaten in once and I had take out again tonight - about the 6th time I've had Thai food from here.
It is wonderful!
I really like the place, but since it's so close to my house and my wife doesn't do Thai, I get her Chinese on West Charleston and then bop over here to get my dinner for home.
I have been through all of their curries.
I usually get an 8 spiciness and I could go higher.
Next time, I'll do 9 for a try.
I really enjoyed the one time I ate in.
The restaurant is very nice.

This place is consistently great.
I've been here for lunch and dinner and enjoyed it every time.
For lunch, I definitely recommend ordering off the lunch section on the back of the menu.
Food is great and the price is a good deal.
For dinner, I recommend starting out with the Tom Yum soup.
Noodles are fantastic, as are the curries, and the fried rice is delicious.
The only disappointing thing I've had was the shrimp roll appetizer.
It was whole shrimp wrapped in rice paper and deep fried, which was not at all what I was expecting.
One thing to note is Archi's has a few restaurants around town and the numeric scale they use to tell how spicy you want a dish is not consistent.
A 4/10 at one location is more like an 8/10 at another.

Consistent.
Love coming here for casual dining.
Very clean, friendly.
The food is spot on.
This time around had the ginger, ginger beef and curry pandang wit chicken.
It was delicious.
Great Thai food!

When my youngest son and his fiancee brought me here yesterday for Lunch...
I thought to myself as I walked in.... "I've been here before... but when?".
They tried to bring me here last year when I was visiting, but Archi's Thai was closed that day...
They took me to another place... and was extremely disappointed.
As you can see by the rating, Archi's was a pleasant surprise and very good Thai cuisine... judging by the Lunch Specials.
As I told the kids... Archi's is deserving of 5-Stars for the sampling of the Lunch Special... and if the Dinners were as good and consistent as the Lunch Special that I had.
Atmosphere is most unlike Southeastern Asian....
The decor is set in medium dark woods... furniture is French Provincial in style... pictures are, surprisingly, of Thailands French Colonial days with framed pictures of their former Royalty in Thailand of days gone by.
You will be surprised by this atmosphere... a little of French Colonial in an Asian restaurant.
On the menu....  Tom Yum Soup (**** Complimentary) Lemongrass, Lime Leaves and Blue Ginger infused Broth, Mushrooms, Tomatoes and Lime Juice... sprinkled with Cilantro and Green Onions.
For a smallish 3" diameter cup / bowl... this Soup could be considered Thailand's version of Chinese Hot and Sour Soup.
Dang good... but left me wanting more... but it's complimentary.
Lunch Special #4 - Red Curry Dish with Beef (***** $6.95 Shrimp-$7.95) Fresh Red Curry Paste in Coconut Milk with Zucchini, Bamboo Shoots (a lot of 'em), Basil, and Bell Peppers.
When you order this... the wait-staff will ask you the degree of Hot-ness that you want your Soup (from 1 to 10... with 1 being a lack of Heat and 10 being Super Hot)...
I was considering ordering the Soup with a 10... My son and his fiancee looked at me quizzically or amazingly.
They really tried to convince me to reconsider....
I tried this tactic...
I asked the waitress... "If you ordered this, what number would you order?
" She replied with a 6.
So, I compromised.... 8.
When the Soup came out, The Soup was accompanied by a very small Green Salad which was totally inconsequential considering it's size; a Thai Egg Roll (***)...
I really don't like totally Veggie Egg Rolls, and a thinly fried Won-Ton (****).
This was just a small sampling of from their extensive menu.
The Red Curry Soup was something else altogether... As you travel West across SouthEast Asia... you'll notice that the Asian countries will be more influence by Indian Cuisine as you travel.
This Soup was silky smooth from the Coconut Milk and the Red Curry gave it a warm color and unique flavor that only Curry can impose.
Coconut based Soups are some of my very favorite.
If I had to penalize the Soup for any reason, it would be for the amount of Bamboo Shoots... just too much.
Otherwise, something you should try whether it be a Lunch Special or at Dinner.
Lunch Special #5 - Spicy Basil Dish with Beef (***** $6.95) Stir Fried with Zucchini, Bell Peppers, Garlic, Chili and Fresh Basil.
This was a sampling that my son's fiancee obligingly gave me to try.
A very delicious Stir-Fry with Ground Beef.
I will try this next time... whenever that may be.
Wait-Staff was very friendly, helpful.
I asked the waitress how the smallish chain came to be named Archi's... She said Archi was the nickname of the owner, who started his restaurants seven years ago.
This location started up two years ago taking over a Pick-Up-Stix franchise that went bust.
She also said the owner usually is at the Rainbow location ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/archis-thai-kitchen-and-thai-bistro-las-vegas ) since that was the original restaurant and is quite larger in size.
One other advantage of this location is the proximity to my favorite Cinema in Las Vegas... the Regal Village Square 18 ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/regal-village-square-18-las-vegas ).
Archi's would be a good pre or post movie visit.
BTW, Archi's has been rated the Best of Las Vegas 2005-2007.

Good chicken Tom Kha--great broth and the chicken had little to no fat, but it had that stale chicken flavor that I hate...the tinge smell--that almost ruined it but great broth!
The pad seayou chicken was great--- so so good!
It was better than the beef by far!
Generous portion of Thai iced teas, and clean and good service.
I will be back--hopefully often but I am always scared of chicken that's of fresh.

We've been going to the Archi's locations for awhile a couple years now and like in any location that we go to, I usually stick to our "usual" (Tom You Shrimp w/ white rice & calamari) because I have a fear called-- disappointment and I hate it.
But I've been trying to get over my fears and one day we decided to venture outside of the usual.
Our newest discovery was the Papaya Salad.
Shredded Papaya with a sweet chili flavor type sauce and leaves of lettuce.
My husband loves spicy food, so he gets (from a scale of 1-10) a 6, as for me, I am a fricking wimp when it comes to heat in my food so, I usually have a few bites and eat the crap out of the lettuce since it's mostly water and it's super refreshing!
Other than the Papaya Salad, the food is like any other Thai restaurant and can assist with any fix that you're looking to get for Thai food.
The thing that differentiates Archi's from other Thai restaurant is the fact that they pay attention to detail through service and presentation.
Pure white plates and carved garnishes are usually small indicators that they care about- presentation.
The decor of the restaurant is very modernized.
Walking towards Archi's the first time, you'd assume that the place was as plain as the exterior of the restaurant... Not at all true.
Boo!
No refills on Thai Ice Tea!!
Some restaurants refill, some don't and Archi's does not.
That's the only reason why I knocked one star off.

Great lunch specials.
Nice location.
Red curry is tasty good, Thai-Tea is classic.

pretty good place.
my father would rate this place a four star, he is here every moment that he can get to eat.
i luv it because it is clean and it is good for family gathering.
If you get a chance to eat here and love seaqfood try as an entree the tom yum soup (sea food mix).
It will be good enough for four or more people to eat.
Also, most their plates can feed more than two.
check it out!!

So Archi's turned out to be a hidden gem after going there for the first time, I thought the food was decent but not spicy as I had ordered.
I LOVE spicy food- the hotter, the better.
I know most people think they like spicy food and when you give them a mildly hot dish they start crying like a baby.
Which is why I always order my dishes at the highest spice level a restaurant serves.
And so, my first visit to Archi's I did as such and was disappointed by the lack of heat.
I mentally crossed them off my checklist of my favorite Thai spots....  A month later I was craving Thai and Archi's is literally a block from my house so I gave them another try.
After the first 5 bites of food, I was breathing FIRE!!
I couldn't believe the extreme turn around of spiciness level and I absolutely loved it!
Archi's has now become one of my top favorite Thai places and I know I can count on them to live up to my expectations.
I work in a smoky bar and when I get home from work I usually feel sick to my stomach from breathing in second-hand smoke all day.
The Tom Yum with chicken (level 10) always does the trick to make me feel better or cure a hangover.
I also LOVE the Pad Pak w/chicken (lot's of delicious veggies with choice of meat), Garlic Pepper Chicken, and Red Curry.
The only think I don't care for is the Pad Thai at this place.
It's reddish orange for some reason....?

This place used to be really great prior to their expansion.
They are just ok.
The foods never persistent.
Different cooks, several locations = Avg quality.

I recommend the chicken pad thai, tom ka soup and yellow chicken curry.
The food is authentic and the service is ok!

Great Thai food!!!
Their curries and pad thai are among the best I have ever had!
Love that you can choose your own spiciness temperature for each dish, which many Thai restaurants don't offer!
They also have great Thai Ice Tea.
Great and convenient for take out!

They do a nice job.

I wanted to grab a bite to eat before seeing a late night movie next door.
We arrived around 8:30 pm so I thought whatever I get should be light.
Then I thought again ...I'll order a side of Pineapple Fried Rice just in case.
My husband ordered the Thai Beef Salad which has grilled top sirloin, tomatoes, red onion, cucumber, green onion, cilantro, and hand-tossed in spicy lime dressing .
That salad never lets me down..it always turns out really good.
I ventured away from my usual chicken curry dishes and wanted to also order a salad.
I chose the Papaya Salad that had sliced green papaya, tomatoes, green beans, peanuts, dried shrimp, and spicy lime dressing.
When I read it on the menu my eyes failed to see the dried shrimp.
I was picturing nice big juicy shrimps on top of that salad.
When they served it I thought "Maybe I forgot to mention the shrimp" ..because I couldn't see them.
I started eating the salad and my husband starts eating it too.
Then I tasted the little dried up shrimps which are smaller than the peanuts so they are barely noticeable.
I dare not say a word because my husband loathes mostly all seafood and he already ate half of of the dish!
It was a nice crunchy salad because of the papaya but I didn't mind.
If I were to get this again I would have them leave out the dried shrimp because I'm not a fan of it.
I also had my safe Pineapple Fried Rice which has Jasmine rice, stir fried with tomatoes, onion, green onion, pineapples, cashews, raisins, egg and cumin powder.
It's a nice melody of flavor that blends nicely together.
I had to stop myself from taking more than a few bites so I wrapped the rest of it for lunch for the next day.
We ended with the Mochi Ice Cream which comes with three flavors we chose Red Bean, Green Tea and Strawberry for my husband.
( He has a hard time trying new things) I always enjoy the ambiance here because it's relaxing and the food is delicious!

Im a fan for the food, not the service.
We got seated fairly quickly, however, it took about 5 minutes for someone to come to our table for the first time.
Eventually I ordered the Pad Thai lunch special with a #2 spice level.
(Spice levels range in 1-10, with 10 being the hottest) Which came with soup of the day, which our waitress neglected to inform us of, a wonton, an egg roll and of course the main dish.
When the soup arrived it was OK.
I asked the waitress what it was and she said coconut milk something or rather.
And thats all....while the broth was good, the ingredients werent.
There were thee brown hard circles, chicken, something that looked like lettuce or cabbage, green onions (I think) and carrots.
I wasnt impressed.
Then our main dish came out.
The Pad Thai was a little too spicy for my liking and way to peanuty.
I ended up only eating the wonton and egg roll and having to order a whole other meal.
That was annoying.
I ordered the fried rice in place of the Pad Thai and it was amazing.
Thats what I go to Archi's for in the first place.
The down side is I ended up paying basically $16.00 for fried rice due to me not liking my first order, they wouldnt take it off my bill.
In summary: I would go again, not during lunch, and play it safe with items ive ordered there before.

I am not really a Thai food enthusiast; however, my boyfriend is and I have heard great things about this place so I wanted to give it a try.
The place was very busy during lunch hour but we were immediately seated.
We both ordered $6.95 Lunch specials which is really a great deal of food for the price.
His red curry was fantastic!
My Kung Pao chicken was just ok. All the other food with the meal was delicious.
I will go back again but will stick with ordering curry.

love Thai food.
we tried this place one random night the husband was away for work.
las vegas is a large grid.
so going down one main exit street could take hours to find the end.
we just moved here so we drove down 215 and found an exit to travel down one such street and chance stumbling upon a restaraunt we wanted to eat at.
again, the streets can go on forever as ever.
we were almost to our own street [buffalo] so we had to decide fast..   we came upon a plaza that had a jollie bee, a fancy shmancy, a couple other things... and archi's thai cafe.
though I told the kids they could pick what they wanted, I came out the winner in this game.
again, I love Thai food.
theirs lots of parking..   the decor is very traditional thai and is a really good sized restaurant with lots of seating.
our waitress was friendly and though it was busy.. she never forgot about us.
the order:  appetizer- stuffed chicken..  [wow]  the kids loved it..  my son, who doesn't often venture from the norm,  loved  this dish a lot.
super good..  i had my usual yellow chicken curry mildly spiced and i they had an excellent curry..  won ton soup- the won tons were juicy and the broth flavorful.. the vegetables and slices meat slices were plentiful.
it definitely did not disappoint.
shrimp fried rice- comes with a lot!
it's tasty.
after trying archis for the first time..  i'm a fan!
will definitely try the one closer to our house.. not sure when i'll ever see this particular location again.. but if i were closer i'd probably be a regular!

Archi's is my current favorite Thai restaurant in town, and I have tried many including Thai Spice, Komol, Lotus of Siam, Thai BBQ, Pin Kaow, Marnee Thai, Promarres, King & I, Panna Thai, Tipps, and Basil 'n Lime.
This is their 3rd and newest location.
We usually get the Pad See-Ew, Pad Thai, Spicy Eggplant, and sometimes a Thai Iced Tea.
My wife also loves their Green Papaya Salad and enjoys their various curry dishes.
For the spicy dishes, they will ask you how spicy you want it on a scale of 0 to 10.
We usually go with "2" because their "3" can be extremely hot, as in sweat-inducing, nose running-like-a-river hot!
I can't even fathom what a "10" might be like.
Their prices are very reasonable except I do get annoyed when they charge you $1 for a small bowl of rice without letting you know ahead of time.
Pet peeve, I know.
What distinguishes this place from most other Thai restaurants (and the original location) is the warm, clean, and contemporary interior.
You feel like you are dining in an upscale restaurant instead of a hole-in-the-wall joint.
Service is typically friendly and efficient.
The combination of quality food at reasonable prices, solid service, upscale ambience, and as an added bonus its proximity to home make this our go to place for Thai.
Well done, Archi, well done.

I've been a regular here and always get the pad Thai or their curry dishes.
I wish I had know of yelp!
since I had my iPhone!

Pretty good Thai food.
I had the only curry that doesn't use a coconut milk base, I believe they called it "country style".
It was in a chicken broth.
The country style curry had a nice savory broth and plenty of heat (I ordered it hot).
The shrimp were plump and juicy.
I would have preferred more and different veggies.
The atmosphere was pretty nice and the service was good if a little rushed seeming.
Bottom line?
I'd go back but they're not high on my list of Thai places in Vegas.

Definitely deserves a 5 star rating!
My friends and I have been coming to the Archi's Thai Cafes for a few years now and we always order BIG family style!
If you're lucky to get Pete at one of the Archi's, he's a real cool guy!
We used to order the Catfish Delight until Pete highly recommended the Choo Chee Catfish at #3!
Soo good!
The mood is right for casual dining or if you'd like to have a good quiet dinner with a special person ;) Our friend is Thai and they said it's one of the best they've ever tasted!
Our usual order looks something like this: Tom Kha soup, Choo Chee catfish, Pad Kee Maw, Lard Na, Eggplant beef, and LOTS of steamed rice!
Hope you're prepared for some knockout food!
Sawadee ka and bon app√©tite!
(dang, three different languages?!

The service was horrible and the food was mediocre at best.
I waited 25 minutes after ordering for my bland portion of prik king to come out.
After eating, it took another 10 minutes for them to actually notice and bring over my bill.
Will not be returning.

I am a big fan of Thai food, so when I moved here, I saw a whole bunch of Thai Restaurants that didn't impress me much.
I happened to accidentally stumble upon Archi's Flamingo location by turning into that parking lot since i couldn't make a U-turn.
I decided to give it a go a week later with my auntie and I was impressed.
The atmosphere inside the restaurant is warm and inviting, something about it makes you feel like you belong there.
I dunno, it's weird.
I got there a little after lunch time started and it wasn't that busy.
I was greeted by two waitresses and they were very friendly.
The menu has a pretty good selection, and most dishes you have the choice of what type of meat (or shrimp) that you want.
I pretty much just looked for what I know, and ordered it up.
My auntie ordered the Pad Thai with Chicken, i ordered the Curry and we shared a plate of Papaya Salad.
YUMMY.
It was so good, the curry had a nice balance of spiciness and creaminess with a touch of sweetness.
The papaya salad was good too, when we ordered it they ask how spicy you want it.
Well, other places you go to, when you say spicy it's usually just mild.
HA HA.
No, not in this case, it was so spicy we had to take it to go and work on it another time!
:) But my favorite dish, till this day is the Pad Thai.
It has such a RICH flavor to it, and when you receive it, YOU mix the noodles, sprouts and peanuts yourself.
:)   So far, I'm liking it, I will be back hopefully next time to try out more dishes!

I never knew I'd love eating catfish orr curry.
I guess archi's has given me a reason to.
It's called chu-chi here and it has both curry and catfish in one dish.
I get it at level 7 cus I love the spices from Thai cuisine.
We always have celebrations here or sometimes just roll deep for no reason.
I'd say it's prolly the last great thing standing at village square, besides the movie theater next door.

Woohoo!
It's Friday night.
You know what that means.
Mommy's off kitchen duty.
;)  Time for takeout!
I had a craving for Thai so we turned to yelp for a recommendation.
We ordered the Tom Yum soup, Pad Thai, and Panang curry.
We ordered spicy level 5 for all three but the soup was spicier than a 5.
Maybe more like a 7-8.
The pad thai and panang curry were pretty good.
I wish the curry had more a bit more curry...didn't seem to have much liquid but I liked how it had green beans.
When we ordered they told us it'd be 30 minutes.
Hubby went to pick it up after 30 minutes and he still had to wait another 10-15 minutes.
While he was waiting he spoke to a few other patrons who were waiting to be seated/pick up their orders and many of them said they've often had to wait an additional 30 minutes to pick up their orders.
And he said the place was packed with maybe six tables worth of people waiting to be seated.
I guess dinner options in Summerlin are pretty limited.
I think the food is worthy of a 3.5.
I'm going to give it another try and reevaluate.

My first time coming here for a friends Bday and to think I've been tolerating and spending my time at Original Thai BBQ and not have known about Archi's this whole time.
Best Thai dish I've had in Vegas and service is great also.
Friend recommended the Chee Choo catfish in curry sauce.
Ordered medium spicy which was not at spicy at all but other than that it still had the right touch of flavor and the curry sauce was good.
But after trying out my friends spicy beef eggplant, it made me wish I ordered that instead.

I was looking for a Sprint store and remembered there being one near Ft Apache and Sahara, but I arrived too late and they were already closed.
So I decided to check out Rising Sun Sushi, which is supposedly located in the same strip mall (sign is still up), but after driving around the entire strip mall and not seeing any sign of Rising Sun and finding Archi's Thai Cafe next to the movie theater I decided to check out their dinner menu.
The restaurant itself looks nice, the dining area is split into 2 sections (at least), as I was directed to a corner table in the smaller more secluded dining section closest to the parking lot.
I was hoping to be seated in the main area, but whatever.
They have a few waitresses and 1 waiter, and I am not sure if they take turns in getting customers/tables, but I ended up with the waiter that still have a lot to learn about getting better at being a waitperson in a restaurant.
If the number of guestcheck holders in their apron is a direct count of the number of tables they are currently assigned, then I would say he has 3 tables to look after while I was there, and he was overwhelmed with just those 3 tables.
After I ordered and the food was served (by a different waitress), he did not come by to check up on the table until I was practically done eating, and it took forever (at least 5 minutes, but most likely not more than 10 minutes) to have him come by again to pick up the money.
This while at least 10 people were eying me sitting there waiting, while they wait for a table to be freed up so they can get seated and order some food.
Anyway, moving on to the food.
I have tried the curries before, and I thought about trying something new.
Sukiyaki (Thai Style) was what i ended up ordering, and I was thinking a Japanese Sukiyaki with Thai ingredients.
Completely wrong imagery!
What I ended up with was a bowl of Thai noodle soup that I remember eating at one of the street food vendors when I was a kid in Bangkok.
The flavor was the same as what I vaguely remembered.
It was served piping hot (good), with lots of vegetables (sure why not), a lot of pieces of chicken and 2 shrimps, plus a side of chili paste (cool, you can adjust how spicy you want).
But still I thought that item was overpriced for what it really is, and I will not order it again.
The Thai Iced Coffee is still large, and I think is worth the price of admission, and still very enjoyable.
I sometimes feel like just ordering that to go, if I am too lazy to shop at one of the Asian supermarket that sells them premade in cans or as a mix.
Overall: Service: 2/5 Food: 3.3/5 Price: 2/5 (For their Sukiyaki - Thai Style) Atmosphere: 4/5  This location is not recommended if you want to try Archi's and staying on the Strip, as their W. Flamingo location would be closer, and my experiences there have always been a good one.
But if you live near this location, by all means drop by and try any of their curries.

Archi's is by far my  favorite Thai restaurant in Vegas.
I've been coming here with friends for the past couple years now and the food here is to die for.
You can get your food however spicy you want it ranging in a scale of 1-10 of how spicy you want it.
I've always left this place with a smile.
They have great service and three convenient location here in Las Vegas.
Definitely a place to go for some good Thai eats.

3 words: YELLOW CHICKEN CURRY.
The curry is not a paste thick sort but rather a mixture of  sweet and spicy yumness!
The spices in this dish are not overwhelming at all and they provide a taste like no other.
Like most curry dishes you have to choose a spicy range from 1 to 10.
I love spicy food and let me tell ya, 7 is pushing it but I've tried 8 and while it is very spicy, you can still taste well enough to enjoy the dish.
So far everything I've tried has been delicious from Pork Phad Thai to their Tofu soup to Tom Kha Shrimp.
If I had anything bad to say about Archi's it would be that their fried rice is mediocre, I've most definitely had better fried rice before, but its not terrible- just bland.
Make sure to try the Thai Tea with your meal- DELICIOUS!
:)  For some reason this location is hidden away like some redheaded step child.
Its a tiny location in the Village Square shopping center, but once you find it and go inside you will find a warm and friendly environment.
This location is always clean and ready to serve.
The staff is so friendly- I once picked up some take out and  the waitress offered me a drink  while I waited (which wasn't long).

Lots of times when people say they like Thai food that sometimes means their talking about the Pad Thai.
lol I'm one of them~ Anyways I love coming here EVERYTIME I eat here I am satisfied and happy.
Service-excellent fill up my drink all the time and food comes out fast food- oh yes.
hmm....spicy eggplant.
yes try it.
try try try.
any food that comes out of their kitchen is the bomb.
It might be a illogical fallacy but whatevs.
Archis make good food all the time ;deal with it

We love Thai Food and Archi's is where we go for our fix.
It's definitely spicy though so those of you who think you can handle the 5 may want to rethink it if you want to taste your food.
I'm typically a 5 but usually go with a 3 here.
Just the right amount of hot.

Archi's always delivers!
This was my first time at this location and I gotta say I like the other locations better.
This one is much bigger (read- more busy/crowded) and the service left something to be desired.
But once we dropped a hint the main guy, things went alot more smoothly.
HIGHLY recommend the red curry and the papaya salad.
Just a warning the salad was WAAY spicier than I expected, so be conserved on the level you ask for.
Also got the flat noodles with chicken- pretty solid.
I highly recommend Archi's to anyone and everyone!

After reading all the raves about how good this place was I decided to try it.
This place is the epitome of American style Thai food.
Why ?
Well , for starters, the chicken satay is dark meat and fried.
Need I say more ?
In fact , I think it was twice fried because it was like eating leather.
I've had satay in about 20 different places....always grilled white meat.
I could go on and rip this place to hell, but why bother ?
With a name like Archi's no doubt Jughead is running this place....

One of the Best Thai Restaurants in town.
Let me start off by saying I have been to all of the Archies locations and this is by far the best and most consistent.
The interior is beautiful and the wait staff is very friendly.
But if your like me and order take-out then prepare to suffer through ordering because one of the kitchen staff normally answers the phone and lets just say Ixnay on the English.
But for the quality and price of the food you cannot beat it.
I normally order the Chicken Satay and to be honest there have been times when this has been overcooked.
But only when I phone in an order.
And I can honestly say it's only been twice in 30 some odd visits.
The peanut sauce is my favorite out of all the Thai places I've tried.
Also on the appetizer front is Beef Jerky which comes with a light citrus sauce.
I dont care for Thai Jerky on a norm but theirs is good.
For the entr√©e my norm is Pad Ka Pow (Spicy Basil) Beef.
It is ground beef in a spicy chili basil sauce with sliced bell pepper and zucchini.
Seriously, it is without a doubt my favorite dish of theirs.
The meat is so spicy and flavorful.
It always clears the sinuses.
If I'm not feeling Ka Pow on a certain night than I get Pad Thai.
Their Pad Thai has a fresh taste to it.
And while I enjoy shrimp Pad Thai; theirs while being good had the tails intact which is a pain in the keester.
So I would suggest getting the chicken version of the dish.
I have had other various entr√©es that are equal in quality and flavor.
And love trying new dishes when ever I need a change.
And finally dessert.
They feature a plate of sticky rice with fresh fruit which is amazing.
It's a bit pricey ringing in at $7 but I think it is worth it for the amount of yummy goodness you get.
And it is easily big enough for two people.
So take a chance and try this place.
As I have said it's the best Archies in town.
Happy Eating, Jace

My friend Susan is always draggin me around to try new things..
I was a little hesitant to try it... but she was driving .
We sat down and ordered.
I ordered Pad Thai and She ordered Pineapple fried rice.
Then we did what our Momma's taught us and Shared our dinners with each other.
Truly good food.
I was very impressed with the textures and flavors of the pineapple fried rice.
the Pad Thai was not overly hot, and was pleasant on the palate Definitely gets added to the MUST TRY AGAIN list.

My third favorite of the three Archi's locations around town.
It's the farthest from me, so therefor the one I frequent least.
All my same favorite dishes apply to this location.
Curries, noodles, soups and eggplant are always my favorite.
I still steer clear of the chicken dishes.
Pork, tofu, catfish and shrimp are the way to go usually.
My Thai obsession knows know boundaries and Archi's (all locations) is always there to feed the addiction.
Cheap, clean, good service and food.
That's all I ask for in a great restaurant and Archi's delivers every time.
I don't order drinks here either.
I hate having to pay for refills.
Only my favorite Archi's on Rainbow has a fountain.
Good for the location and especially right before or after the movies.

High quality, VERY authentic (I lived in Thailand 2+ years), great atmosphere and wait staff.
The only reason I give this a four instead of five is that the menu is a little shallow and uninspired

Very cheap authentic Thai in a nicely appointed dining room.
I liked the spicy basil beef.
They also have a great coconut soup with shrimp.
Definitely home made and tasty.
Go as spicy as you can handle or keep it mild!
Gooood Food!

My favoriteThai restaurant in Summerlin area .Price reasonable, clean,service fair.
I love Pad se ew, beef with broccoli, thai tea and pad thai.

Came in for lunch.
Such a cute place.soft instrumental music playing.
Clean big comfy chairs, but the food took a while.
The service was poor, but I enjoyed their food.

Awesome service.
Awesome location.
Solid atmosphere.
Excellent food!
Been here for lunch and for dinner and it rocked both times.
All very very good: Red Curry Chicken, Spicy Basil (both Beef and Chicken) and Pad Thai.
Fresh spring rolls are just so-so but thats not because of Archi's.. they are always just so-so anywhere.
Hot rating runs a little hot from my experience... a 4 here is like a 6 at other places but its still super good.
Don't miss this place, the great food or the great service.

Pyaar Indian Restaurant a few stores down...Y U WEBSITE SAY U HAVE BUFFET MONDAY BUT U NO OPEN MONDAY?!?!
Maybe it was for the best...Original plan was to hit up Pyaar for indian buffet and get some spice and flavor on.
Too bad it was closed but this couldnt have worked out better as a vast majority of people leaving their parked cars were migrating toward Archi's.
Shapow man ordered a beef salad which came real quick.
My red curry lunch special took it's sweet time but what lacked in readily available made up in mmmm mmmm good.
The soup that is included with the lunch special was kind of a thai american fusion.
It was chicken soup but was thickened and egg dropped.
Thick cuts of onion, carrot slivers, and celery with decent sized slices of chicken white meat.
I was overall impressed with the red curry.
Medium wasnt quite as spicy as i was expecting ordering a medium but it had a very pleasant creaminess from the coconut milk.
Lots of bamboo shoots which i love.
Salad was perfectly dressed with a thickened fish sauce (i think) based dressing.
Overall everything on that plate was friggin good.
Total damage done between an order of the red curry lunch special, a beef salad, and a cranberry juice: 21.49  Wait....what?
the total damage rung up to twenty one fiddy??
Oh hells no i'm bout to come back a few more times.

Not lotus of siam, but it'll do for the west side

Archi's is THE BEST Thai Food in Las Vegas.
Honestly it might be the best I've had anywhere.
The Sahara location is jsut as nice as all the others, and a little less crowded.
Do yourself a favor and go here as often as possible!

Delicious food at reasonable prices has my family coming back over and over again.
I usually order the massaman and thai iced tea.
They do charge $1.50 for extra rice, which perplexes me because they expexct three adults to share one scoop of rice, but whatevs.
The service is fast, even when it is busy.

Great place.
The food here is wonderful at a great price.
The only Thai in summerlin with a 4 star in my book

Good food, reasonable prices and clean, almost swanky atmo.
I had papaya salad, tofu panang and some kind of delicious coconut soup...I ordered it a 7 on the spiciness scale of 1-10, and it was perfect.
I would definitely come here again...

This place is AMAZING, to say the least.
I've been looking for amazing Thai food, and thanks to some friends, I found it.
We ordered about 7 different dishes, and they were ALL delicious.
You will definitely find me here.

Yummy!!!
Had the panang curry and pad ke mao noodles 7/10 spicy and they made it vegetarian for us!
Delicious found a fav by the house.

we eat here once a week with our three kids best larb chicken salid on the planet

i wasnt as impressed as i thought i would be.
The food was good but i think I was expecting more based on the great reviews.
I didn't care for the fresh spring roll, it was not like any other fresh spring rolls I've ever had.
It was more like a sausage roll with some veggies and glass noodles rolled in a dough.
The silver noodle salad medium spicy was good.

My go-to place for thai food :) Although it's kinda far from my house, I still like to come here whenever I want thai food.
I have tried green, red, and panang curry, pad thai, pad kee mao, pad see ew, tom yum kong, pineapple fried rice.
All of them are amazingly good.
The portion is pretty decent for the price too.
Service is decent, the waiter/waitress always have a smile on their face, which is a good thing.
Definitely worth a try :)

I have been a fan of this place for about 4 years.
I finally got my husband to eat here and he is hooked!
We both love the pad Thai which is super yummy.
I also really like the Yellow curry with sticky rice.
If you enjoy spicy foods this is your place cause they don't mess around when it comes to spicy!

Tried Archies cafe for the first time.
The service was great and the food was the best Tai food I've had so far.
I ordered the Pad Tai 6 on the spicey scale and it could have been a little hotter.
It is a great atmosphere and overall a great restaurant.

I love Thai food!
There are Thai places that I like one item here or there more than Archi's, but there is not a Thai place I can find that has a better overall menu.
They have my favorite pad kee mao (sometimes called drunken noodles) here.
In addition to the food, the service is always great at all of their locations.

They got the best food out of all the Archie's I been in but their servers don't really check on customers when they get busy.
I see them standing around a lot making the orders come out slow.
And some servers only get nice when its time to pay the check and determining how much tips to give them.
BUT other than that, service is okay, food is amazing especially their PAD THAI.

So, I'm pretty much ALWAYS in the neighborhood/general vicinity of this place, it's also been there for close to four years and yet as a lover a Thai food I STILL haven't tried this place?
I hit up Buldogi's, Jollibee and Pyaar (R.I.P.
) long before I even bothered to check this place out.
Could it be living across the street from Basil n' Lime?
I really don't know.
So I finally did check the place out.
What a wise decision.
:)  This may seem a little underwhelming to some because I had Pad Thai.
I know, I know, too "Americanized," but that's the very dish that eased me into trying and loving Thai food, and to this day I feel the only way l I can trust a Thai restaurant is if they do Pad Thai right.
Anyways, on to how I felt about the Pad Thai.
It came out in a HUGE plate, and they don't skimp on the meat (a very good thing since Basil n' Lime is starting to get skimpy with the meat in their Pad Thai).
It was fresh, and of course it would be ridiculous to expect Pad Thai to not be greasy at all, but the grease was at a minimum, which was great.
No groggy, increased blood pressure feeling afterward.
The only issue I had with the pad thai was a few too many glass noodles, they really could have cut back on that (and looking at other plates around the restaurant it seems like they smother EVERYTHING in glass noodles) In addition to the Pad Thai, I also had the Thai spring rolls.
These definitely could have used a little more seasoning, but they were fine when dipped in the sweet chili sauce on the side.
The service wasn't very attentive unfortunately, I had to flag people down for pretty much everything, and the fact that the restaurant wasn't even that crowded made it even weirder.
The dining floor is very nice though.
Small but cozy feeling, not cramped.
The ambiance is also in a sort of middle ground between casual and formal.
The decor was also very in character (with the exception of the small Budda (not Buddha) statue on the front table....wtf?).
The chairs were uncomfortable though, just saying.
My bill came out to be about $13.
At B n' L, it would be almost $16 or $17 for a similar meal, so that's one pro Archi's has over them.
THE FINAL VERDICT:  Pros: Fresh food.
Reasonably priced.
They didn't screw up the pad thai, a good enough pro in of itself.
Cons: Iffy service.
Too many glass noodles in everything.
Uncomfortable chairs, so it's probably better to do take-out.
The wtf?
: Is the fat Buddha (appropriately known as Budai) apart of Thai culture at all?
Suggestions: Be more conservative with the glass noodles.
You only need a little bit of them for some crunch in the food, since they don't have much of a flavor on their own.
Will I return?
I'm really not sure.

I will never ever ever eat here again for as long as I live!!!!!!!
My brothers thought it'd be a good idea to take me here for dinner since I lived in AZ and there is no thai restaurants in my town.
They had been here before and said it was really good.
But OMG it was a big mistake.
about an hour after we ate here we just started vomiting and we got severe diarrhea that lasted for 3 straight days.
I mean it was non stop, so severe in fact that on the first night I slept on the bathroom floor next to the toilet.
I know it was this food that made us very ill....
This is why I don't recommend this restaurant to anyone, cuz I have nothing good to say about it.
Even our waitress was so rude that night.
"EAT HERE AT YOUR OWN RISK."....
This place traumatized me so, that i'm afraid of going to eat thai food.
This place SUCKED!!!!

What a great restaurant.
The food was delicious and so very reasonably priced.
We had pineapple curry with pork, pad prik king (spicy green beans) with chicken, vegatable chow mein, white and brown rice.
We each had two beers and the check was a very reasonable $53 with tax.
Plus there was enough left over for lunch one day this week.
The service was right on target, the food hot and delicious.
What more could one ask for?
Really great meal.

2 visits, 2 stars.
OK, so for the good and the not-so-good:  I had eaten here for a late lunch and had the Tom Yum / Shrimp Seafood soup and hot tea.
I liked that you can control the spice level of the soup from 1 - 10.
The soup tasted very good, and very fresh too.
I left feeling very satisfied.
And, I liked the decorum and presentation of the place.
Its location is very convenient, near Summerlin right by the movie theater.
I liked this place enough, that I decided to head back several days later for another lunch.
I wanted to try one of their salads.
Before I ordered, I went to the restroom.
A worker from the kitchen was using the restroom at the same time, and I noticed that he did not  seem to wash his hands after.
While it is possible he might have washed his hands in the kitchen after he left, it is certainly not something I wish to speculate about nor think about when eating.
I would have said something to the waitress, but she was busy.
I ended up leaving without ordering anything, and it is highly unlikely I will ever return.

Oh Archi's.
What has happened to ye?
I used to love and frequent this place often, but then went through a phase where I just wasn't feeling the Thai vibe.
Recently, though, I got a craving for some red curry.
I could just taste that flavorful goodness as we drove down to the restaurant.
My husband was excited about the Pad Kea Mow.
Unfortunately, I was disappointed in my grand comeback to this former go-to spot of mine.
- The service was terrible.
We waited almost 20 minutes for someone to come and take our order.
I felt so bad for the couple next to us, hidden in a corner.
The staff completely forgot about them back there and the husband had to go ask the hostess TWICE to send over a waiter.
Maybe it's because it was a Monday holiday (President's Day) and they didn't expect such a big crowd?
- The prices had increased.
One of the things I loved about Archi's was their price point.
It's still moderately priced, but it was still disappointing to see the increase.
- My beloved curry (spiciness level 3) was over spiced and over powering.
The beef was overcooked and tough.
The Pad Kea Mow (also a level 3), on the other hand, was bland and had no spice to it!
Ohhhhhh Archi's.
Of course I'll come back and try again because I love you so much, but I really hope this isn't the end of our relationship.

Spicy Basil, always amazing.
Their tofu was cooked well, which is hard to come by and they didn't skimp on the zucchini (huge plus).
I like really spicy thai food, but my friend ordered this dish mild and it was still super delicious with a good amount of spice.

My absolute favorite Thai in Las Vegas.
The Pad Thai at Archi's is excellent.
It almost has a buttery quality to it.
This is one of the spots I always take friends or out of towners and they are always pleasantly surprised.
You will be happy at any of the three Archi's locations.
The Ft. Apache and South Rainbow locations are newer and nicely decorated.
The original spot on Jones and Flamingo is tiny and old but tasty as ever.
Lunch specials are great.
I usually teeter between my favorites, the spicy basil beef, and the pad thai.
Other delicious items on the menu: papaya salad, spicy eggplant, mango with sicky rice, thai iced coffee.
They offer brown rice - always a nice option.
Prices are right, food is delicious.
Archi's is a 5 star Thai experience.

I always like going to Archi's.
Nice folks and good place to get consistently good quality Thai food.
This location has a nice ambience and hasn't been too horribly crowded when I've been.
Get the stuffed chicken wings.
Best in town.
Lately, we've just been getting food to go.
Last time we just walked in and ordered and got our food in 10 minutes.
Awesome!
Spice levels are from 1-5.
3 isn't really spicy at all so if you want spicy, go for a 4 or 5.
In my experience, this restaurant doesn't do crazy Thai spicy and they have been pretty conservative with the spice, at least with us.

Horrible service.
The waitress forgot to place my friend's order.
When we asked to have her food removed from the bill, the manager argued with us and tried to say her food was not forgotten, just late.
Even though it took us flagging down a different server to have him put her food in to the cook.
Never again.

I like Archi's pad thai and pad see ew...especially because they use chinese broccoli.
The south rainbow location is good too.

Best Pad Thai in town!
I LOVE THIS PLACE

I love thai food and usually stick with Pin Kaow 3, but I had spotted Archi's Thai Cafe (during multiple trips to Bachi Burger...shh don't judge) and made a mental note to try it soon.
I'm glad I did!
Came here for a late lunch with friends.
There were a handful of other people in the restaurant.
Service was ok, the waitresses were mostly attentive but there were long gaps between water refills.
Other than that, the waitresses were nice.
What really made me happy I tried Archi's Cafe was that their spice level is actually SPICY!
Their scale is 1-10 (like Pin Kaow and other thai restaurants) but ordering a 9 here, felt like a real level 9!
It was spicy, my lips were on fire halfway through my plate of veggie pad thai and I was in heaven.
I consistently order spicy level 10 at other thai restaurants and it's hot but not truly spicy.
Archi's did that for me.

I am Thai and l love the food here.
Pad Kapow Beef and chicken Panang are my favorite.
I got my in-laws hooked on these dishes.
Then l'd brought my cousin who just came to visit from Thailand and she even said how awesome the food here was!

Friend and I ate here for lunch on a weekend in June.
I had the pad thai which I usually get at a Thai restaurant I've never been to before since pad thai is my benchmark of the eatery's cooking.
It was ok.
Restaurant decor was nice and service friendly.
This was the second Archi's restaurant I've tried and I think I'll stick with the single store, mom & pop Thai eateries.
Actually, we only ate at this Archi's because the line to Bachi Burger was too long.
I would rate this Archi's 4-stars had I been there for a weekday lunch special.
As it was, with it's weekend menu pricing, the place was ok.

One of my favorite Thai places in town.
Whenever I am on the west side of town craving Thai food, this is where I go.
I feel like it used to be cheaper then it is now, which was part of the reason I loved it so much.

I have been to Thailand and eaten at many Thai places in Vegas.
Archies is not my favorite, but its not far behind.
For a quick lunch, it may be the best via lunch combos.
Yes its a chain, but Archies keeps the food very authentic in my opinion.
Lunch combo is $7.95 and comes with a full soup, wanton, egg roll and entree.
My GF and I usually split it as its to bog for one person.
The Thai Basil rocks as does the PadThai.
There Thai Tea is excellent as well.
NO WIFI!
I go here for lunch break and sometimes i need WIFI to make it a working lunch and keep me out of the office.
That sucks but I guess they dont want people hanging around after they finish their food.

I've eaten here twice with friends & I always let them order because I'm no Thai food expert, but I know when stuff is tasty, and Archi's serves up some tasty food!
I used to frequent the movie theater next door when I was a teenage hoodlum and remember when this place used to be some really crappy Americanized Chinese food place that always smelled like crappy Chinese food.
I was really surprised it was the same place considering how cute & Thai-like the inside looked!
We've sampled their yellow curry, panang curry, beef and basil, pineapple fried rice, pad thai, pad kea mao, and papaya salad.
My favorite is the panang curry!
Omgosh, it was so delish, until I went home and checked out the calorie content.
Panang curry typically has about 40-50g's of fat for one serving.
Ouch!
Well, anything with that much fat better be worth it, and I'd say that one serving of panang curry is worth it.
Their pad thai is on the greasy side and kind of bland when you think about what's in it.
I definitely prefer the pad kea mao because it has more veggies and tastes like basil (yum!!!
)  compared to what you'd get in pad thai with just bean sprouts & peanuts.
I did not enjoy the papaya salad.
It was my first time trying it, but for $10, you get a "salad" that has a grated green papaya and this "dressing" that just tasted like fish sauce?
Did they give us the wrong sauce?
I don't know.
Regardless, I will be back to Archi's!
It has a cute ambiance with some delicious options.
Definitely try the panang curry & pad kea mao!

friendly service, great soups!

I LOVE Thia Beef Salad, so my wife wanted to go somewhere nearby.
This is the closest place to my home.
(So this isn't my first time here) None the less this 2 star rating was well earned, as I write this I am thinking one star.
To start off, this is one of the few locations in town that charge you for refills.
2nd, FAT should not be part of a salad.
I had to tear apart the meat from the FAT using a spoon and fork.
3rd, we shouldn't have to ask three times for Water or Napkins.
I mainly disappointed in the fact that my Hamburger I had earlier today had more lettuce than this Thia Beef Salad.
Is there a shortage on lettuce I don't know about???
This being the 4 valid concern, I am changing from 2 stars to a more deserved 1 star.
I hope this was a fluke and they return to there ways, of better customer service.

I like Archi's but it's not the best.
It is nice that they opened up a decent Thai Place in Summerlin.
But the selection (veggie), is a bit small and run of the mill.
The atmosphere is nice, the service is good and the food is tasty, but something is just missing.
I will go back because it's close to my parents, but I still prefer lotus of Siam.

I tried to kill my wife the other day.
I know what you're thinking, " I thought he loved his wife!
", and I do.
It's just every once in awhile we attempt to navigate our way through an Asian menu knowing full well she's deathly allergic to shellfish.
You know, all the good stuff, lobster ( seizure ), crab ( hives ), oysters ( seizure AND shock ), shrimp ( swelling ), and sea urchin roe ( sounds like I'm married to Barry White ).
So it was an anniversary and I thought, Hey, why not celebrate by going to Archi's and giving them a try.
If we tell them she's highly allergic they can accommodate, right?
Well, the answer is apparently, NO!
We did tell them, and the maitre'D was very helpful.
but unfortunately the guys in back aren't aware of cross contamination.
But you're here for the food, so...
The Spring Rolls were weird.
They had no translucent wrapping to them, They were more like a thick egg roll wrap.
Not delicate at all.
More like an Asian rawhide bone.
Flavor was a bit weak as well.
And wouldn't you know it, it had something in the sauce that started to tickle her throat.
We did get warned that the Sweet n Sour Pork had Oyster sauce, as is common in seemingly most of the dishes, so I had that one solo.
This was actually very nice, with the pork tender and the veggies snappy.
A strong dish.
The Pad Thai with chicken ( which was ordered at a three, was actually more like six or seven.
Oh, and she's allergic to hot peppers as well.
Go figure ) was chewy, the noodles were chewy, and the overall impression was chewy.
At one point in our meal, my wife politely rose ( actually bolted ) to the restroom and came back looking drained, feeling thinner, sounding like Barry White, and resembling a pink Stay Puff Marshmallow man.
Evidentally, what goes down, sometimes comes back up.
A bit of history here, on our first date, trying to impress her, I ordered Thai toast ( the one with shrimp, of course ) and nearly took her out then.
I forgot to mention the time I took her to Mimi's and instead of not serving Avocado ( yes, she's allergic to that, too.
) they wiped it off the salad and nearly ended her dining career.
They never apologized, admitted guilt, or anything.
Bastards.
Needless to say, as much as I love Asian foods, Sashimi, and the like, I love my wife even more, and there won't be many reviews of this nature.
P. S. She did survive and is laughing about it even now.
But I think she mumbled something about I owe her a car or something.
I'll find out later.
That's my story and I'm sticking to it.
Archi's is OK, not great, but acceptable.
My wife on the other hand is a trooper.
And a keeper.
Lucky me.

I went there with my boyfriend and my best friend.
I ordered the pad Thai and it was delicious.
The portion was huge,  (for only me) so I ate half of it and took the rest home.
Prices are very affordable.
The  only thing I dislike was how long we waited for the food.
They also brought out my friends food first, which left her waiting another 10 mins or so until our food got there.
I really liked it but it didn't surpass my expectations.
The service was just okay, not too much attention was given like other restaurants.
I will most likely visit again but Pin Kaow is still my favorite Thai restaurant.
I would give it 3.5 stars!

Food is awesome service not that much!

Great lunch specials!

Archi's is an incredible place for good Thai food.
They have a wide selection of tofu dishes that I am able to choose from.
The food came out in a timely manner considering it was pretty packed for lunch.
I have only been to the Sahara and Fort Apache location, but the service there was great.
The lunch specials rock!
Red curry with tofu and brown rice!
Perfection!

Location wise is perfectly situated right by Regal Cinemas in Village Square!
Conveniently accessible for those hunger cures before of after a movie.
For those unfamiliar...Archi's Thai Cafe may seem like another Asian/American Fusion like PF Changs...or pick up stiX...but in fact when one takes a closer look, 100% Authentic Thai is clearly shown.
Try and behold for this is true.
Upon first walking in, the restaurant feels small, but the wooden shutters, and wooden tables and chairs balances this out and gives you a good feel of solidity to its decor.
This is not your usual Asian themed furniture but don't let this fool you, for the food is as good as it gets.
Waiters will take your order and ask you from a level of 1-10 how spicy you would like your food to be, and plenty enough to satisfy all types of taste buds and spice level to handle.
Tom Kha may not be for everyone but It is a great little soup starter like won ton soup for Chinese food.
Price could be cheaper, but the quantity of food is decent enough and good enough for the price.
I don't know if your typical person would go everyday, but nice to have once in a while.
Thai food is comparable to Pin Kaow or Lotus of Siam  Archi's is clean and food comes out at a respectable time frame.
A little advice tho, get there before 6pm or off times because after 6pm the restaurant starts to get busy and picks up a lot of customers...you may have a line out the door or wait.
Others must think it is good though to keep coming back for more.
Give it a try...It is pretty good.

Solid, I plan to go back when I'm nearby~

I've never had a bad experience here!
Food is good, reasonably priced and pretty quick.
They have all the standard Thai dishes, so if you're looking for a good Thai place, you will probably find the dish you're looking for.

Pad Thai with tofu was real good and flavorful.
Prices were very good.
It's one of the few restaurants in Vegas that doesn't feel designed for tourists or as an afterthought.

Just a quick and non critical warning.
The shopping center is under renovation and the parking situation is pretty hit and miss.
You will likely park on gravel and have to walk a bit till they get the lot fixed.
That having been said, this is a solid choice for delicious, well done authentic Thai food.
I've been here three times and all meals were first rate.
I have had the Pad Thai with tofu and once with chicken--8/10 hot level--both excellent.
My son swears by the sweet & sour chicken.
Pad Se Ew was excellent.
Service has been first rate here, and the lunch specials are well priced.
Will be back.

Delicious food, great service, quiet atmosphere...
This is our go-to place!

Archi's is my go to Thai place in Vegas!
Anything you get here is going to be delicious, no lie.
Some of my favorites are..  Panang Curry - I would definitely recommend this dish with tofu, it literally will melt in your mouth.
The tofu is slightly fried so the outside has some texture and it is served over white rice.
Sadly brown rice is an extra $2.
Pad Kea Mow - This dish is so satisfying and delicious.
Best Pad Kea Mow I have ever had.
Tom Yum Soup - Sometime I will get this as an light appetizer before my main entree, but  be careful they make this REALLY spicy so get a low number for spice.
Pad Thai - always a winner.
I also really like the red and green curries, pineapple fried rice, pad prik king, spicy basil and rad nar.
The service here is usually pretty good and the servers are attentive.
The prices are reasonable and the food is always delicious.
I can't get enough Archi's :)

I didn't even like Thai food until I started going here.
I wonder if they secretly add some kind of crack to this food because I crave it fortnightly.
Sooo good.
My favorite is the Pad Kapow (spicy basil), Pad Thai, and the chicken fried rice is the.best.ever.
It is seriously amazing.
Yes, I know that's a "boring" dish.
I order it for my kids and wind up eating whatever they don't finish.
It's even better the next day.
We usually get take out but the actual restaurant is wonderful.
I love the plantation shutters everywhere.
The staff is friendly, although not always fluent in English.
I love this place.
I hope they don't change their business model any time soon.

First time coming here with my cousin and husband and kids.
Very small place but the service was good and the menu had a good selection.
Love how they rate the level of spicy for you, although we got a 5-6 it was pretty spicy!
We loved it!
We couldn't finish everything and we has left overs!
Awesome!
Very authentic Thai Food!

I am very picky with my thai food and when I found this place I felt lucky!!
The food is so fresh and the pad tai noodles are amazing.
I would recommend this place to anyone who really wants good thai food.

Delicious!
I went here 4 times in 1 week.
LOL...can't get enough of their curries.

Ate here with my girlfriend this evening.
She had the Mongolian entree and I had the Pad Cha Cha Cha entree.
Both were excellent.
We've also eaten here once before and had no complaints that time either.
Service was prompt and friendly.
We'll definitely be back again.

Should definitely try the stuffed chicken wings !
The soup is very authentic.
Not overly sweetened like all the other Thai restaurants trying to make it tailor to customers other than Thai.
Very authentic I would say.

Best pad see ew and mint leaf/basil fried rice in town.
However the pad thai is not nearly as good as in Pin Kaow by a long shot.
Overall one of the better Thai restaurants in Las Vegas.
It is clean and easy to find and very convenient if you live in or near Summerlin.
One area of constructive criticism since I do eat here often with the family: I would say is the customer service needs to be improved drastically since this is the only area that has a lot of room for improvement since their food is very good.
It is not bad by any means, but they often appear disorganized.
Some servers are better than others.
Specifically, when lines start to form the given estimated times are more like guesses and substantially differ depending on who passing by at the front.
It appears that having a hostess at the front at all times (during the peak times) would be a quick fix.

Can't go wrong with the pinapple currie!
I never skip it when I go here.
I love the environment and the service is attentive, even though some can be stingy sometimes.
The prices are on the high side.
Have had desert here too and its really good.
Great thai food altogether.

Good place for lunch during the workday if you can risk taking a little over an hour at times.
They are usually pretty good at turning tables, but it seems towards the end of lunch they get a little tired and take longer.
The food is really good, I like the Pad Thai, eggrolls, and wonton soup.

As a lover of Masaman curry, I've been trying a lot of places to try and find the best one.
At around 10 dollars (including tax) I'd say their beef masaman curry is well worth the money.
It's definitely not the best.
My favorite so far would be Komol's (in Sahara) but this is a good alternative considering I live in Summerlin.
The reason I don't think theirs was as good was because the beef pieces were "sliced" (as opposed to chunks of beef like at Komol) and the potato wasn't cooked as thoroughly as I'd like (it was still kind of hard).
The service was subpar.

I was feeling ill last week, so I decided to get some soup and noodles to sustain my cold, and I tried this place out since I live down the street, and I was impressed!
the chicken soup and a variety of vegetables and had a good bite of spice to it which helped clear up my chest congestion and the chicken noodles especially tasty with carrots and lettuce chopped in it.
I'll be trying this place soon again with it being right next to the movie theater makes it even better.

Mine and my husbands default place for food.
I get the same thing every time and love it: spicey basil with chicken.

Pad Thai was a little salty and greasy... and they charged my friend $1.99 for extra rice !!!
Been coming here several times already and not been charged extra for additional servings of rice (which is the usual for Asian Restaurants)... Rice is like water to most Asians... should be free !

Eh, i honestly don't see what the hype is about.
Pad thai was mediocre to say the least-had no tofu, the noodles tasted of shrimp (never tasted that before) and it was spicy after i specifically said "no spice".
Service was below an "eh" but above "awful".
I asked for extra napkins and instead of responding he walks away so my friend asked if he heard me.
I waited to see what he would do before i said anything and he ended up walking to a station to get napkins...is it that difficult to say "sure" or "yes"?
Not the worst thai place but i will definitely be visiting OSHA in San Fran next month!

You can't beat great Thai food, and Archi's has just that.
When we first moved here it was one of the first places we ventured to and has remained a favorite.
Not only is it great tasting food, the service is also wonderful.
They are very welcoming, attentive and the food comes out pretty quickly.
I love their pan nang curry.
I tend to stick to that dish while my husband ventures out and loves everything he gets.
This is a great little, friendly place for quality food.
They are closed on Tuesdays....which is when I crave them the most!

Loved Archi's Thai Caf√©.
It was recommended by a friend in the area, and it didn't let us down.
We had basil chicken, yellow chicken curry, pad thai, & fried rice.
My 1 & 4 year old devoured the pad thai and fried rice...this may be a direct result of the amount of thai food I consumed while pregnant with both of them.
The basil chicken and yellow chicken curry have to be some of the best I have ever had.
With that said, I had 2 babes with me and the service was a little slow, and less than attentive.
They also put us in the very back corner, which felt a little like "they have kids keep them out of the main area.
" It took a long time to get drinks and have our order taken.
Oh well, we had the back to our selves and my kids got to sit on the long bench and were stoked!
We will be back!

Shrimp was a bit over cooked, and wasn't a a fan of buying a $2 canned soda without any refills.
Other than that the rest of my meal was ok. Only reason I would come back again is for the movie theatre next door.

Never been disappointed here--dinner and lunch specials always hot & fresh at a good price.
The fried tofu appetizers are crispy delights, their panang or red curry dishes are savory, the stuffed chicken wings amazing (how do they get so much stuffing in there?).
Servers are attentive and friendly.

Ok so I am from LA.
This is not LA thai...
It is very good.
We had the Tom Yum soup with shrimp...
Very nice.
We had the red curry.
Very nice...  Best I have had in Vegas...

Grub!
Starved for Thai food nearby and Archi's hit the spot!
Almost passed on it, since not feeling well...  but so happy Monkey gave it a shot.
Nice interior decor, patio and seating to wait for your take out order.
Called while on the way home and before taking Monkey's order, they made sure you were calling the correct location.
There are 3 locations around town.
Very important.
3 locations, same owner, same menu and confident same deliciousness.
Monkey do: PHAD SEE EW - Fantastic noodles & broccoli w/chicken - an old favorite dish MANGO STICKY RICE - Perfection!
Packed well to go & additional sweetness to go with, for you sweet teethed.
PO TAK(Tom Yum Seafood) soup - hit the spot, loaded with seafood FRESH SPRING ROLL - definitely shareable  Monkey will most definitely return!

Archi's on Sahara serves up very solid Thai food.
I live very close to this location and order takeout frequently, but I have eaten in the restaurant many times as well - I recommend both!
My favorite things on the menu are the pad see ew and tom kha ghai (chicken coconut soup).
I love the broth so much that I usually order extra broth and less of the soup contents.
Once it didn't work out so well - I got home to find that they had written "extra broc" on the top of the soup container and the entire soup was filled with broccoli!
:) Even though it wasn't what I wanted, it still scores them a point for doing anything a customer asks, even when broccoli isn't actually an ingredient in the soup!!
The curries, salads, and other appetizers are quite good too (except I've never been a huge fan of the spring rolls, which are normally my favorite thing at a thai place).
Prices are very reasonable and everyone is friendly.
Not the best thai in Las Vegas, but good enough to keep going back!

Best Pad Kea Mow in town if you ask me and the Basil Fried Rice is just too good.
I eat my meals here at spice level 9 or 10 and it has such flavor - but be warned some say the spicing is hot (not to me but I think something is broke with me - can't get it hot enough).
Friday's soup with lunch specials is a fantastic coconut chicken soup (Tom Kha  Also a must try is the Papaya Salad - great with a Thai beer.
And if you love Curry then get the red curry with chicken and buckle up.

I forgot how good Archi's is.
I tried once about a year and a half ago with family.
The Sahara location isn't anywhere near me but it was a good central spot for a family meet.
The staff is always friendly and welcoming.
I had the Thai tea to start.
It was very good.
Not too sweet and not too strong.
I love pad Thai and I love it HOT!
So when I ordered my chicken pad Thai at a 10 the waiter was surprised and confirmed the spice level.
He also confirmed that there was peanuts and egg in the dish.
I thought was a great idea for any food allergy people.
I've never had a restaurant do that.
I also got the Tom Kha soup.
Great flavor and the coconut milk made it a little creamy too.
The serving is enough for 2-3 people to split if you're ordering as an appetizer.

Fresh but very bland Thai food.
Pleasant but I would never come back.
Way too many choices out there.
Broccoli main entre had no taste.
Spring rolls very bland.
Ginger ginger tasted like soy and ginger.
Vegetables were fresh.
Dishes $10-$13 mid range for neighborhood fair.

Ordered to go two times so far and have been thoroughly satisfied both times.
I've visited a few other Thai places in the valley and have yet to found one worthwhile.
Sadly I think this is the first place I've been to that had somewhat fresh vegetables.
I think Archi's is "the one"!

Best Thai food in town!!
Amazing food and amazing prices.

This is good Thai-American style food.
Service is fast and good, prices are right and it is clean, and tidy.
We were a party of 3 and ordered 3 dishes to split.
All were good but the green beans and fried tofu with basil was very yummy.
They gave us an ample amount of rice and a hot sauce that was actually hot!
The spring roll was fresh and flavorful, but the brown sauce they served it with was uninspiring.
I prefer a more authentic taste of Thai, but this place is good.

This Thai restaurant is quite a ways from the Strip.
We had went to another restaurat before Archi's, but that restaurant had too long a waiting time.
So we decided to try this place instead.
Fortunately, we had no wait time.
There was one table just waiting for our party of 4.
The ambiance was relaxing, and the restaurant was nicely decorated.
Staff was attentive without being intrusive, and the food came out quickly.
So, this is what we ordered and shared.
Beef Pad see ew for $8.95, ginger ginger ginger chicken for $9.95, spicy chicken basil fried rice for $9.95, green curry chicken for $9.95, and Thai iced tea for $3.95.
Everything tasted fine.
Not outstanding, but above average.
Las Vegas has so many restaurants to choose from.
If I was in the area craving Thai food, I would certainly drop by here again.
If I was not in the area, then I would not come all the way here to eat.
Overall though, Archi's Thai Cafe is a good spot to eat.
If they were in my hometown, I'd rate them 4 stars.
In Vegas, though, because of all the choices out there....I can only give them 3 stars.

After having tried various Thai restaurants around Vegas we had finally arrived at Archi's.
Let me just say that we should have tried here first.
Ate the Panang Curry, fried tofu, and broccoli.
Way more than enough for two and much much better service than lotus of siam.
If you're in the mood for Thai then this is the place.

Fresh spring rolls and Satay chicken are good appetizers.
Pineapple curry combo was delicious.
Sweet and sour chicken is the same as anywhere else.

Huge portions, great tasting food, and very good service.
I will be back again.

If I have a Thai food craving and don't feel like driving to Lotus of Siam, Archi's satisfies the craving.
You're not gonna find out of this world dishes, but the kind of dishes that have become staples of Thai food found in America.
Service is always prompt and attentive and it's speedy when you're ordering takeout.

Service pathetic I had to actually get up to track down my server in the kitchen...pretty much speaks for itself.
..The food was decent..the experience was not.

Unlike the other Archi's Thai restaurants in Vegas, this one is very very close to my home.
This is a very dangerous thing!
I get, exclusively, the Chicken Panang Curry because it is delicious.
I use Archi's Panang Curry as my bar to which other Thai food is compared.
Pro-tip: they'll ask you if you want spicy level 1-10.
If you're a fan of spicy food, it actually goes to 30 (in increments of 5 after 10).
I get the 30.
It's good.
At the one on S. Rainbow a 30 is *incredibly* and inedibly hot for me.
Here, however, it's only *incredibly* hot, and thus edible.
Different Archi's have different levels once you venture into the land beyond the 1-10 scale.
Tread lightly.
Work your way up.

Whoa.
Their Thai iced coffee is gargantuan!
I forgot to look and see how much it cost but I could only finish about 1/4 of it and so the rest went to waste.
:( I also ordered a red curry with tofu and it was very good even though I only ate maybe 1/10 of it.
I liked the fact that the tofu was lightly fried which means less fat!
My friend Adam kept me well distracted and I totally forgot to eat my food.
Oops.
This place is casual, nice, clean and spacious.
It's right next to the movie theater so you can grab lunch or dinner before the movie.
I kind of wish we had more time so I could try the mango and sticky rice dessert.
This warrants a return trip in the near future!

Came here for dinner.
Geez, no one bothered to greet us, seat us or act like we existed.
Waited long enough & finally gave up & left.
Take your business & eat where they welcome customers.
These people could care less

Attempted to have dinner here, been to Archi's before for lunch many times at both locations.
Horrible service or just awfully mismanaged!
Waited 10+ minutes to be seated, wasn't ever even greeted (even speak some basic Thai).
We watched them setup a table for 2, our party was 3.
At that point we walked..not sure any of us will return.

I'm impressed!
This was some pretty good Thai food.
And my favorite part is that they have a spicy level that goes from 1-10.
I like my food on fire so of course, I ordered my food at a 10.
She told me it will be "very spicy.
"  After I did that, I was nervous for a minute.
Then, I got my food.
I got a Tom Yum Seafood soup at spice level 10.
Okay, it was hot and you could just smell the spice.
But for me, I think it was just right.
In fact, I think I could've handled it spicier.
And from reading the reviews below, it appears that the spice level may even go higher - to a 30?!?!?!
Perhaps I'll have to try a higher level next time.
But in any event... the food was good.
The only thing that I didn't like was the summer rolls, but that's only because I think in my head I was thinking of the Vietnamese summer rolls.
These particular rolls were actually wrapped in a flour tortilla and on the inside, it had Chinese sausage, veggies, and other stuff.
It was different.
It was good.
But it was just not what I expected.

I used to come here all the time, the Chicken Pad Thai was great, and the serving size was enough to feed two people for a fair price.
The other day I ordered take-out for lunch and they assumed I wanted some "special" they didn't even tell me was going on.
It's a dollar less, but a third of the serving size and it comes with a "free" wanton and spring roll.
The Pad Thai quality was mediocre at best, while the wanton had no filling, and the spring roll wasn't even cooked all the way.
I would have rather paid the extra dollar and gotten the full meal that I had ordered even with the mediocre Pad Thai.
I'm very disappointed in this restaurant's quality of food, maybe they changed owners or something, but I won't be going back.

Archis has vindicated themselves.
Today was a 180 degree turn around across the board.
I guess last time they had an off night.
My pops had the pad thai very tasty,solid.
I had the silver noodle soup with pork to start...the ingredients so fresh and tasty seriously one of the best soups I have ever had..anywhere!
I had the yellow curry with chicken also excellent.
I asked for 3 on the heat and omg it was spicey lol..be careful what level you ask for....service was outstanding and pleasant.
It is always a pleasure to write a great review....if they deserve it they get it and this place definitely showed that my first visit was a flook...without a doubt will return to this restaurant.

Our go to Thai restaurant .. Nice decor / great service / right next to the movie theatre.
They are closed one day of the week can't remember if it's tues or wed .. Great lunch special deal .
Fabulous soups and red curry

3-1/2 starts actually, but I'll give them the other 1/2 star for good service.
So far, the best Thai food that I've tasted in Las Vegas.
That probably doesn't say much, as I've only been to one other Thai restaurant.
Came here around 6:30p on a Friday night.
There was a little bit of a wait, (20 minutes), but no big deal.
Started off with the Satay Chicken - nice and tender, and able to cut with a fork.
I didn't really care too much for the Thai Egg Rolls, not that it was bad or anything, but it was just an ordinary egg roll.
It did taste a little better with the peanut sauce from the Satay Chicken.
Got the Larb (spicy sausage salad).
My dining partner insisted on a spiciness level of 8, then after tasting it, proceeded to complain how it was too spicy - Lol!
I liked it, but it was a little sparse on the salad part.
Pad Kea Mow w/ chicken seemed to be a popular dish, so, we got that one too - it didn't disappoint.
Even though those were the only dishes we ordered, there was enough leftover for lunch the next day.
Service was good - server kept our water glasses full and frequently checked to see if everything was ok. On my next trip here, will try one of the curries, the spicy eggplant, and possibly the stuffed chicken wings.

The name Archi's doesn't scream Thai cuisine or anything Asian for that matter, but once you get passed the unusual name, this place is definitely one of the better Thai restaurants in Las Vegas (chain or otherwise).
Tom yum soup is delicious here and you can really judge a Thai restaurant from the quality of this traditional Thai soup.
The Lunch specials they have from 11 a.m. - 3 p.m. are a very good deal and equally as scrumptious!
Overall the interior of the restaurant is very pleasant and appealing for what it is and the menu prices are very reasonable.
If you like Thai food you should stop by here sometime!

i was a little hesitant to try another thai restaurant in vegas because it felt like i was betraying LOS by doing so.
but my friends (both locals) were very convincing so we decided to finally try this place.
i'd have to say this is not a bad "other thai option" if one is craving thai food and don't have the time to wait (or was unable to make a reservation) at LOS.
the tom kha was good, the glass noodles (forgot the thai name) was one of the best noodle dishes i've had, the combination fried rice was well seasoned and could very well be a full meal on its own, and even the spicy basil pork was pretty tasty.
the only thing that was amiss at our table was the red curry.
it was like 3/4 bamboo shoots.
will never order that again.
i ordered spicy level 2 but next time i think i'll try a 3.   overall, this is a solid thai restaurant.

I've been coming here for years!
Thai Iced Tea, Pad Thai, Drunken Noodles, Satay, Green & Red Curries are some of the best I've ever had.
I love Thai Food & They definitely serve some of the best in Las Vegas.
My family has some vegetarian restrictions & they've always paid attention to our order.
Their customer service is hit or miss, but it's never been bad, just busy!
The prices are pretty reasonable as well!

By far the best Thai food in Las Vegas!
The Pad Thai is delicious the spice doesn't take away from the flavor of the dish like a lot of other places seem to do.
All of their curries are flavorful and well prepared.
Overall this place has great quality Thai cuisine.

I love Archi's   I highly recommend the seafood pancake!
I don't think they list this on their menu...
I'm not sure why but I heard about it from my mom and it is amazing!
Don't leave without having the sticky rice and coconut ice cream either ^.^   Only down side... the service was slow.
It was busy so I know it can get crazy trying to take care of all the tables but we didn't get a single refill and tried to flag the waitress down like three times before we were able to get her attention.

"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times", sums up our most recent visit to Archies.
"The best " was the food.
Pork Satay, Pad See ew and Pad Kea Mow are favorites and always perfect.
"The bad" was the service.
Usually its okay at best, but today they acted like we were interrupting them by showing up.
Every phase of customer contact was terrible, from the time we walked in and waited at host stand for 10 minutes just to get a grunt of an acknowledgment.
to the server who seemed almost angry with us.
Would have given 5 stars if service was good.
Will still go there, but no as often and will probably try other locations first.

Delicious!
Their walls are covered in awards, and every last one is well deserved.
I'd post a picture of my food, but I ate it too fast.
Highly recommend the pad see ew.
I've had it at a lot of Thai restaurants, and theirs is the best.
Lots of egg, wide noodles, and plenty of flavor!

Good food if u like it!
If u r new and don't the service on behalf of the management is HORRIBLE!!!
Pete the manager not only compared our experience to others on the sales item, but wouldn't be courteous enough to remove the item.
I have NEVER heard of the customer when dining having this matter.
I enjoy the food but because of treatment will NEVER eat here again!

Great food, Ok (not so great) service.
Strongly recommend.
This is probably the best  Thai food place in Vegas.

This would be a 5 star if for the food alone.
It would be a 4 star if the only issue was the fact that the rice portion that comes with the red curry was too small.
It became a three because the service we had wasn't very good.
I admit I will give it another try in the future as I think every place can have an off night for some patrons.

My go to spot for curry and pad thai in my neighborhood.
There are very few places that I visit on a consistent basis that make me as happy as a trip to Archi's does.
It is my guilty pleasure without the guilt.
Lets start off with my favorite dishes.
The yellow chicken curry is a balancing act of perfection.
A carnival of different flavors melded together to make one kickass curry.
Throw in some potatoes, onions, and carrots with whatever meat you desire and you have a hearty delicious meal on your hands.
Choose your desired spicy level, give me a side of rice, and I'm done!
Now the pad thai is easily one of the best pad thais I've ever had.
It is not some fancy rendition of pad thai with overcomplicated ingredients or an unnecessary presentation.
It's pad thai, with a side of chopped peanuts and baby sprouts.
That is it.
It does not need to be more than that.
I will say that not all dishes are created equal at Archi's.
Their fried rice is just not that well put together.
It looks delicious but it just really falls short on the flavor department.
And another shortcoming of Archi's is their inconsistant spice level.
I usually order a spicy level of seven but it will vary wildly from mouth scorcher to somewhat mild.
I think it depends on who is preparing it but make sure to keep that in mind when ordering.
Despite the complaints, Archi's still goes down in my book as a solid place to get some pad thai or curry.

Archie's is a Thai restaurant chain with locations convenient to both my work and home.
I love their lunch specials for the good portions and value.
I would recommend their Pad Thai lunch and Kung Pao chicken (better than Chinese kung pao).
They serve consistently good Thai food with my only complaint being the spice number is not consistent.
I've asked for spicy number 5s that may be more like a three on some days and like a nine on others.
Yikes!
But it's so good, I'll eat it anyway.
I would suggest not getting the salads or the soups too spicy because the spice tends to overwhelm these dishes.
Better to add more spice later than be sorry.
Besides the lunch specials,  a few other favorite dishes of mine are the Panang curry, Massaman curry and Tom Kha Gai soup.
If in season, try the mango and sticky rice for dessert.
Love it!

I have driven past this place for awhile now and finally decided to stop in, WHOA I have been missing out, this place is awesome.
We were greeted immediately and given a nice booth.
Our server was prompt, courteous and very informative.
We loved the food and will be back for sure

Great dining experience, wonderful service and excellent Thai food!
Highly recommended if you are looking for great Thai food that allows for spice accommodations from 1-10.

I have been searching for years to find great pad thai here in Summerlin.....Done!
I have yet to dine in but it looks really nice.
I do the pick up option and the portion is do big I can have half for lunch and the rest for dinner!
Not bad for $8.
Hoping to go in one of these days.

We are frequent diners at both of Archi's locations.
We use this one if we plan on seeing a movie.
Our experience today will make us never come to this location again.
We were seated promptly in their new section against the windows.
We waited for 5 minutes before someone even approached out table.
We ordered drinks and waited to have someone take our food order.
Another 5 minutes.
We didn't get anything crazy - 1 order of Thai egg rolls and 2 plates of Pad Thai.
This took a little longer than usual but they were busy so it was understandable.
However, we were only approached once for a refill and that's it.
When I say that's it, I mean WE HAD NO MORE SERVICE.
No one came to check on us again, no one asked if we needed to go boxes, no one asked if we were done and ready for our check.
I tried flagging down our waitress since we were trying to get to our movie to no avail.
Finally, my boyfriend left to purchase our tickets thinking I would be ready to go by the time he got back.
Nope.
He actually had to ask for our check and a box at the hostess stand.
What a horrible experience.
I felt bad for the people who got seated 2 tables down from us who had to wait 15 minutes to be approached.
However, the people who came in 10 minutes after us and ordered, ate, and left 10 minutes before us (ordering more food AND getting refills and checked up on) maybe you could give the rest of us some advice on how to handle this place.

This has the best Panang Curry I have ever tried.
I don't how they make it so much better than any of the other Thai places I've been to before.
Also, make sure you try their curry fried rice (make it spicy is even better).
You can't go wrong at eating here.

I ended up ordering the chicken Pad Thai which was ok. A bit on the dry side.
Also, it would have been nice if the server asked me if I wanted a lunch special or the full entr√©e.
A bit pricey for the quality of food.
I'd rather go to Corner Thai Kitchen.
Better food and better prices.

This is my favorite Thai restaurant in the whole city!
Due to its popularity there is usually a bit of a wait for dinner, so be prepared.
When we go we usually get the pad see ew, fried rice, pad won sen or any of the curries.
I'm not a big fan of their soups but everything else on the menu has not been a disappointment.

Thai food is "hit and miss", and this is a "hit".
This is not exotic, like Lotus of Siam, but it is good, and the portions are generous.
We have compared this place to other Thai places, and also fee that the ingredients are good quality.
We have tried many of the appetizers and our favorite is the the stuffed wing.
I suggest the Papaya Salad and the Panang Curry with Chicken.
I go with a spice level of 5 or 6.
My wife's favorite is the Spicy Basil, spice level 8, but she's Korean.
We have also tried the other noodle dishes, and have been very pleased.
I give them 4 stars, not 5 because the service is fair at best.
You will meet the whole staff being served.
One girl will take your order, another will bring you your food, another will refresh your water or iced tea, another will bring you your check.
Make all your requests at one time, or you may have to hunt down your server.
We find ourselves frequently yelling for a bus boy, which is not considered rude in the Thai Culture.
This place is located next to a Movie House, so I think it's perfect for Dinner and a Movie!!!
Settibello Pizza, Bachi Burger, 808 Hawaiian Tapas is also here.
Skip these places and go to Archi's.
Your taste buds and wallet will both thank you!!

Hands down the best Thai Restarunt in Las vegas, definitely worth checking out if u love Thai food, the portion sizes are good, great location, with great prices.
Customer services is good.
It can be better but I don't mind it because the food is execellente

Below average.
Use to be good, but now they just toss stuff together.
Too much spice ( turmeric) in one dish.
The other dish -papaya salad tasted a few days old.
I won't be returning.
Try Natalie Thai.

We were very eager to try this restaurant out after seeing how moist and saucy their noodle dishes looked in other yelper's pictures.
The reviews also seemed like this place wouldn't disappoint.
On Sunday night (Mother's Day) there was about an 8-10 minute wait, witch isn't bad at all.
By the time we were seated they quickly took our drink and our dinner order - so far so good right?
Then, they brought our drinks out.
What was a positive experience, slowly and annoyingly became a long drawn out waste of our time.
After 25 minutes of waiting for our food, I became drawn into and aware of the time - I was starving!
I saw that there were tables that were seated after us, receiving their food, I suppose it's because they were appetizers?
I couldn't tell.
I was still annoyed and very hungry.
I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food.
At this point I was very antsy, hungry, and aggravated.
My soda has watered down a lot at this point (I like to drink it fizzy with my meal).
45 minutes later, our food arrived.
We asked the server if they could be so understanding to swap out my coke for a fresh one, since I hadn't even drink it yet and it had gone flat since we waited so long for the food to come out.
The waiter didn't understand, he thought we wanted a coconut water - so he got the manager involved.
The manager listened to our concern and request, but he said that they don't do that here and that our request was unusual.
So we just had to say - ok thanks, never mind then.
It's just a simple coke - we were agitated about the extensive wait, my watered down coke that was clearly not drank from, but they weren't concerned about our complaints.
He was polite and professional - but I still feel slapped for the whole experience.
It wasted our time and not once did our server or any server come out to explain the long wait for our food or check on us.
Although, we requested spice level 7, it was really a level 1.
We asked 3 times for a chili tray to be refreshed as the chilies were gone - 3 different servers later, brought the chili tray.
We also asked for lemons 2 times in a row, the second person finally brought it for us.
There were a lot of servers but no one wanted to help our table.
Our food was getting cold as were were waiting for these things.
The positive things I could take from this place was that the noodles were moist, the pad kee mao had nice flavor, and the pad thai (although bland) was a massive portion - I feel like it was at least 4 portions that they brought out, which is a good deal.
Yet, I wasn't a fan about the horrible service.
If I ever feel inclined to come back, I would order take out instead.
My search for a no fail and delicious thai restaurant close to home continues.

Spur of the moment lunch time stop turned into restaurant love affair!
That's what happened last weekend between Archi's and I.
What a great find!
What I loved immediately about this place was the warm, welcoming interior.
I forgot that I was in a huge strip mall somewhere in Vegas.
My cucumber salad was sweet and refreshing and my chicken was delicious.
The veggies were fresh and tasty.
Our drinks were filled at all times, and we never went without anything we could need or want.
The prices were fair (really good lunch specials during the week, but we were there on a weekend).
I think this is standard everywhere, but it still bugged me that we weren't able to just pay a little extra to upgrade to brown rice (we had to get the steamed rice that came with the meals and then pay for a huge side of brown rice).
If that's my only real complaint about this terrific restaurant then I know I'll be back (but only when I have to be on this side of town).
There's something so exciting about stumbling in to a new place and being totally blown away by it.
I'll be thinking of this restaurant and that meal for quite some time!

The pad Thai was delicious!
We came here when my parents were in town (from the Midwest) and neither have ever really had Thai food before.
They both loved it.
My mom, who hates spicy things, ordered pad Thai with 0 heat.
I forget what my dad ordered, but he asked for a 7 on heat.
Now, my dad has burned most of his taste buds off over the years from eating spicy things, so most things advertised as spicy barely register for him.
He said the 7 was fine, it had some heat, but it wasn't too much.
I didn't see a kids menu and didn't think to ask for one, but my kids, who are fairly picky, ended up eating fried rice with no problems.
I really enjoyed my experience at Archi's and can't wait to go back.

So good the food you crave it after you et it I will be back.
The service was great this was a spur of the moment place to dine before a movie.I have had a lot of  Thai food around town and this is really good food

My mouth is watering just thinking about this place.
Best thai food around!!
I've enjoyed every single meal I've ever eaten here, and I continue to crave it after I've left.
The service isn't outstanding, but the food is the best part and will keep you coming back for more!
You won't be disappointed if you love some good thai food.
Highly recommend.

Amazing!
Had the pad puck with shrimp and will definitely keep going back!
My bf also had the sweet and sour chicken & shrimp.
Again very good.
Spring rolls as an appetizer and we were all set.
I hope they do carry out because I'd love to have them even when I don't feel like sitting in.

I was introduced to Archi's by a friend of mine shortly after moving to Las Vegas in September and I have been hooked ever since!
Honestly I think I stop in or take home an order at least once a month.
Their beef pad thai and pork satay skewers are two of my staple favorites.
Their lunch special is a great deal with a ton of food that usually adds up to at least two lunches if you take half home like I do.
This place is truly dangerous being a couple blocks from our house but we love the food and the service so I know we will continue to be happy customers!

Food is ridiculously great!
We ordered Spicy Basil (spicy level 3 is perfect, it's spicy enough that you can still taste the flavor) and the Panang (it is curry with a pinch of awesomeness).
This location, W Sahara and Ft Apache, is good if you are not in a rush.
The staff is friendly but you will have to wait alot to get your drinks, to order your food, to get your food, to get your bill....
So on, you get the picture.
This is why I give them a 4 stars.
Otherwise, the food is amaaaaazing and it is perfect location for a date nite (right next door to a theater!

My favorite for Thai food!
I have yet to find better.

This place is so delicious!
Very clean and friendly.
Per my observation, the restroom was also quite tidy!
We ordered the stuffed chicken wings as an appetizer.
I like to call them yums because they are so yummy!
We also ordered Pad Thai (level 3 spicy) and Yellow Curry (level 2 spicy).
The curry was still very hot for my taste, but still delicious!

Yummy!!
The Pork Larb and Chicken Curry fried rice were delicious.
The Spicy Basil was meh.
But my family thoroughly enjoyed the experience.
We can't wait to come back.

Archi's is the kind of place that's been around for a while and pats itself on the back for it.
"Authentic" they say.
Service is average.
It's often enough, but mostly present for ordering.
The menu is the "right" size.
It has noodles, curries, and fried rice dishes without overloading you.
This is a stark contrast to so many other Thai restaurants making menus as large as possible.
I think they understand what their customers ask for at Archi's.
They've certainly shown it works by opening so many locations.
Now, the food.
Archi's is the absolute king of noodle dishes in Vegas.
They have my favorite Pad Thai out of any Thai restaurant I've been to ever.
The intensity of the sauce is simply unmatched.
I also enjoy their pad see ew, but Pad Thai is always my first choice.
The portions are also colossal.
You simply can't leave without a full stomach.
As for everything else, you can find better elsewhere.
Their curries are a rip-off.
Full of bamboo shoots for the most part and nothing else.
Fried rice is simply fine and without any qualities a good fried rice should have: salty, oily, and distinct savory flavor.
The spicy basil is strong in basil flavor, but small in portion.
The spicy eggplant is a bit oversauced but otherwise good.
Noteworthy: lunch specials.
They're a great deal particularly if you dine in.
You'll get your item, an egg roll, a side salad, soup, and a little... dough.. thing I can't explain.
Great deal, great price.
Weekdays only.
For Thai-style noodle cravings, there is simply no better choice from my experience.
For everything else, you can surely find alternatives.
