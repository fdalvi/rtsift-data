Great place!
We've tried other places and my son loves this place the best.
They also serve dinner for them from local restaurants for an added fee of course.

we liked it the one time we used them but their Facebook page says they were closing end of Sep 2012.
Anyone know if that is true?

My kids loved this place.
Unfortunately it had to close due to personal issues of the owner.
Please, someone, open this place back up!
