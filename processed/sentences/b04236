I received some of the worst service I've ever experienced in food service at this location.
Next time you're in the Gilbert area, and you crave Domino's, I recommend you go find another one up the road.
Every time we went to this location, they screwed up our order.
Our last and final visit, we ordered over the phone before coming in to pick it up.
They said it would be ready in 20 minutes.
I arrived with about 5 minutes to spare.
Of course, the location is almost entirely employed by teenagers who look slightly clueless at all times.
The young man who rang me up kept having to correct the charge to my card as he seemed inexperienced with the register.
I then proceeded to sit at that bench in front of their register for OVER ONE HOUR!
I would see customers come and go as well as their delivery employees.
Twice I asked about my order and they said they would check, but then got sidetracked and didn't get back to me.
You would think someone would have noticed me being there for that long, but no.
Finally, after my third and more forcefully worded inquiry, they "found" my pizza which was burnt and dry.
I complained to the manager who only offered me a free 2 liter soda.
Big whoop.
They lost my business forever.

Dominos had a deal for $6 medium pizza, which I thought was a good deal and you get two toppings.
Went to pick it up and they should have just said $6 small pizza, the box was a small.
It serve probably 3 people if they all had 3 pizza each.
When I went to pick it up the guy was on his cellphone, but don't worry he was nice enough to put his phone down when I came in.
Not worth the savings.
