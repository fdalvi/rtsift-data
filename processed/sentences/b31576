I am an experienced pinup model in Las Vegas, NV and I had the pleasure of shooting with Ron on August 17th with my friend, pinup model Darby Fox.
We shot for his Pulp Fiction Book Cover series.
Ron is great to work with, very laid back, funny, and professional.
He is fabulous with lighting and shadows.
He is very versatile as he shoots everything from dogs, to weddings, to pinup.
Darby and I were very pleased with the results.
Plus he had edits finished even before the next day!
We already have our next shoot planned with him in September.
If you are looking to capture your special day, your special canine friend or anything in between book with Ron Dillon Photography!

When my partner and I decided to do an engagement shoot, Ron was the first and only photographer we really wanted.
Even with quirky requests and a bit of uncertainty on our part, Ron was amazing.
There is no way we could be any happier with the finished product, which he had to us so quickly.
We cannot wait to have him there on the big day to capture the moments in a way only he can.
Ron really is a genius and a true artist.

Professional ,fun,creative and an all around great experience !
Great to work with such talent!
