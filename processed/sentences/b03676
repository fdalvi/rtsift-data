I've been going here for the past 4-5 years for my medical care.
Great friendly staff, office runs on time typically and they return all phone calls personally and in good time.
The Nurse Practitioner Patty Hastings is super great.
I tend to see her more by the nature of Dr. Dairiki's schedule, but I don't mind one bit.
Both are professional, friendly, knowledgable and I am very pleased with my care.
Dr. Dairiki delivered my first baby and I will stick with her for the next.
Small world too...
I found out that 3 of my friends all go to this office too and LOVE it...as much as you can love an OBGYN appointment I suppose.

Both Patti Hastings and Dr. Dairiki are amazing.
My first visit was very informative and fun for a first time mom-to-be.
I wasn't one of the lucky women as I lost my pregnancy at 8 weeks.
I wanted to write this review complimenting their professionalism, sympathy and sense of urgency in this matter.
I found out on Wednesday that I lost my pregnancy and Dr. Dairiki was able to perform my D and C on that Friday.
She was extremely helpful in my post-op appointment and understood my emotional reaction.
She and I spoke and she recommended I see counselor as most women do not take the time to grieve their loss.
I took her advise and am doing great!
I can't wail to conceive again to make visiting her office more frequent.

Finally getting around to my reviews.
Got to give good ones where they are due!
I was very happy with my care in the hands of Dr. Dairiki and NP Patty Hastings.
The entire staff is friendly, professional and helpful.
The offices are in a nice location and are clean an cheery.
They are very comfortable to speak with and prompt with their replies.
I enjoyed my years as a patient there and will miss them.

The office staff, dr. Dairiki and Patty Hastings are great!
Easy scheduling, clean office and friendly staff.
