They shut down the old Krispy Kreme in this area and for a while I mourned the loss... though my arteries thanked me.
*sigh..
SO I guess they decided to open one up a new one in an even more convenient location (right across the movie theaters) - so now when you come out of a movie and you haven't gotten enough over-priced popcorn, soda, and movie nachos, you can just walk across and buy a dozen donuts you don't need.
Because you will buy a dozen.
Like I did...
But whether you just got out of a movie or are actually planning to get donuts, it's worth it to stop in and hang out for a bit.
You can see the people behind the counter making the donuts and there is actually a little milk/coffee bar.
Oh, and be sure to pick up a Krispy Kreme hat for the kiddies.

Almost gone but not forgotten in the Chicago land area.
Pretty well stocked in the grocery bakery section, but still no stores to get the fresh ones!
Pleasantly surprised and highly impressed with the huge selection of donuts.
Favorites are the custard filled and sour cr√®me donuts.
Tastes so much better than Dunkin Donuts.
Arizona residents...how lucky you are!!

Is there much to say about this place people don't already know?
Yes, as much as a dollar a doughnut is pretty steep, but who can complain when you see them coming fresh off the conveyor belt?
I don't think anything compares to watching the glaze harden between your fingers as you take the first bite.
WTF about that kids meal though.
Two doughnuts and a bottle of sugary milk?
You want your kid to bounce off the walls all week?
Anyways, good product, good location.
I'm a fan!

The return of krispy kreme is less than good..employees don't give a crap, menu is smaller, kinda ghetto

over-rated, air-inflated garbage.

I prefer Dunkin Donuts, however, Krispy Kreme isn't bad!
I really love watching them make the donuts, it's pretty intriguing.
I am not fond of the location, however this building is much more fitting for Krispy Kreme than the other one where Corner Bakery Cafe now stands.
It's probably a good thing for those movie-goers who are craving something sweet right after catching a flick.

I am not a donut fan.
I don't really care much about Krispy Kreme either, but I did try to go in there twice over the weekend, once they were closed (it was 10:15pm) but they had just closed.
I thought that it's pretty cool for a place like that to be open so late with all of the other stuff around so thumbs up for that.
And then a couple days later we made it in and had pretty good service.

These donuts don't taste good anymore.
They have an aftertaste like they are using a different type of oil
