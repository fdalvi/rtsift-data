The best experience I have ever had with pest control.
I was misfortunate enough to encounter a very horrible pest issue and they were incredible.
Honest, and informative, the owner Dave came himself and did everything that needed to be done.
Not to mention a follow up and extremely reasonable pricing.
This company deserves your business and your reviews!
I will never use another pest control company again.

Just had Dave from Hidden City Pest control come out to spray my house.
Dave comes over every month and does a great job spraying the outside and inside of my house.
He lifts up every cover and sprays in places you wouldn't think about.
He always is very pleasant and knowledgable about any pest problems.
I have never had to have him come back for a respray even though he is always offering.
He says if I have any problems he will be back for free.
But he does such a though job I see no need for this guarantee.
His prices can not be beat.
Very reasonable and he doesn't require a contract to keep my business.
If you want a honest and realiable pest controll company then this is the one to choose.

Hidden City Pest Control is the best of the best.
For 20 years I have used Hidden City for pest control services personally and professionally.
They always do a great job.
Easy to work with as far as scheduling and they are always prompt, reliable, courteous, professional, knowledgable and guarantee their work.
In 20 years I have never had to have a re-spray on any property.
Also best bang for your buck to boot.
I  recommend Hidden City Pest Control to everyone.
Thanks Dave!
