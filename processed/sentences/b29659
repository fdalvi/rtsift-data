It's a nice park.
Even if the playground is dirty.

The upgraded park is so much more better and much more cleaner than the park it was a few years ago!
There is a tons of room to run several laps, (for those that enjoy a run) as well as a skate park for those that enjoy skating and bmx, everyone minds their own when they're here, and it's just a nice park to enjoy on a beautiful sunny day, or hot.
I know a lot of people don't think that this side of town is safe but I feel that it is.
The police academy is right across the street and so is the fire station.
