This place is off the strip so the prices are better here.
Has everything you need to take to the hotel.
Local types here and friendly service.
Not a lot of transients hanging around like other places in the area.

Drug dealers aren't perfect.
Thankfully, there's Walgreens.

I normally don't come to Walgreens to buy anything as they are more pricey then Walmart, but I do like that this is very convenient and close to my house.
The times I've gone the store is clean, organized and quiet.
Never really had a problem finding the item that I went in to buy.
