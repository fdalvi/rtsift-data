I have seen more accommodating and pleasant lobbies at auto repair facilities.
Ghetto like atmosphere.
Stark, plastic folding chairs and green laminate flooring with dull play-do gray walls.
No pictures or artwork.
Looks like a 40" TV.
I am no designer, but this place is drab and needs decorating.
The wait was also about 20 minutes to get in.

Horrendous from beginning to end, I had an appointment for 8:00 AM to get lab work done, it was 1 hr and 15 minutes after my appointment time before I was called back, close to 3 people who came in after me went before me.
The place itself is dirty, crowded, and noisy.
I wonder what is the point of making an appointment when it still takes over an hour to get in?
There was a man who came in without one and they told him it would take an hour.
So really what is the point?

For more than a year I've gone to this lab at least monthly and sometimes more often for blood draws and routine testing.
At first I would try to "psych out" a time when I figured few others would also be there - I was almost never right.
But, without fail, behind the reception desk sat Ruta Tanai, patience personified.
I've never seen her upset, never heard her lose her temper (as many who are waiting do), never found her to be anything but helpful,  professional and pleasant.
Going to the lab, for whatever reason, is not something most people look forward to but if Ruta Tanai is the one who will take your information and orders and insurance card/s, then things just got a lot better!
Thanks Ruta!

I didn't have an appointment on a Monday afternoon.
I only had to wait 15 minutes.
I don't like needles but Ray was excellent in drawing my blood!
he was very professional.
I would recommend Ray.
Thank you!
