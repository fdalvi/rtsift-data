This is the place for jazz lovers and gramophone geeks.
I know there are many of the former, but not so many of the latter.
I heard about this place through a guy called Kim who plays 78s between 7 & 8 every Wednesday at the Forest Cafe (and has done for a very long time).
When you're a gramophone geek, there are very specific things that you need, for example needles for the gramophone (since they have to be changed every time you play it) and gramophone records.
But you can also get quite cheap records here.
The shops specialises in jazz and swing records, and has solo female artists such as Billie Holiday and Ella Fitzgerald records.
It's definitely a gem of a place and if you find yourself around the area, itching to get your hand on some vinyl, or just pop into a magical place that seems to be quite anachronistic, then head there.
Plus, what an awesome name, huh?

If you need a Gramophone, this is where to go to.
There is a great range as you'd expect.
Fun portable picnic Deccas to nice oak enclosed HMV cabinets.
Even Thomas Edison phonographs.
There are machines to suit all tastes and budgets.
Their forte is classical and operatic 78rpm records.
The walls are covered with shelves full of thousands of incredibly rare records.
The cheaper things sold are 78rpm 1950s popular songs.
Some great Blues and Jazz turn up from time to time.
the shop is a piece of history itself.
