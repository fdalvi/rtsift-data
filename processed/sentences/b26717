The staff was great and Dr. Chandler was very nice and professional.
I was referred from a friend to see her since she had a great experience.
They take almost all insurances.
If you need to get your eyes check, go to this office!

Dr. Chandler is Fantastic.
I was a little leery about going to an optometrist in a VisionWorks location.
But I could be happier with my visit.
It's easy to schedule an appointment and I didn't have wait around when I arrived for my appointment.
Dr. Chandler is very nice and would recommend her to everyone.
And as a bonus her staff is professional and courteous!
Great job Dr. Chandler and staff!

Dr. Chandler has been my eye doctor for at least 6 years.
I recently had an eye issue and needed to be seen asap.
Her staff was so helpful in getting me in for an appointment and treatment.
Thanks so much and I will refer everyone I know to you.

I had some discomfort in my eye and found Dr. Chandler on Yelp.
I called for an appointment and they were able to squeeze me in that day.
When I went into the office the receptionist was courteous and thorough.
I met Dr. Chandler and explained the issue I was having.
She was so friendly and attentive.
She diagnosed my problem and gave me suggestions for some different over the counter eye drops as well as a prescription for eye drops.
She also gave me samples of some new contact lenses to try.
I scheduled a follow up appointment and ordered some new contact lenses.
Dr. Chandler is such a great doctor.
I felt really comfortable with her.
She doesn't rush your visit and genuinely listens and talks to you.
If you are looking for an optometrist then definitely go see Dr. Chandler.
She is great at what she does and makes a visit to the eye doctor as pleasant as can be.
