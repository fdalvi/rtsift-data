I took in a guitar, they said they didnt that that kind.
I took in a drill, a poker set, a saw, and a drill set and they said no we dont take that.
Well apparently they dont take anything.

Poor service

I read the reviews here first, but went into the business on a Sunday(today) because everyone else in this area was closed.
The wait wasn't long, but the young lady appraising the diamond ring I brought in didn't even check the clarity/carat weight of the diamonds in the ring before returning with a pawn value of $137!
This ring retailed for $2600 a tast year ago.
There's no way possible it's depreciated to that extent.
My advice would be to go to more experienced appraisers if you have jewelry.
