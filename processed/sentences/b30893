I went here on a Saturday evening around 7 after having spent a few hours at the pool followed by a burger at Grind Burger.
Anyway, there were 2 or 3 other parties relaxing and smoking when my group of 4 arrived.
We were promptly greeted by the hostess/waitress and seated in the main lounge area (they also have some private rooms in the back).
I ordered Blue Mist for myself and the hubby and my friends ordered fruit loopz.
We all agreed the Blue Mist was way better--it's one of my favs anyway.
Before 8pm hookahs are $12.
The "hookah guy" was very attentive and came by frequently to check the coals.
The four of us sat and talked for about 2 hours, intermittently smoking and sipping our Fiji water ($4).
Mind you, these type of places don't serve water in a glass for free; you ask for water and you get a bottle.
This is my new favorite hookah lounge in Las Vegas.

This Place is Fantastic.
Super cool service and act that takes place with the coals!
This place is a must visit!

We just happened to pull the door open a bit after hours and the the owner and some of his friends were there finishing up their night and invited us in, for a few puffs.
the atmosphere was very very chill, a bit dark.
but it was after hours.
Tobacco flavor they were smoking was some kind of apple, very good.
the workers and the friends her had there did not make us feel like we were intruding.
i will definitely be paying you guys a visit, next time i'm in vegas.
Even just to say thanks for your hospitality.

When you enter, it is VERY dark.
On the right, there are all the booths and on the left there's one long couch with a bunch of tables and hookahs lined up.
There was only one group of people when we came in and no one by the door, so we waited a few seconds and a guy came out from the back to seat us.
We were solely there to have some tapas and we explained that to him.
He gave us a small booth in the back, which was nice and secluded and he took out two of the hookahs (there was 3 on the tiny table) so we could have room for the food.
We couldn't help but bust out our cameras because the place just looked so sexy!
The dark red and blue lighting, painted walls, and orange lit hookahs just gave it a very hip look.
We perused through the menu, which included some funky names such as "Wanna eat a pita?
" and "Sum Yum Guy Satay" that we both found pretty amusing.
They also had a decent list of teas, including flowering tea ($12 a pot) and even some smoothies.
We ended up ordering the following:  White Rose Tea - Very aromatic.
I added a little sugar to mine and it was just perfect.
Very subtle and relaxing.
I can't get over the scent!
Mo'Rockin Beef Bowl (Slow cooked rib-eye on a bed of jasmine white rice) - This came in a pretty big bowl, which was perfect for sharing.
However, Don enjoyed it a lot more than I did.
I personally found it to be a little bland, but the meat was very tender  Sharing is Caring Sampler ($16), included the following:  Not Your Fava Bean Dip ("Fool Mudammas" mixed with onions, cilantro, tomatoes, and olive oil) - I actually liked this more than the hummus.
It was smooth and it really did taste like a mild bean dip.
Very good with the pita bread  Sweet N Sweeter Chicken (Baked chicken honey on a bed of clementines) - Again, Don enjoyed this more than I did.
I think it's more of an acquired taste that I can imagine many people liking, but it really just tasted like chicken that was rolled in honey bunches of oats to me, so I found it a little odd.
Stuff it up your Kofta Kabob  (Marinated Egyptian ground beef stuffed with feta cheese and grilled on a skewer) - We both liked this a lot.
The meat was juicy and flavorful, so I ended up pairing it with the caprese on the side.
Mo'Rockin Caprese (Feta cheese with tomatoes, cilantro, and Thai basil) - The feta was a little overpowering for me, so I ended up only eating all of the tomatoes with the Kabob, but they were very fresh and went perfectly with the kabob.
This Isn't About Me, It's About Hummus - This came on a big dish with a basket of pita bread.
It was pretty grainy, but the flavor was just right and, when mixed with the bean dip, it made for a very pleasant dip.
Jo' Momma's Baklava (Fillo dough pastry stuffed with candied almonds and walnuts) - I've never had Baklava before this, so I didn't know what to expect.
I liked that it came out nice and warm.
It was also very flaky, which I am always a fan of and it had a delicate sweetness that was just right.
Don, however, thought it had a "weird" taste, but I didn't detect that.
The service was top notch, even though they didn't fill up our water glasses every single time they went empty, but that was completely understandable because the place is very dark.
You can tell they really work as a team here because we were always checked up on and served by about four different people.
The music was actually pretty good.
They had a variety of reggae and some pretty upbeat music.
I noticed they even accept requests.
Some guy in one of the other booths ended up requesting "Bad Boys" and started dancing.
My only real complaint is that their tables are WAY too small.
At least if you're there to eat, which I'm sure majority of the customers aren't there for.
All of our plates were given to us one by one because there wasn't room for a lot at once.
This was just a small problem though, since the place is a hookah lounge and not an actual sit down restaurant.
All in all, we really enjoyed coming here.
The ambiance was awesome and the service was tiptop.
If we come here again I definitely want to get a hookah, maybe Fruit Loop flavor, and try their Cheesecake Lollipops.
Yum!

Amazing hookah!
Perfect atmosphere.
The hookah attendants were right on everything.
We also went to another hookah place but came right back here every night for our Vegas vacation.
The guy watching the coals was super nice and instructed us how to make the most out of our hookah at home.
It was the first place we tried sarbuzz tobacco and am defiantly hooked.
The only downside is I was used to my weaker smoke at home so the thick smoke made me a little sick.
If you are a regular smoker it shouldn't be a issue.
On more not they never make you feel rushed and never let the tobacco burn.We were their for 2 hours and the smoke never died down.

Awesome place , the staff is super friendly , "Bink" was very attentive to our table an makes a mean mojito!
We will definitely makes this a must spot whenever in Vegas

I never come to vegas without coming here!
I love this place!

Wow, there are so many hookah lounges in Vegas!
That is one thing you do not get to experience in Hawaii, unless you set one up in your living room.
When I first walked in, I noticed that its pretty dark in here.
It is nothing like Rhumbar, which is well-lit (and obviously outdoors).
There are booths and cushioned sofas against the walls.
I like the lighting of the tables where the hookahs were placed.
Bf said the bathrooms are cool, maybe the mens bathroom has more decorations.
The womens bathroom is nothing special but its very clean at least!
Another thing about the atmosphere is that they play a lot of good music, and there are music videos playing on the mounted TVs...
Yet they do not match.
I guess they dont have surround sound yet!
Another cool thing is they put ice in the water so you get better smoke.
We ordered a Starbuzz Pink flavor and it was pretty tasty.
I liked that there was always someone walking around to change coals (kind of dangerous looking basket with hot coals).
We did not order any food, but the kabobs smelt really good.
We did have a drink.
I think somewhere on the menu it says all hookah orders come with one drink order per person (but not included in the hookah price).
They have menu sets that come with entrees, a bowl of hookah, and a drink for two people, three, and so on.
The service was not bad, all the guys that work there were really nice.
I ordered a shot of ouzo straight and the guy who brought it to me kept asking me if I wanted it on the rocks.
Well it was probably the strongest drink I have ever had but I wasnt about to change my mind for him.
Good looking out, man!
We also got 15% off our bill thanks to the Yelp deal!
Sweeeet.
Its all good.
We had a relaxing time here and left happy.
I may come back again.

I don't smoke hookah, heck I don't smoke anything, constantly therefore I'm always very reluctant when I'm invited to a hookah lounge.
But I was visiting a friend and they all decided to go, therefore I said WTH!
When I arrived we were attended promptly, not bad.
Our hookah was brought out to us fairly quick, good.
And they were serving this peach tea, which was sooooo good, excellent!
Totally made my night to find out that there were actual hookah/cafes that served GOOD teas.
I'm sold.
I will def visit this place again when I'm in the area.

The location is near the Hard Rock Casino about a mile away from the Strip.
The menu and method of ordering is somewhat complicated.
For example our group of four people had to have two hookahs because one has to order a hookah for every two people at Azuza.
The place has a vibe that defies its locale in a strip mall.
It's lit darkly and has a very relaxed vibe to it.
The hookahs were strong and were well prepared.
I would consider walking from Nashville to Las Vegas to get some of the  delicious Peach tea.
After a day on the Strip: collecting cards advertising local ladies,getting lapdances from Chloe and Destiny, picking winners and busting up blackjack tables, Azuza is a nice place to conclude a victorious evening in Las Vegas.

I came here a year ago.
I liked it better last year, possibly because they had alcohol.
This time that I went, they didn't have alcohol anymore.
They said because it got too crazy, drunk ass people throwing up all over the place, broken hookahs.
I completly understand why they removed the alcohol...  :(   But it was a good time overall.

Stopped in here for a quick snack because I was already in the shopping center.
I'm not one for hooka lounges, there dark, smoky and the coals scare the hell out me!
I walked in and ordered hummus and pita to go.
They charged my card and than told me it be a 10-15 min wait.
While I waited inside I noticed it had a good vibe and seemed clean and neat.
And than the coal guy came out from the back with a hot coal basket.
Its bad enough I'm freaked out by just the presence of the coals BUT than the guy stood right in front of me and swung the basket around in circles.
I'm not talking about circles and inch wide and in front of him, but over the head down to his feet full arm swinging circles.
Hot little ashes flying everywhere.
I sunk back into the chair freaked out!
REALLY?
There was no one there that even could see what he was doing except me and I was obviously freaked out by it!
Talk about a fire hazard!
After my shock I ended up waiting for nearly a half hour before the chef came out and handed me my togo bag apologizing for the delay.
Got home and enjoyed some really tasty hummus and pita.
Had enough left over to snack on the next day too.
If it wouldn't have been for the wait and the fact the guy came out going crazy with the coals than I'd rate this place a little higher.

Totally a place to relax an chill.
Food...hookah...music...just a great to relax from a long day!!

This was my first hookah experience!
But since I'm more about food, let me start there!
Chicks on your grill ... grilled chicken and rice.
A little bland, especially after eating the Cry Baby Curry!
OMG this was so delish!!
In fact, we came here twice while in Vegas and I ordered it both times.
The hummus and pita ... again, delish!
The first time here we had some sort of mint hookah.
It was good but after a while, gave me a stomach ache.
LOL.
Next time I should eat before I smoke hookah.
The 2nd time we were here, we had double apple ... it was really good but again, got a stomach ache for just a short bit.
LOL.
What a sissy!

Nice place :) not the best, but if you're searching for nearby smoke this is the place.

one of the best places for a hookah i've been to.
clean establishment, friendly service.
hookahs are served with ice water in the base, providing a nicer experience.
the coals are routinely changed out -- correctly with the filters blown out between.
some minor items i did not enjoy -- - table space is tight in some areas with tables butting up against your shins - pricing is overly complicated and ridiculous - cost is fairly expensive after the inclusion of a "one drink minimum per person"

I loved it here.
The menu is clear.
Prices are fair.
The ambiance is prefect.
I could stay here all day/night.
The staff were exceptional.
This place has already been recommended to friends and I will continue to do so.
I say yes!

First off, I'm pretty sure most of these other reviews were written by people that work there because after reading the reviews my friends and I made the trek off the strip to go there and was gravely mislead.
It has to be one of the worst hookah bars I have been to.
The service was poor at best.
My friends and I were waiting for at least 15 minutes for a server to give us menus.
We then had to decipher to overly complicated menu and pricing.
During all of this we were crammed into a tight table area and not allowed to move even though the rest of the bar was barren.
After we found out that their alcohol license was revoked, we ordered some of their "specialty drinks", which turned out to be some mediocre tea and sugar.
This entire process of took over an hour until actually receiving our drinks, which didn't come until after we got our hookahs (max of 2 people per hookah).
On top of this, the tip was included on the check regardless of the lousy service.
Overall we ended up biting the bullet and just paying and getting back to the strip as fast as possible.
I do not recommend this place as you would be better off finding another establishment.
1 Star

I've been to a lot of hookah bars, and this one was quite easily the worst.
The service was ridiculously slow, and the hookah tasted kinda funky.
I ordered some Moroccan mint iced tea that was strange tasting as well.
Luckily, the diet coke I ordered to replace the mint iced tea was normal.
Though I'm not sure what other options there are for hookah in Vegas, I would recommend avoiding this place.

Great place to hang out  Fantastic hookah

This is the worst place ever!!!
Hookah was good but if you want to pay for a service & be treated like shit then this is definitely the place to go.
Our waitress was a complete A-hole!!!!
My friend & I went there thinking we'd have a good GNO but instead we were treated like dirt.
The young guy changing out the coals was nice enough to take our order.
When we asked him to get our waitress he signaled to her to come & told her we needed something....she in turn waved for him to handle us after she saw it was our table.
Never going back!!
Too bad too cuz we tend to smoke A LOT of hookah with all our friends.
This all went down @ the Charleston location

This place has unanimously won the best hookah place in Vegas in my book.
I've visited almost ALL local hookah lounges/restaurants in the valley and I've come to the easy conclusion that Azuza Hookah Lounge & Cafe is the best there is.
Here is why:  1) HOOKAH: Everything they do leading up to making a good hookah bowl is pretty standard and similar to most places, however, the ice-filled bases are a HUGE plus in terms of smoothness.
The employee knowledge on the different types of hookah smoking is impressive and informative.
They are excellent with their ability to match/mix flavors to your liking.
They are understanding when you're not satisfied and will not hesitate to please your hookah taste buds (at least in many of my experiences).
SEVERAL of the bowls I've had there last long (beyond two hours).
Of course that can change with the frequency of your smoking.
The hookahs and hoses are all a high quality and clean (fancy too).
2) FOOD/DRINKS: The food is excellent.
All organic and fresh.
You can't find another hookah lounge with food at these prices that taste like this.
The drinks are eclectic (non-alcoholic).
None of them disappoint.
Anything from hot tea to iced juices are awesome.
3) EMPLOYEES: The employees are respectful, knowledgeable, and friendly.
I treat the employees with respect and they return with respect as well.
They handle any issue you have with food or hookah willingly, respectfully, and swiftly.
It can get busy at times and service can take longer at times, but that's how it gets sometimes.
They know the menu and are excellent with recommendations.
They have uniforms that allow customers to distinct who is an employee and who isn't (some places don't do that).
4) AMBIANCE: Good clean space.
It's a lounge so when I see people complain about "table space" I would suggest going to a restaurant.
I make due with the space at hand.
The music ranges from electric, dub-step, hip hop, and reggae.
They mix it up often.
I LOVE when they play reggae there.
The music isn't played at an ear-piercing volume consistently (like other hookah places).
5) PRICE: Reasonable & fair.
The regular price for hookah is the similar to all the hookah places in the Valley but there is a happy hour for hookah from 5-8PM.
I go there during that time often.
The food is worth the money and so are the drinks.
I have my own hookahs at home (several of them) but when I want to wind down from a hard day work, I choose no other place than Azuza Hookah Lounge & Cafe.
It's an awesome hookah place with culture, good food, good drinks, and friendly employees.
I follow then on twitter and facebook for any specials they may have.
Thank you Azuza.

The place is over priced ...
Drinks were bad dint even deserve one star the hookah was try badddd and they charged us twice ....."

Please note I am middle eastern and my expectations of hookah and a hookah lounge are probably very different than a non middle eastern hookah lover.
as soon as we walked in we were greeted very nicely.
the staff was very polite...no complaints there... my start rating is based on environment and hookah quality.
the place was practically empty since it was a random Thursday night.
we had three people in my party.
we sat at the big comfortable corner, they asked us to move since there was a minimum of 4 to be able to sit there.
that bothered me since the place was empty and we wanted to be comfortable.
not to mention It was not a smart business decision since my group of three middle eastern women were going to each order one hookah which is more than what a group of non middle easterners would smoke which Is generally one per two people (which is Another rule of theirs.. minimum one hookah for 2 people) the hookah prices were high but I guess that's just vegas my hookah and my friends hookah had an overwhelming mint flavor.
when I told them, they switched the hose out and I ended up with a plastic china hose instead of a traditional hose.
not ok for me.
they didn't like that I took the foil off the hookah head, but I don't like to smoke like that.
the place is not a place to go if you are hoping for a traditional middle eastern hookah experience.
i don't want to wrap the parameter of the heads w foil, i don't want to sit on couches that have no backs, i don't want to smoke hookahs that are sitting on top of tables (hard to reach to rearrange coal) and i don't want to taste mint when i order grape...
I also don't want to sit in an uncomfortable table and see 3 open corners just cause I didn't meet the minimum requirement of how many people need to be in my group just to sit there.
note: the staff really tried and was very friendly.

Best Hookah Ever!
Food is good, prices are reasonable, n staff is always friendly.
I do hookah often n this place is one of the best I've been to..I always go here when I visit Vegas.
I love Azuza!

I've been a supporter of this hookah lounge for years.
The service is top notch.
Great music and a very attentive staff.
Great flavors.
Try the Poms on your Sweet Melon.
They also have very nice flowering teas.
Just tried the new Thai tea and it is really good!

I always stop in here after I eat at Kaizen.
This is a cool little hookah place across from the Hardrock Hotel on Paradise & Harmon.
The guy the that changes the charcoals puts on a show.
He swings the hot coals around and throws them around.
I'm waiting for him to catch the place on fire.....just kidding.
I haven't seen drop one yet.

This place is absolutely sketchy and a total rip off

Staff is super helpful and friendly and they play great music.
I ordered two hookahs in a way that would have cost more than had I just ordered a refill, so the manager personally came over to explain to me how I could save some money if I ordered differently.
Her hospitality made me of course order an additional dish and an additonal refill.
Great vibe for a low key night off the strip - must visit.
I smoke hookah all the time but their froot loops hookah is among the best I've had anywhere.
Try that and banana kush, you won't be disappointed.

The employees here are so freaking rude it's beyond belief.
I have never seen an employee yell at a paying customer before.
The hookah is pretty good, but it's not worth getting yelled at over.

Talk about heavy hand on my crown!
Great service and I would definitely go again!
My only complaint is I couldn't use my Yelp coupon for a free flatbread and hummus because they said I had to print it out and bring it in..... however I got it anyways and was really good.

This place was great!
Our server Mariah was extremely helpful and attentive.
We had three different tapas split between 2 of us, but we probably could have done with just 2 as the portions were pretty generous by tapas standards.
The food itself was delicious.
I highly recommend the kofta sliders!
We ordered a large pot of the Egyption aliwizah(?
) tea which our server regularly kept filled to the brim with hot water without any asking.
The hookah itself was the smoothest we've ever had and the staff were great about coming around regularly to knock off the ash.
The flavor itself wasn't spot on (we had 'pumpkin pie'), but it was still pretty good.
Would highly recommend if you're looking to take a nice relaxing break from the Vegas strip.

We went for hookah and a light meal with low expectations.
Little did I know the food would be incredible and reasonably priced.
They had a large selection of shisha and were well versed in the different brands.
I loved the fact it wasn't a "dine and dash" and the staff routinely stopped by to service the coals.
The only negative was the drink prices, but hey... this is Vegas.

While on vacation in Vegas my friends and I wanted to unwind the night at a hookah lounge.
Worst decision we made all trip.
Lets start out by saying the employees there are horrible, constantly walking by and never once asking if we need anything or checking up on us.
When we did finally get service they messed our drink up and had no explanation for the mess up but that they followed the measurements from a book.
The bartender comes out and gives attitude but when he seen how mad we were he said he would comp us our drinks next round on the house.
The bartender tried playing us for fools, comes out with 4 shots of papaya juice with not one single drop of alcohol in them.
At this point we decided to leave, my friends wife goes to pay with the coupon they advertised and the host wouldn't except it saying they no longer advertise on that website even though my friends wife showed her the coupon on her phone and that it was still up and valid.
Host responds by just saying I don't know what to tell you but we don't accept that coupon any longer.
The entire evening was a disaster and the atmosphere was just horrible!!
This would be the last place I would ever step foot in when in Vegas again.

We are from L. A.
And we have been here first time.
They are cool.
Nice service.... good job guys :)

The place is nice, the only thing that's annoying is the music and the TV's.
Aside from all of that it's one hell of a place.
I would highly recommend this place.

I have a habit of hitting up hookah lounges in different major cities.
It's difficult to find a hookah lounge that doesn't make you run in the opposite direction.
This place has to be the best one I have ever been to.
Great service, great hookah, great drinks.
The lounge is hip, quaint, and clean.
They actually understand nobody wants to sit on disgusting cushions, eat off nasty tables, look at walls or ceilings falling apart, and deal with rude service.
I highly recommend this lounge.
It's not far from the Strip and it won't break the bank.

I don't know why I keep giving this place another try... Service is terribly slow.
From ordering drinks to getting the check, wait time was too ridiculous.
Workers were not attentive.
They see us waiting and looking bored but never cared to stop by.
They never came by to refill the coals.
It's really not that hard to observe your customers once in a while.
Also, the free appetizer coupon for first check-in was bogus.
During my first time here, the waitress said they do not accept the coupons via phone apps anymore, and I would have to print it out and give it to them.
C'mon, how is anyone supposed to know to print the coupon if it's their first time checking-in?
Spend your time and money on something else folks.

The hookah is the best in Vegas and the staff is very knowledgeable and friendly!
I keep coming back here and I would recommend in to anyone who comes to Vegas or locals!

Nice chill spot.
A little warm inside.
But easy menu and no rush attitude.
Rayna is sweet and easy on the eyes too boot.
Will be back.

I stumbled upon Azuza through yelp after researching a couple  of hooka places to visit .
I do not regret coming here at all .
The place has a great atmosphere and everyone here is so attentive .
The jasmine tea was delicious and was refilled many times throughout our visit (ot was especially good with a bit of the provided honey).
Everyone should try the hummus and pita bread .
I would definitely come back again on my next visit to vegas.
Long live Azuza!

Place is simply awesome.
Has a cool and relaxing vibe, best hookah lounge I've gone to so far

Every time I come to Vegas this place is a must stop!
The Hookahs are the best in the city and Stephen is the GM and if he is here he will stop by chat with you and shows you a great time!
If you don't come by you are losing out!

Amazing food!
Highly recommend also a great vibe.
The food is fresh and satisfying!
Make sure to schedule time, due to the food being fresh, they need time to prepare, but def worth the wait!

Great food as well as an outstanding environment.
Amazing drink concoction delicious and a lot house made mixtures.
Staff was very welcoming with great service they knew every question I had and catered to any flavors of hookah I needed.
It's defiantly a chill relaxed intimate casual place to hang out with your friends.
I loved the variety of music they had.
I will defiantly be back!!!!

Love this place.
Great hookah.
Great drinks and service.
The mint hookahs are the eat.
My fave drink that I always get is the horny latte.
It's delicious.
I seriously could drink those all say.
Autum is a great as a sever.
Whenever my friends out of town visit we start the night here.
It's def a great pregame place.

I was trying to find a good place to eat late and stumbled across this joint.
Really awesome food and tea.
I would specially recommend their sliders and sharing is caring entree.
Their mint tea is the best I have ever had.
Will definitely come here again

As a Vegas local, this place is great.
For being so close to the strip they have excellent prices, amazing service and chill music.
I love how they are open until 3 on Saturdays as well as the quality of their drinks and hookah.
We got the jasmine/mint mix and they gave us ice in base with great coals for free.
We sat in the private room for free, which was awesome.
The manager, Steven sat with us and would chat and care about what we thought.
This is by far the best hookah lounge I've been to, and I highly recommend it.

I thought their old location was the best in town.
Now being over 21 and checking out this spot my mind has been changed.
The music, decor, vibes, quality of product, and service are all top notch.
I recommend coming into one of their private rooms to relax and appreciate the chill vibes.
Again the service and hookah are great!
I got a glass of wine and jasmine mint hookah and have enjoyed every minute.
Plus the pricing for being so close to the strip is amazing.
I highly recommend this spot!

This place is amazing.
I loved the atmosphere and the service.
The hookah was delicious and very flavorful.
Most of all the GM Stephan was very accommodating and just awesome.
He made sure everything was great and really made you feel as if you were welcome and comfortable.
I will definitely be coming back.

A good mix of people and good times !
Get there early because this spot fills up quick!!!!!
Great drinks and AWESOME food!!!
I'm going tonight!!!!

This place doesn't deserve even one star.
I am here right now.
First of all, we order alfaker double apple with mint and it came with full mint itself.
We asked them to remake it and it took them 40 mins to make a new head.
The store manager came up and said it is full capacity.
WTF, if they can't handle the full capacity, why do they accept the customer until it gets full???
Good interior design doesn't make a good store.
What kind of service they provide makes a good one.
I don't recommend this place.
Very disappointed.

Hookahs  were good  Music was mellow and relaxing  Seating was nice and comfortable   Great if your goin to a small place and want something for the moment

just came in, so far so good, slow night, its a wednesday, no shyt.... but overall enviornment is well placed.
hookah setup is well done to increase the friendlyness/homefeel of the place.
recommend to hookah smokers in las vegas.... price is average, $12 base hookahs, $20 for name brands.... alcohol served.. so far so good....

I liked this place.
Good music, good atmosphere, good choices!
We ordered drinks, they were fairly steep considering the quality of them.
Overall it was ok, only because we had already been drinking so it seemed like a good decision.
I would have rated this place a 5 star except their service was pretty slow.
If I am back into town and in the mood, I'd go back!

This place is AMAZING!
I have never had such good service in my life, every time me and my boyfriend go in they treat us like family.
Their hookahs are great and the food is always on point (try the caprese you will not regret it).
This is most definitely one of my favorite places in Vegas.
But once again I have to compliment the staff they really make your experience amazing I wish I could give them six stars!

Great service, good Hookah, and good food for a decent price.
I would definitely suggest this place if you are looking for a chill hookah lounge while in Vegas.

Great spot with great atmosphere.
The staff was amazing they were soooo helpful and friendly.
They kept checking on us and making sure everything was good.
I would definitely recommend this place to my friends.

This is place is great!!!
The food is amazing and most importantly the hookah is one the best I had.

I hadn't been to a hookah bar in a long time, and I never would have even thought about going here, but we finished dinner at Ferraro's and didn't feel like going to the Strip.
Somehow, we looked up and stumbled upon this Azuza.
It was a really great hidden gem!
The ambiance was typical hookah bar- Middle Eastern decor, lots of comfy couches, dark lighting.
The hookahs were very good and were serviced regularly.
They have a guy who walks around doing tricks with the hot coals, so that was pretty cool.
The music was fantastic- top 40/hip hop, which was perfect.
Enough to feel like you were having a night out, but not so loud that you can't have a conversation.
They even have private/VIP rooms.
The seating is comfortable and the service is also good.
The only downside is that the drinks are rather pricey, especially since this is not a Strip bar/lounge.
I definitely wasn't expecting $15 cocktails here.
They were fine, but nothing special.
The bathroom also could have been a bit cleaner.
We even saw Flava Flav here, so that was a fun surprise!

We have been to many hookah lounges, and this is by far our absolute favorite!!!
The environment is awesome, and the staff is gorgeous and super friendly!!!
Vanity, Libby and Reyna are the best!!!!
If you want a cool place to relax and have a great meal, come to azuza hookah!!
