Zk grill is do delicious and fresh tasting!
It'sy favorite restaurant in Ahwatukee!!!
The chicken and beef skewer kabob combo is to die for!

I've been here a few times already.
If you love the Persian Room then I think you'll love this place.
I normally get the chicken with half salad and half rice with a grilled tomato.
They have a pomegranate vinegarette and a champagne vinegarette.
I usually prefer the champagne.
The tomato is just really outstanding and the chicken is moist, tender, and flavorful on a bed of fluffy rice.
They also serve yogurt soda, which I've yet to try.
The first time i tried it was at the Persian room which is very unique.
They're really friendly here and very quick to make your meal.
They only problem is get here fast, because they close at 8.

I eat here at least once a week.
The portions are very generous and the food is outstanding.
I usually get the beef and chicken combo and it is always great.
Service is quick and friendly.
