Robin is a great owner and care taker of a variety of birds in her store.
The Alexandrine bird we bought was healthy and playful.
I highly recommend her store for her bird supplies as well as her well cared birds and reasonable prices.

Robin is the bird guru.
She helped me choose the right food for my bird, as we discovered the cheap seed Petsmart was feeding him had made him unhealthy.
And all our questions about his wings, flying, and what kinds of toys to buy were answered.
She cares greatly about her birds and has a great selection, I will only go to Robin for my bird needs.
