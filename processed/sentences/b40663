A couple of friends recommended this place to me, it's close to my house and I often walk past on my way to work.
I firstly did what anyone would do, I sent my mum!
She had her nails done before a wedding and came back with praises.
So this Saturday, I headed with a friend for a massage and shellac nails.
So, downside is, it's not particularly glam, suave or sophisticated.
This bothers me not one whit!
I thoroughly enjoyed the massage (which was done in a curtained area downstairs with my friend in a cubicle next door - not sure how I'd feel about a stranger in the room!
) and would definitely have again.
Nails were lovely and well done too - in a minimal time which was good as we ended up being in a bit of a rush!
The thing that really clinches it, is the price!
It's incredibly reasonable for the excellent services you receive!
Go slightly further into town and you can pay double.
So, I say go for it and head along if you can.

Go in, get your treatment, leave!
That's basically the way of things and exactly the way I like it!
All staff are very pleasant and prices are very reasonable and overall good experience, I would recommend 2UBeauty to anyone looking for threading, facials, nails, massage, waxing, eyelashes, manicures, pedicures, spray tans and more!

Went today to get a pedicure and shellac my nails.
Efficient staff, not the fanciest salon but large venue that offers a huge range of treatments.
Will def go back and look to try other treatments.
Great choice of colours for the nails.
Now do HD brows which are very popular at the moment.
