I've never eaten here and never had a desire to.
My wife insisted, so she won.
The food wasn't anything special, but the customer service was top notch.
And in my book customer service us 80% of the experience.
Plus, my kids dig it too.
Next time my wife suggests it as a fast food option, I won't complain too much.

I feel a little weird writing a review for a concept like Sonic.
I mean, they're effing everywhere!
If you dont know what sonic is or havent been to one, you need to get off the couch more.
Let me start by saying this.
Its fast food.
Theres nothing too special going on here with a couple of small but very important exceptions.
The food, for the most part is unexciting.
Decent burger, ok chili dog.
What sets Sonic apart from the rest is the fact that they have tater tots!!!!
Yes folks, tater tots.
I'll eat their burger just to get to those crunchy, fried tots!
They have an amazing drink selection too.
They're deserts and shakes are on point if you need that late night sweet tooth fix.
So, over the past week, I've seen their commercials for their new line of hot dogs.
I'm a sucker for a good Chicago dog.
So I decided to pop into the local sonic today to give their new Chicago Dog a shot.
I went in with ZERO expectations.
I was blown away!
They serve an amazing Chicago Dog.
Dont believe me?
Check it out for yourself.
Good job, sonic!
You nailed it!

Go for happy hour and try out a tasty beverage.
I'm a vegetarian so I never get a burger.
But its still most definitely worth a trip when you're craving a cold treat!
