Dr. Gundermen is the man!
He is the only Chiro I have ever been to that I enjoy 100%.
You get a nice massage before the adjustment.
You get asked questions.
Get to ask questions too.
Dr. Gundermen explains everything and tells you what's wrong.
Very friendly and affordable.
They even give you free visits after going in so many times as well as for your birthday or referring people.
These guys rule.
As long as they are open and we are in QC I will be going to them.

I love going to the Chiropractor.
I love the massage.
I love how I feel better after the adjustment.
Dr. Gunderman is great.

This is one great chiropractor!!!
In the two months I've been going to him, the range of motion in my neck is greatly improved from adjustments from other previous chiropractic care.
The office is well run, everyone is friendly and wait times are minimal.
You won't be sorry if you go here!!

I have only been to one other chiropractor to compare but Dr.Gunferman and his staff are the best!
Nice relaxing massage and good exam before adjustment.
I won't go anywhere else again!
