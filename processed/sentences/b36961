This is one of the newest Goodwill stores.
It's pretty big and has a lot of stuff with more coming in daily.
There's almost always some color tag on sale, they have a senior day and one Saturday a month everything in the store is 50% off--yay!
It's pretty easy to get to, just south of 202 on Arizona Ave., and has a huge parking lot.
We usually combine it with trips to the Goodwill at Alma School and Ray Rd.
and the Savers just up Arizona Ave.
They all have pretty nice merchandise, especially in clothing.
I buy yarn there when ever they have it, too.

Goodwills are hit and miss you really have to shop them consistently if you have a list of things you want to find at cheap prices.
Personally I love the 1/2 price Saturdays (twice a month) and 1/2 price color tags each day of the week.
There are so many unique items at Goodwill.
I will always shop here.
Happy hunting!
