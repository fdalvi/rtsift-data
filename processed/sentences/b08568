Very cute store.
Nice selection of children's bedding.
Can be a little pricey but worth it for the high quality.
Children are welcome in the store and they even have a little lego play area to entertain the kiddo's.
Staff is very helpful.
Highly recommend if you are looking for a nice variety of quality bedding.
I was looking for something new for my son's room and the Dr. Suess bedding is just awesome!
They do have additional products as well for sell such as furniture, books, backpacks, & bath items.

I ordered furniture from here and it arrived in mis-matching white.
I was very upset but the girls at the store took very good care of me.
It did take some effort and time but in the end I happy with our furniture.
They went above and beyond to correct the issue.
I would definitely return for future purchases since they stand behind their products and service.

Just FYI, this is closing July 6th.. Atleast you can save the 40% off clearance prices while items last.. the new PBK will open at Kierland Commons shortly after.
