I must be the king of first time reviews, hahahahaha.
Anyway, Rock Spa, what a kick ass place.
For one, it's in the Hard Rock, where you're bound to see a celebrity or two.
I've ran into a few in the spa, but I'm not here to name drop.
What's cool about this place is that if you reserve treatments, you are allowed to use their gym anytime during the day you book your appointment.
This can be before or after the services.
It's a small, intimate style gym, but that's why I like it.
You're not going to run into "rif raf" hahaha.
It's reserved for guests of the hotel, people that booked treatments, and the rich and famous that have memberships.
I've always been treated like a celeb when I've gone, so I'm sure you will too.

This place was Awesome.
I don't remember the name of my therapist, but I really did enjoy my "RockStar" treatment.
She was friendly, but it was more polite than genuine.
This is the only reason for the 4 stars.
I would have given 4.5 if it was an option.
I did expect the area to be much bigger from the pictures, but was not disappaointed one bit.
We went on a Friday around 11, and the place was empty, which is so nice, because you feel like you have the entire place to yourself.
