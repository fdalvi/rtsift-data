Today, when I hiked from Club Fortune Casino to the River Mountains, I rested here for a couple of minutes.
The park is placed on six acres at Magic Way and  Pounds Way.
It is contiguous to a paved neighborhood trail and across from Equestrian Park, where I was bound.
Saguaro Park is a nice community park.
I would not drive out of my way to go here.
In the time that I spent here, I especially enjoyed the open grass area, vistas of the River Mountains, and the proximity to open space.
If you would like to check out Saguaro Park, these are the amenities listed in the City of Henderson Park and Recreation website:     *Barbecue grills    *Basketball courts    *Open grass area    *Picnic tables    *Covered picnic area    *Playground    *Splash Pad    *Walking course.

Nice little hidden park.
I like it because its got a playground and a splash pad in close proximity (easier to watch the kids), a covered largish picnic area, bathrooms, an open field and walking trails, and its rarely crowded.

Nice local park.
Clean and grass is well maintained.
Small splash pad in the summer months that runs.
Also small basketball hoops which I always see teenage boys playing.
I like to walk my dogs here.
They have doggie bags avail for use as well.
