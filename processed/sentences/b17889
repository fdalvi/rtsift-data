Great little wine store up in NLV.
Interesting wine selection and great service.
I've been here at least three times so far, and every time I've walked away with what turned out to be a good bottle of wine I'd yet to have.
They also have wine tastings, although I've yet to go.
I believe it's on Thursday evenings, but call to check.
(Edit: The map that comes up with this address looks wrong, FYI.
It's in the strip mall at the southeast corner of Centennial and Aliante, next to Sushi Tachi.

Nice little shop that specializes in boutique wines that are very cost friendly.
Very open, very nicely displayed.
Proprietor is very knowledgeable and friendly.
Unlike, say, Marche Baccus, you don't have to dodge dinner patrons or dust bottles to find labels.
And quite a bit better selection of craft wines.
Unlike Lee's, he has small labels to describe each wine and a good food pairing.
If you ask questions you get informative answers, as opposed to people who don't know or care about the products offered.
The most impressive aspect is that he specializes with high quality wines at affordable prices.
There are more expensive wines available, but the concentration is on rare labels and less on trophy or big name wineries.
You won't get two-buck-chuck or Gallo, but in the $15-20 range you can't touch the selection.
Ask about the rewards card and the tastings.
Nice little bonuses.
And if you find something you like, at these prices, grab a few bottles.
They go fast.

what can i say... its a nice little wine shop, with an interesting wine selection.
HOWEVER... while i love wine, i do not know a lot about it.
so if the people behind the counter asked me if i needed help (i was there for a good ten minutes, browsing), i would have spent some big bucks.
instead, they chose to discuss robert duvall's talent.
let's just say, i'm a bigger fan of the actor then the store.
to the owner(s): more emphasis on customer service!!!
ugh.
