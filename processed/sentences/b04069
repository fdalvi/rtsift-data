When I was in extreme pain Dr. Lubitz was the only person to relieve it.
I wish it was closer to Avondale.

If you are looking for relief from back pain, headaches or whatever it may be look no further!
He has helped me tons.
Dr. Bruce is the best & is very practical in his approach.
All done without drugs & completely natural.
Highly recommend you see him!

I've had a bad back for years, from an old sports injury, and it acts of fairly frequently.
This last time I simply couldn't shake the pain and I decided to visit Dr. Lubitz based on his other positive Yelp reviews.
After two visits I was feeling nearly back to 100%.
Since that time, I've continued to visit him 2-3 times per week and most of my back issues are gone.
I'm sleeping better than I have in years, plus I have more energy.
The doctor is kind and compassionate and doesn't mind staying late to accommodate my work schedule.
Great find!
