They went out of their way to find a shoe for me at a different store in the size I needed.

It is payless.
I was desperate to find inexpensive "fancy-looking" shoes for my son who had a concert in school.
We were greeted promptly, helped by the young girl in charge.
We found what we were looking for un less than 5 minutes.
Good service.
