My company uses this Enterprise on a weekly basis.
We need a car each Tuesday, Wednesday and every other Thursday.
Since October, they have been on time only twice.
When they are late, our schedule is affected and we must use our own vehicle.

Picked me up, not a selection of cars at all, and very slow

I rent from enterprise all the time.
I just wasn't feeling the customer service love so I split & hit another enterprise.

This was an office in the Frys Grocery center and it is empty now.
Far right storefront, next to Great Clips.
Makes me wonder if some of the reviewers got it mixed up with the one further down Baseline or if they just came here before it closed.
