Great complex overall.
We lived there for close to three years and would have stayed if they hadn't hiked the rent up with a new management team.
Very good location very close to freeways and although they do attract ASU students and there is an occasional party things were very peaceful and a pretty ideal clean community where we knew all of our neighbors, and most of the management knew us by name.
Would have gotten five stars except a few issues to be aware of;  If available get an upstairs unit.
Maybe our upstairs friends were just minotaurs but the ceilings don't seem well insulated and often we could hear their children getting rambunctious during the evening.
Never loud enough that it was too bothersome just slightly annoying after a while.
In the three years we were there the hot tub seemed to only have worked for about 2 weeks.....in July.
Everything else was taken care of an fixed very quickly but maybe that was just their Achilles heel....we barely used it but still would have been super nice during the cold winter months.
Overall this place is very good but priced slightly higher than some other comparable communities.....maybe its because of the proximity of the villagio, or maybe it is because they can get away with charging a bit more.... either way we were not unhappy paying that type of rent because everything was safe and issues got taken care of.
There are better communities and there are much worse overall we wish we could have justified staying....wait for the good move in deals we ended up with a great one which made the price difference well worth it.

DO NOT lease from here.
Sent me to collections before even coming to me about the issue.
Received the large collections notice four months later and the day before my wedding.
I sent multiple emails and never heard back from management after I moved out.
BEWARE of scumbags
