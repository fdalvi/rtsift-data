They did a great job in cleaning the poop in my backyard.
Would have gave them 5 but was quoted to come between a certain time and didn't.
But they did a good job.

I am THRILLED with my Dog-Poopy service!
We live in the Spring Valley area (89146) and they come every morning.
I wish I would have signed up for this years ago.
My only complaint?
They come around 5am...
Which wakes up my dogs...
Which wakes me up... Thankfully, I fall asleep quickly.
I would totally recommend this service a friend!
