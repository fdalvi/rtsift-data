This was a clean hotel in the Greenway Station area of Middleton.
It had easy access to downtown Madison and even though we didn't spend any time in the mall area - it was nice to know there was a place to get coffee the morning we left.... with major hangovers.
The service at the front desk was extremely welcoming, and our room was spacious and comfortable.
I did find a long black hair in the shower that I wish was not there...   Good price.
Easy parking.
Would stay again if downtown hotels were booked.

A more than acceptable place to stay in Madison, and there several points that I liked.
1)  The room is nice.
It feels more like an apartment than a hotel, because FOR A CHANGE, the bathroom is located near your bedroom.
When you wake up, you pass your sink, jump in the shower, and a quick 180 degree turn from your sink is the closet.
It's a refreshing design that makes you feel at home, instead of having to go all the way to your front door.
2)   There is a pretty spacious kitchen in each room, with a microwave, fridge and sink.
I'm not really sure people want to cook a meal in their hotel rooms, but I were the kind of person that wanted to reheat restaurant leftovers, or microwave popcorn, this setup is ideal.
3)  A breakfast buffet is included, and they rotated the food every day!
It was shocking, in a good way.
One day was breakfast burritos, the other day was eggs benedict, and yet another day was a egg McMuffin kind of breakfast sandwich.
I never saw the same food twice, and I liked how juice, coffee and water were all self-service.
If I want another orange or cranberry juice, I don't necessarily have all day to wait to find one.
I'd rather just get it myself.
This Residence Inn is convenient to shopping and a few restaurants, and I would gladly stay here again!
