love this place.
fair prices (pedicure starts at $20), nice people, great work.
my feet are always pretty when i leave.
the service is relaxing, but not luxurious.
i'm pretty hard on my poor feet: camping, hiking and refusing to wear shoes at home and even with all that abuse my pedicure consistently looks great 3 weeks later.
strange location between an ace hardware and a auto parts store.
i'm not an appointment kind of girl but they don't seem to mind - i never have to wait long no matter when i stop by.
4 stars.

Very clean salon.
Very courteous staff.
Great manicure and pedicure.
Even willing to speed up my appointment because I had to leave at a certain time.
