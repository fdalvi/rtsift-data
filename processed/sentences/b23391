Came here looking for a new keyboard and mouse for my PC, preferrably wireless.
The employee who helped us recommended the perfect keyboard and mouse!
At first, I wasn't too sure this fancy wireless set would be compatible with my old PC, but the employee insisted it would.
I got home to see if it would work and voila!
It works amazingly!
This employee was extremely helpful and super nice!
I would definitely recommend this Office Max to a friend.

Lots of good highlighters and pens to choose from -- I'm sold.

Decent selection and prices but not enough staff if you need help.

Good and fair prices compare to Staples and OfficeDepot.
Much friendly employees too.
