My wife and I had dinner there this past Saturday.
The place issued a Wagjag coupon, and we were anxious to use it.
We were NOT disappointed.
My wife had the orange chicken, which was delicious.
I had the hot and sour soup (really good) and the pad thai.
The pad thai is amazing!
We also had some delicious spring rolls with dipping sauce.
We definitely intend to go back.
The service was also excellent.
Not a lot of customers yet, though judging by the number of people who just got takeout while we were there, it appears to be getting more and more popular.

We also had a WagJag and it paid off handsomely !
A pleasant surprise...some of the best Tom Yum Goong soup I've had in the city and it's a good sized bowl for less than five bucks.
Fresh, fresh everything...try it out before everybody and their brother starts showing up...Oh!...Lunch combos for five or six bucks...outstanding...OK I'm done.

Definitely a good place for some viet/thai food.
Very friendly staff.
I've ordered from here many times and the food is always consisent and yummy.
Reasonable prices.
I've ordered pad thai, orange chicken, thai basil, pho and shanghai noodles.
All delicious.
