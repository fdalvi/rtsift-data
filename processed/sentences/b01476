I been a client of Dr. Larsen and staff at Shea Chiropratic for nearly 13 years.
They have done wonders for my back and neck, and their treatment plans are reasonable and affordable.
Most insurance is accepted, and they will often work with you if you need help with payment options.
State of the art services, yet friendly and homey atmosphere.
If you need a good adjustment, consider Shea Chiropractic Clinic, PC at 32nd and Shea Blvd.
in Phoenix (just off the 51).

Dr. Larsen is wonderful!
He is extremely professional and a wonderful Dr!
I would highly suggest him!

This is not your assembly line come back 10 times a week because I want to milk you  for all your money chiro.
Dr. Larson listens and adjusts accordingly

Dr Larson at Shea Chiropractic can really get you straightened out with a minimal amount of visits.
I was referred to Shea Chiro over 5 years ago by an associate.
I am so glad to have such a great place in our neighborhood.
I know people that drive all the way from Goodyear to use there services.

Glad to see so many people feel the same about Dr. Larson.
My husband and I have been going to him for years, for regular "maintenance".
