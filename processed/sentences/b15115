Great shop, honest, use good parts, high quality work!

If you want your car fixed right, with good parts, with no "up-selling" of fluff services for a fair price this is your shop.

I will only take my vehicles to Kitchell's Service Dept., regardless of what is needed.
From basic oil changes to complete engine diagnostics and major work, they are equipped to handle it and will do it.
Unfortunately, their service isn't available for everyone, you have to be within a certain square mile radius of them, but fortunately, my office is less than 5 miles away.
They even drop off and pick up.
They have great, experienced mechanics and their customer service is above and beyond.
They not only know what to look for, but they provide options for fixes.
They are also fast and honest.
Aaron and his team are the best.
If you are lucky enough to be near them, I highly recommend trying them out with your vehicles!
