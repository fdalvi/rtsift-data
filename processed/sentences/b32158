Other Auto shops need to go to these guys and take lessons!!!
I went here with my son to get his car repaired....oil change and serpentine belt changed....first off...they have a special for the holiday ALL WORK HALF PRICE......and second...the did the work wihtin 15 minutes.....they were clean...mannerly and  helpful.....VERY KNOWLEDGABLE...other questions about the car were answered intelligently.
From the manager to the ladies in the office...THESE GUYZ ROCK It out!

Safe auto quickly diagnosed and repaired my car without a problem.
They're honest and try to save all their customer's money.
The best part is that they warranty most of their work for a year!
Very friendly, great service.

Very good and " HONEST" mechanic shop which is really rear this days.
Nice staff and trustworthy.

I came here for the advertised $12.99 oil change.
I didn't stay to wait, but went to the Chinese restaurant next door for lunch.
I cannot speak as to how long it took.
Upon returning, the desk worker told me I had to speak with the mechanic.
The mechanic then informed me my coolant was low and my air filter needed to be replaced.
He wasn't particularly confident in the upselling, and kept looking to the desk clerk for support.
I'm not quite sure why I had to speak with the mechanic if the clerk knew all of the information.
While the mechanic was showing me the air filter, he poked a hole in it with his finger.
I was reluctant to have it replaced as it was an easy repair to do myself, but after that I refused.
I did it in the Walmart parking lot for $5 less.
As for the oil change, it was lacking.
The sticker most facilities place in the upper left corner of your wind shield was missing, and the oil change light on my dash was not turned off.
I will have to remember to change the oil at 163,600 miles.
This seems like a good enough spot to leave myself a note.
They probably changed the oil though, I hope.

I'd give them more stars if I could!!!
This place not only had the BEST service in Vegas, but had the BEST PRICES too!!!
I had to do an entire motor swap on my civic, and if you're into cars you know that if a Shop wants to milk you for money they will quote you by the hour from anywhere from 9-14hrs of work and not even gaurantee that there wont need to be any other work done.
This place was able to give me a discounted price from the hourly rate of $100 and completed the ENTIRE engine swap in 4.5 hours!!!
This place/staff does not want your money- They actually care about your safety and want the best for you and your car.
Even after giving me a discounted labor price + Speedy Service + Excellent Customer Service from Management and Front Desk(So sorry I forgot your name, but I believe it was Brenda?
or started with a "B" at least) I told them I would be driving all the way back home to The Bay Area in Northern CA, and they called the next day to check in on me to see if I made it back safely; i was delayed on my drive but made it back a few days later... 2 weeks have gone by and they called again today just to check and see if I made it back home safely, and if my car was running fine.
I've got to say, I've never been to a shop(esp in Vegas) that was not money hungry, and still gave the best service!!!!
This is my new mechanic shop when I am in Vegas hands down!!!!!!!!!!!
So if you're looking for: Cheap, Fast, Quality, Non-Money Hungry, Genuine Mechanic Staff this is where you NEED to go!
I def.
will continue to spread the word to all my friends in Vegas as I did grow up here!
Keep up the great work guys; and Thanks to Management 'Eder' for the fast service and great price!!!!!!
You guys will see me again when my car needs service.
I hope this review helps you guys out with traffic flow :)

Great service, fast, reliable, and competitive in pricing.
Family oriented and very helpful.
I recommend this repair shop often to friends and they are also satisfied with the staff and services provided.

I called this shop and asked for a quote to replace the front crank seal on my 5.9 Cummins engine.
They quoted me 175, the next morning I brought it in and they raised the quote to 450.
Allegedly the tech I talked to didn't know that I was bringing in a diesel truck, even though Cummins only makes diesel engines; so I probably didn't want him working on my truck anyways.
The real shady part though is the alleged 7 hours of labor the tech said he needed to do the job.
I looked up the labor time for the job and it only calls for 3 hours.
Even a full price shop down the road quoted me a hundred dollars less than the so called "half price" auto repair shop.
So basically my experience with this shop is they tried to scam me.

This place should be called Scam Auto.
I took my car for a check engine light.
That said it was the head gasket do i ent ahead and asked to fix.
After more than $2000 i got the car back and it was worse than when i took it in.
Check engine still on, oil light on and car running like crap.
I went back and said it was the oil pump.
I asked them to do it.
I got the car back and still the same.
They decided that didnt want to work on it anymore, i asked for the owner and 3 different names were given but they didnt know his phone number.
I asked for my money back and they called the police on me.
The funny thing was that the police officer said that they are always called at this location.
They gave info to put them in the BBB.
I got an incident report against them and im in the process of taking them to court.
They really suck!!

This place is a rip off.
They take advantage of young women who know nothing anout cars and tell you it's one thing.
Then when you pick up the car they tell you that they noticed something else needs work.
Then when I drove the car it was making a noise that it never did prior to me taking the car to them.
I take it back, they fix something else and again break something else.
They did this to me 3 times over a month period of time until I got fed up and told them they didn't know what they were doing.
I asked them to give me my money back and they laughed in my face, gave me my keys, and told me to take them to court.
Long story short, I found an honest mechanic who told me that the initial work they did for me was under warranty and they should have told me and never touched it to begin with.
Secondly, when they took parts out to fix the initial problem, they put most of the parts back wrong and with the wrong screws, wrong timing, and not to manufacturer recommendations.
I was not a bit surprised.
They are scammers and I filed a BBB Complaint, have contacted channel 8 and 13 news, several consumer advocacy groups, and will take them to small claims court.
I am also going to try to get their licensed pull as well.
Don't go to them, it is not worth the hassle unless you want the guessing mechanic game.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE the staff here!
I especially love Bertha (front desk staff) and Ryan (our main mechanic).
They did their best to address any issue and were always ready to answer any questions I may have.
Very professional and they have gone above and beyond for me and my little beast of a car.
They don't try to oversell you and will work with you to make sure that all of the necessities are taken care of.
Repairs done on my '97 Camry Axle replacement, timing belt, wheel bearing  I needed to get my fuel damper changed and I had mistakenly bought the fuel pressure regulator.
They were patient with me and waited for me to return the next day with the correct part.
Ryan finished the work but it wasn't sealed because it was missing a washer.
He lent me the company car so I can get to work and called around town for the part.
Needless to say, the got my car up and running for my big trip to California.
I am very satisfied with their work.
Only think I don't like is that they charge a LOT for parts.
If you bring your own, the: work isn't covered under the warranty but these guys do the job right the first time so I'm not too concern.

Cheap place...like all shops ..they have good days and bad days!!!!
Always be careful.

It was a pleasure doing business with safety auto care bertha the manager explained to me all of my options I ended up saving a great amount of money and they completed the work in a timely fashion I certainly will be back  thank you safety auto care Richard

These guys used to be my favorite auto shop.
Their techs now just aren't up to par.
I got my car back with a vacuum hose unplugged and a sensor with a broken clip.
Not to mention a computer got stolen out of my car.
The girl at the front desk (Bertha) is very nice and attentive, the new sales manager Ray seems like a nice guy.
But their mechanics are not knowledgable, and have lately caused more damage than good to the vehicle it seems.
I probably won't be returning since I had to fix my car after they "fixed it".
If I do and have a different experience I will update the review.
It's sad since I have spent thousands here and would usually gladly refer them.
