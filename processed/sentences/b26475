An excellent store.
Let's face it most GNC stores being equal the staff and service makes the store.
Adam and Rashan here are knowledgable and work overtime to give thoughtful service and advice.
If you have to, travel a little further to go to this store.

good store feel comfortable asking questions about different supplements.
good selection on  vitamins.

I don't always go to GNC or any nutrition store for that matter but lent and training had me wasting away.
Since muscle atrophy isn't my goal, I had to make an emergency stop here while I was in the area.
The girls that worked the day I came in were helpful.
They were honest about the products and didn't try to sell me other things I didn't want/need.
My friend warned me about his experience about people trying to sell him supplements he didn't need.
They offer a gold card you can use for discounts/benefits that expire a year later.
It's $15 for the card but it saved me $60 so it paid for itself.
They have blender bottles, water bottles, protein shakes, protein powder, pills, chews, liquids for all your nutrition/supplement needs.
They have free samples of certain items so you can test it before you commit.
