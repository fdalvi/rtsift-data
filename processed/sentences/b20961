My Aunt Gladis used to say, you know a good car shop by the great selection of air fresheners.
So on good authroity let me assure you, this is a good one.
They have aot of bits and bobs that I'm sure make your car perform better (furry dice!
) and it won't cost you the world.
I've been told you can get cheap oil here.
Not a big car guy but if I was I would come here.

I know these guys.
Peter, Duggie & Alister .Their garage has been on Leith Walk for over 50 years .Originally started by their dad.. Best place in town for help and parts for  your older car.Can be in here for half an hour chatting before getting round to buying anything.
