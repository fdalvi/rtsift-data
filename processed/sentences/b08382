Nice pool, there were lots of older kids playing basket ball and driving off the diving board.
Pool chairs were great but at 3;00 on a week day this pool turned ghetto!
The teenage kids were using bad language and it seemed like the place for the hood rats to hang out.

Night swim is great for families!
I like that it is small, not over crowded.

This is a small pool but good enough for my toddler!
I signed her up with some basic swimming class and  I really think they have some great instructors like DJ, she learnt a lot within the 2 weeks, 8 sessions class.
I continue to sign her up in another class, the current instructor is equally GREAT too.
After the class, she usually play in the baby pool and easier for parents to keep an eye on their kids.
Unlike the Hamilton Aquatic Center which I also signed her up on weekend class, the instructor P doesn't seems to know how to teach...
If you're looking for Toddler/kids friendly pool cum great instructors, I would recommend Folley Pool.
