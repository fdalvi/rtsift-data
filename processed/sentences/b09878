Great place.
Pool tables, music, great service.

Went  a week ago on a saturday night they had great old school music that night and the prices on the drinks are great.
Can't wait to go again.

PPlace is awesome... price .
service .
and ppl... all great

I used to love this bar when they had karoke!!
we went on a sat night and it looked as if it were a week day it was so dead.I hear there's a new owner which kinda explains the drastic changes.
Thats not the bar i remember at all!!
A bar should be full of people & have some good ol" loud music.
I hope they give karoke another shot or at least a D.j.
Not sure im going back again!
:(   Romans oasis in the far west valley is were I'll go from now on!!!
