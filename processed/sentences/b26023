I went there to get a manicure and a change of polish on my toes.
The manicurist called Nancy did a fantastic job.
She took her time with me.
The place is clean and smells good (even though one of the manicurists was doing gel nails).
Right before I left, Nancy gave me her card and a warm goodbye.
I will definitely be back!

KC always does a great job.
she takes her time and makes each nail look 100% perfect.
I always love my nails every time I go here!

Got a fresh set of white tips and spa pedicure and couldn't be happier.
I finally found a place I will regularly be returning to.
Nancy did a fantastic job.
The place is nice and prices are good.

I have been searching for a new salon since my move in May.
After trying several salons with mediocre results I tried J Nails which just happens to be right around the corner from my house.
I couldn't be more pleased with my nails.
I got white tips and they look fantastic!
Went almost three weeks before I needed a fill for my second visit.
Ask for KC, she was awesome both times.
