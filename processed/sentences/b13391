I feel like no one works here because I spent 15 minutes walking around to see if someone could help me look for something.
All I saw were cashiers and one guy who helped out everyone.
Just one.
The supply area wasn't very organized either.

Today I went to this location as well as the location at Arizona Ave. to pick up school supplies for my kids.
THIS location was very well staffed and I was easily asked 3-4 times if I was finding everything I needed or if I needed any help.
Really great service and the place was very well organized - yes, I was finding everything I needed, everything that was in the back-to-school ad.
Prices were comparable and often cheaper than Walmart next door.
A successful back-to-school shopping experience, especially with the $5 off a $30 purchase coupon, teacher's discount and $2 per old binder discount when buying a new binder.

Steph was a really great help with a rebate deal today.
She helped us and kept a happy attitude throughout the transaction process.
