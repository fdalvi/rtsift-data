I've been volunteering at this rescue for about a year, and I can vouch that this is a great place to find a pet or bring your family for a visit.
It's true that they don't let visitors antagonize the dogs (as that terrible reviewer Kamryn W tried to do).
But they do let people visit with the animals, take them on walks, and really get to know an animal before making a lifelong commitment to them.
They even let you bring your dog to meet the rescue dogs, so you can be sure a new dog will get along well in your household.
There are a lot of dogs and cats at the rescue, all available for adoption.
The animals get adopted pretty quickly, so you can see a lot of new animals every time you visit.
Plus, they do a great job keeping the facility clean.
It doesn't smell bad or feel like a sad place to visit.
This is one of the best rescues in the Valley.
It's a great place to find a new pet, and a great place to volunteer.

Love this place!
Everyone is great and they are all concerned about the well being of these animals!
A fantastic place to find your next Furever Friend!

Super friendly staff that really try to get to know the animals to make sure they find they perfect forever home.
I highly recommend this rescue to anyone that is looking for that perfect addition to their family.
I know that if it wasn't for Furever Friends we would have never have found our Eve.
Thanks again for everything and keep up the great work!

I absolutely love the staff at Furever Friends Rescue!!
We adopted the sweetest kitten from them last Sept.
Unfortunately he passed away in March from an unknown disease causing him to not produce red blood cells any more... we were devastated, but the staff has really helped with our healing.
We are now looking for another little boy to adopt, and are even going to volunteer with them soon!
They are really caring, and desire each precious animal to have a good home.
Thanks Furever Friends for what you do!!
