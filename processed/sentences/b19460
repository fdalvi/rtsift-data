Two walls from the front to the rear of the store front are covered with rows of frames from Versace, Burberry, Gucci, A/X, Prada etc (no Coach) to other lower end styles.
I visited 2 other eye wear stores on Bell and The Village had the biggest selection of styles.
With a ceiling to floor glass front, the store was infused with lots of natural light.
I also liked the many different mirrors--framed, unframed, portrait--positioned so you could check out various options without having to search for a mirror.
The staff were extremely helpful, researching different color options for a few frames I liked.
They didn't exert their unwanted opinions about style selection or try to talk me into buying a lot of additional crap.
I just rec'd my glasses, less than 2 wks after I ordered them ; )  And they told me to return anytime, for a free adjustment, if I start to feel the glasses start to slide down the bridge of my nose or feel too tight around my ears after wearing them a bit.
A+ for selection & service!!

Very friendly and knowledgeable staff.
Hard to find top notch service like this in AZ.
Great selection of glasses and very inviting atmosphere.

Staff isnt too friendly until they know you are about to purchase.
Tons of selection!
Lots of mirrors!

I actually had fun while waiting and during my appointment!
Great staff and great doc - love it!!

Great Staff.
Great Selection.
Great Doctor.
I refuse to go anywhere else.
Oh, and they have Macs and iPads.

Great customer service, they went over and beyond to make me a happy client.
They do care about their clients!
Not many business can say that.
Highly Recommend.
