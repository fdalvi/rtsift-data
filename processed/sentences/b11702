My favorite bank.
I've only ever had two problems with them and that's in a 7 year time span.
Two small problems that they resolved with just a visit to their office and a phone call :)  Like I said I have been banking with one Nevada for 7 years now :O I know even I'm shocked :P  I tried wamu, Wells Fargo, chase.
U name it.
But this bank is the best.
But don't take my word for it.
Go find out for your selves I can guarantee u will love it :)

I recently purchased a home and used One Nevada Credit Union for mortgage lending and insurance services.
They were incredible.
I got quotes from several of the big banks and no one could match their rate or their closing costs.
Everyone I dealt with (Roger - loan officer, Karla - insurance services, and Elizabeth - loan processor) were extremely professional and pleasant to deal with.
I could not be happier with the service I received.
I highly recommend One Nevada Credit Union for your banking, lending and insurance needs.
I have had accounts with them since 2001 and have never had a single negative experience.
