This morning we had the grilled breakfast sandwich.
It is large enough that my husband and I split it and the hash-browns were hot with a crispy out side.
We will be having this again soon.

Every place that sells food needs to be rated against peers -- so you don't compare a Jack to a Stratta or anything.
So this place really needs to be pitted against other places, and in particular those in the immediate neighborhood, I think.
This place is great, and probably the best food choice when you're in that area.
In the immediate area, there this, a Taco Bell (or Del Taco, I forget), McDonald's, and Wienerschnitzel.
This place is always the fastest, provides the best food, and generally has the coolest people working there in that they're polite.
One time I went down here and I was starving after having worked a double shift.
I rolled through the drive through and thought I should get enough food for then, plus some snacks for later.
I ordered four tacos, curly fries, and jalapeno poppers AND IMMEDIATELY ATE THEM ALL.
And all of the food was good and hot.
Can't mess with that.

We are from the east coast "N.Y." and we came to Vegas for the first time in May of last year and did the typical Tourist thing.
We got to Exp Jack in the Box for the first time ever and we really liked it.
Its to bad they don't have any of these back home.
Reminded me of old school burgers back in jrhs.
lol Loved it!

The cashier/server was friendly and quick.
The sandwich was well made.
But the coffee was out, both regular and decaf, at 4 pm.
Maybe it's just my luck.
Otherwise I'd give it a 4-star.

Fast and very nice.
