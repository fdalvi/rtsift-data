Same as any Gap.
But beer makes it better.

To my knowledge, this is the only Gap Body in Las Vegas, unless you count the one at the Forum Shops, which is just a section of the Gap store and pretty much just carries underwear.
This one has more selection by far.
The sales associate made the unfortunate mistake of being friendly and helpful.
Sales associates be warned: I DO want your help!
Unless you work at Victoria's Secret.
Then, go away and let me shop for underwear in peace.
Otherwise, I like salespeople.
Can you help me find this in another size?
What about this one?
Can I have a dressing room?
Does this come in other colors?
What else do you have in this fabric?
Yes, please check every other store in the vicinity.
OOH!
I love THAT shirt.
Where is it?
You only have the one on the mannequin?
Yes, please get it down for me.
When I was a sales associate, I loved customers like me, although I understand that not everyone feels this way.
The staff at GAP was very accommodating and had no problem helping out in any way they could.

Comparable to the Gaps I frequent back home, but what did surprise me was how tidy this particular location was.
Not sure whether this was because it was nearing the end of the day or because the huge space was empty except for maybe one other customer, but regardless, I appreciated how easy it was to shop.
Staff was very friendly, knowledgable, and genuinely attentive, but not overbearing, which was also a relief (no one likes employees who don't let you shop in peace or appear irritable when you ask a question).
