Really knows his stuff and is really reasonablly priced!
Without a doubt the best and most honest mechanic I've ever dealt with.

Depending on your vehicle is a necessity, finding a dependable car mechanic is a blessing.
Tim has serviced (and resurrected) my vehicle for years.
His integrity, workmanship and competive pricing cannot be beat!

Tim was professional and very helpful.
He diagnosed my faulty air conditioner and  gave me different price options to help make the repair affordable.
Ultimately, it didn't make sense to replace the ac compressor in a relatively crappy truck, but he did the diagnosis for a reasonable fee and he went out of his way to try to find used parts to make the repair more affordable for me.
I recommend Tim's services and I would use him again.
Also, this business is ran out of a residential garage.
It caught me a little by surprise, but it's no big deal really.
