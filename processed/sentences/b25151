Small, but has everything you need to print, copy, or ship.
Extra star for friendly customer greeting staff.

Had to print a couple resumes, the woman working was extremely nice and super helpful w/ additional questions I had about other printing services

No complaints.
Employees were very polite and helpful.
Very clean.
Of course a little expensive i.e.
10Â¢ for one copy b/w.
