Great place for a hair cut.
Polite, comfortable, nice atmosphere.
Got a great hair cut for a reasonable price.
Will be getting my hair cut there from now on.

I have had a hard time finding someone good to cut my hair.
I have tried many high end salons to no avail.
So, I went to Fantastic Sams, and had Lisa do my hair.
LOVE IT,  over the top happy.
She actually listens to what you want!
And you can't beat the price, $14.00!
I will go back to Lisa again!
