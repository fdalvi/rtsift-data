I read an article in Bazaar magazine once that I loved, that was about women who were grown up and had teenage underwear.
It was so funny and got me thinking about my own lingerie collection.
Yes ladies, its time we match our bra's and panties and invest in what goes under our dresses.
This place is a connoisseur of lingerie's fantasy.
There is every fabulous label that a girl (or boy) could ever want.
Walking along the corridor with my sweetie was enough to make me throw caution to the wind and go inside.
The shop itself is so beautiful, and the selection is perfectly right.
You will spend lots of money inside, but hey, you can't build the perfect lingerie wardrobe without one super hot outfit from this place.

there's nothing bad i can say about this place.
Walked in on a late afternoon to do some shopping while my gambling-addict friend do her thang at the poker table.
the salesperson could and should actually get some sorta "outstanding employee" award because she was just the perfect employee.
she's literally tried everything i pointed out so she actually gave you real feedback about what's really good and what's not worth buying.
you could definitely tell she loves her job.
ended up spending a few hundred bucks buying some really cute stuff for my friend and i. the products were all extremely high quality.
