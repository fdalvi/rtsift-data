I came in just to purchase some eye cream and ended up having a pampering facial..!!
(Had my hair done as well).
If you're looking  to spoil yourself this will be the place.
My brother took his wife to this store and she had a great experience as well, we both recommend a visit here.

This store made my life much easier !
I went to buy a gift for my wife bd and a girl named Anna helped me find the right makeup and hair products.
My wife love this line and I loved the why this girl treat me.
If you ever shoppe at the grand canal Venetian you must stop by this store !

While shopping at the Canal Shops my mother and I were stopped by a very nice young lady at Brilliance.
She had some samples and then had my mom go in for some eye cream sample.
After the application her eyes looked great.
After hearing about the products my mother decided to think it over as they were a little costly ($550).
She was given the full court press to stay and buy right then and there.
That is when she became concerned.
It almost became uncomfortable.
She stood her ground and decided to think it over and possibly come back.
After about an hour I looked at her and noticed that her under eye area was chalky white.
Every place the sample had been put on was this very off putting white paste like substance.
She tried to wash it off in a bathroom but it was like glue.
And her eyes looked worse than before.
So needless to say she did not go back and buy the product.
The whole experience was odd to say the least.
Glad she did not spend the cash on a product that would not work for her.

Warning.
Leave.
This place used high pressure and out right lies to sell the product.
Example two year supply apply once a week directions indicate twice daily.
Free Facial turned about to be another sales in which they tried to sell me more product.
