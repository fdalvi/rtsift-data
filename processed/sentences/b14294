You know that funky, teen boy smell?
And I don't mean funky like Parliament.
I mean funky like, pee-yoo!
Well, when the weather was warm, we stashed our winter comforter in the guest room.
From there, it was occasionally borrowed by our 17 year old.
Now that the weather has finally cooled off, we want it back on our bed.
But ooh ooh... that smell.
Yuck!
The comforter is too bulky to be effectively washed in our machine.
So I started calling various laundries around town, to see who could do the job.
As lit turns out, the fourth place I tried, Clean Livin' Laundry, had the price, location, and hours I was looking for.
Bonus, they were running a 2 for 1 special on bulky items for February.
So I snagged the pet-befurred comforter off our bed too.
The place itself is modest, small, and little on the old side.
But the lady managing the place was incredibly nice, and she did an excellent job on our bedding.
I dropped them off on the way to work, and picked them up on the way home.
Cost, $20.
Both were warm from the dryer, and wrapped in plastic.
When I opened the packaging up, the scent was awesome -- fresh, flowery, and soapy.
And I think they look cleaner and brighter than when I first bought them!
I'm tempted to bring all of our bedding and blankets there, for a fresh Spring cleaning.

My son in law took his military dress uniform in to be dry cleaned but the woman washed it.
Although the uniform did not shrink it caused some very tense moments.
Be cautious with this establishment!

Place sucks.
80% of there dryers are out of order.
The employees are either walking around with no shoes on or have family around.
Very dirty place.
