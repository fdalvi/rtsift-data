1st!

2nd!

3rd!
It has a car wash!
4th!
Has a red box to rent movies!
Not to bad, it also has most of everything that other gas station/convenient stores have!
I usually stop of here on the way to my weekend job!
Get my 5 hr energy drink, diet coke, then I'm good for the night!
The only problem you might have with this location, might be the construction on the 303 fwy.
Lots of traffic at times.

357...
I like it here not because of the gas prices but because of the nice cashier and the cleanliness of this store.
The location is just perfect off the 303 highway.
If you are low on gas you can get off at Bell and go west this little convenience store is in the Albertsons shopping center in clear view of the street.
There is a O Reily's Auto parts next door if you need something for your car and a drive thru Jack in the Box for fast food.

Awesome gas prices and they have a touch less car wash which is actually good!
I would come back for gas and car wash
