Their FB fan page is what actually brought me in to their salon, can't pass up a good discount.
I saw a couple of toe nail designs and I was sold.
My toes have never looked cuter and I am getting so many compliments!
Love it!
My NEW favorite nail salon!

I've been going to You Need Nails & Facials for almost a year.
The owners and staff are very nice and the place is really bright and clean.
I've had a full set, backfills, regular fills and pedicures.
I loved all of them

Waiting is inevitable, I don't mind waiting 25min for a pedicure but these workers are so damn slow.
Took double the time to get a pedicure as I would have anywhere else.
And my feet are not disgusting that you need that much time to work on them, I get a pedicure at least every 3-4 wks.
Also "cut down your nails" means just that, trim my toenails.
It does NOT mean cut so much I start to bleed.
I will NEVER come here again.

Everyone is right about the wait time.
However, I appreciated the time and care that Kim spent on my Mani and pedi.
She was very particular about ensuring that I was pleased w the length, shape, and thickness of my nails.
The attention to detail is what's lacking within most nail salons now so kudos to this awesome SW Phoenix location that's doing business right.
