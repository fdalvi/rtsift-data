Save your time and money and shop somewhere else.
They overcharge for everything and are very rigid when it comes to returns/exchanges.
I bought a Radio Shack brand audio cable, which was defective, and they refused to accept it in exchange for a new cable.
Had I bought a defective cable ANYWHERE else I would have been able to exchange it for another.
I'll stick to Amazon from now on.

Got to this store to pick up the battery the other store was out of.
The staff, she was on the phone (personal) and just talking.
I waited for about 1 min before she was off the phone.
She greeted me and then walked over to grab the battery.
Doesn't seems to be happy to be at work.
=(  Oh well, I got the battery I needed and I was off to install the sucker so it doesn't beep at 3am again!
