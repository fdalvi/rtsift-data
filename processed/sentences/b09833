I love Wendy's very much but the only reason they got 4 stars out of 5 is because sometimes in the evening the window cashier is very rude and even yells at you through the box when you're ordering your food... Look people I get it you're working fast food but if you don't like the job, don't get the job... That is all!

Manager was far from happy to be at work today.
Sewage smell very strong when you walk in and in restroom.
General cleanliness issues.
Trashcans smelled horrible.
While waiting for a fryer to be available, frozen chicken was placed on fryer shelf which had grease buildup on it.

Something simple good food good service fast drive-through easy and easy out driveway Great hot food when it needs to be hot and cold food when it needs to be cold

Wendy's is normally good for fast food.
This store stinks!!
Twice I have ordered items that they were out of.
Once is oops, twice is simply poor management.
What good is an Asian salad without any dressing??
The clerk was rude and didn't care less.
If I had not been trapped in the drive thru I would have left without buying a anything.
I will not go to this Wendy's ever again!!
Next time I want Wendy's I will drive further to a different store.
Most Wendy's in general are usually 3 or 4 stars.
This store gets zero stars, but yelp won't let me enter zero.
The one star is a gift from yelp.

STAY AWAY!!!!!!
This place doesn't even deserve one star.
I ordered an spicy chicken sandwich and the thing was completely RAW.
They probably only cooked it for a minute.
They then gave me another sandwich instead of offering me my money back.
I'm still grossed out from biting into a piece of raw chicken...
