My mother-in-law lives in this area- when we come over for dinner (sometimes 2x a month), we usually go to this busy corner-mart/gas station for flavored coffee (3 or 4 different kinds) with free add-ins- irish creme, vanilla, etc.
(pretty good for pretty cheap- 3 coffees for under $5) or a car wash (buy something, even a sucker, to get a discount).
The car wash is pretty good.
The gas tends to be priced really high, so if we get gas, it's across the way at Shell.
Also should note that this is a very dangerous intersection- always a crash here (evidence of alters in this area), for some odd reason, so just be on your guard if you're in this area.

The people here are so friendly and nice.
I usually stop by to get my 2/$3 Rockstars before I head off to the gym down the street.
They always say 'hi' when I walk in and 'goodbye' when I leave.
Occasionally, the cashiers like to start up a conversation and manage to get a few chuckles out of me.
The gas itself is a bit pricey but it is, you know, a Chevron.. so I can't blame them.
The car wash is a bit annoying though.
The drier at the end of the car wash doesn't dry quite well and leaves spots everywhere.
Other than that, all is well.
Thanks for the hospitality!
