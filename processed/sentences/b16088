Brighton Collectibles always reminds me of a grandma shop for some reason.
I think it's the way it's decorated but the goods inside are mouthwatering.
Yes, I just described handbags as MOUTHWATERING.
I would definitely shop here rather than the locatoin at Caesars.
The sales associates are LIARS at the Brighton in Caesars.
Read my review for an awesome detailed bedtime story.

Walking through the Canal Shoppes I figured there was no way I should be spending money on myself--mainly because it all seemed expensive.
Then I remembered I'd forgotten my jewelry to wear at my corporate conference.
I turned the corner and this beautiful jewelry store just appeared shiny and sparkly.
Figured I'd never be able to afford anything but oh well, I strolled in anyway.
Wow!
Beautiful stuff and doesn't break the bank.
Very classy necklace and earrings but only spend 85.
YAY!
And they have locations in Denver!
Double Yay!
Such a great place to buy a relative or great friend jewelry.
Shoes seem really cute too.
I luv when I find a new store to shop at!

Brighton is a class act.
Their offerings are quality and there prices are in line.
The folks here were a pleasant as could be and even offered me a bottle of water as I left.
My only complaint is that it's tucked back off the canal.
