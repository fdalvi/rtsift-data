Wow, the mailman arrived with another coupon for a chicken lunch at Church's for $1.99!
How cool is THAT?Â¿?
:-))  Ok, so of course I grabbed the car keys & whipped right over here.
This particular special got me a good-sized leg & thigh, a little homemade style biscuit, & an order of fries.
The spicy chicken was great as usual, & the biscuit was good with a little margarine on it.
The fries were just ok, compared to the fast food competition, & I would stay with their mashed potatoes & gravy side instead, given the choice.
This particular store is a small one, with a long skinny dining area of tables & chairs only, no booths.
It's ok, but not particularly inviting, so with so many other fast food choices right here in this center (BBQ, Fish & Chips, Chinese, Jack in the Box & Subway), I doubt I'll be back here for a while.
With that said, you could do worse than this Church's at 35th Ave. & Southern.
It's really quite "A-OK!
"     :-)

Bring on the bombers they are .... Well the bomb!!!

As noted on my last visit, this particular Church's isn't one of my favorites, but I come here because I go right by it on frequent errand runs from my house nearby, here deep, deep in the ghetto.
:-)  So I stopped back in here today armed with one of their great coupons for a (Spicy) leg & thigh, mashed potatoes & gravy, and a drop biscuit with margarine.
(I think they have honey too, if you want it.
)  Here's how it was this time:                                                                                                                                                          POSITIVES...  * Convenient location in the Walmart Center.
:-)  *  Big, delicious thigh & leg, cooked just right & served hot.
:-))  *  Amazing value at $1.99 for everything!
:-))                                                                                                                                                          A FEW NEGATIVES...  *  Air blower only to dry hands; no paper towels.
Must use TP to open the door.
:-|  *  Good music, but playing too loudly.
:-O  *  I like my women long & skinny, but not my dining rooms, such as this one.
:-)

Came in here and it was pretty busy.
Two customers in front of me were upset at the service.
I understand why.
These ladies were on their phone, making fun of their customer's with complaints in clear sight- i had ordered two spicy chicken and they gave me plain.
I came up to tell them and they were on their cellphones.
LOL management where art thou?
Unprofessionalism to it's finest, talking ish in spanish.
