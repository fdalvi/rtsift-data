This is one of the better filibertos locations out there

I know its quick Mexican foods but it is pretty good and really reasonably priced.
Love this location which is just around the corner from my house.
Great 99Â¢ specials every day of the week except Sunday.

Each time I have been here the food is great for a quick Mexican restaurant.
I have always gone thru the drive thru which I wish the service was a little faster but I always know I get a great breakfast burrito!
Staff has always been nice.

I have visited this establishment 4 times in the last 3 weeks, and that's only if you count the first time I visited the establishment each day.
3 out of the 4 times my order was wrong and I had to go back and have them correct my order.
I clearly asked for no beans and identified that it was a food allergy, so it was real important.
Each time I would find beans hidden in my food.
I am very disappointed with this location.
Others that I have been to are pretty good.
I will not be going back after today.
The employees are not even very apologetic when you go back and explain the issue.
Very Poor Customer Service.
