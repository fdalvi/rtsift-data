Pearson Eye Care was recommended by Decot Sport Glasses when I was looking at their prescription safety glasses.
Booked a Sunday exam which really surprised me.
They are in the Fiesta Mall which requires they open on Sundays.
I received a more through exam than expected.
The optometrist checked distance and ran the same process at reading distance.
Also took picture and 3D scan of each eye to look for medical issues and create a baseline record.
This office also offers a specialized exam for gun owners.
It is important to see gun sights clearly.
They have a replica gun to hold while measuring focus on the sights.
I received three prescriptions for daily wear, computer use and shooters glasses.
The doctor discussed what he found in the scans and during the multi part exams.
I was very impressed by the use of technology in the office.
Medical history and insurance info forms are filled out online before arriving for appointment.
They have laptop computers for walk ins to fill in the forms.
Exam results and pictures were sent to my primary physician.
Great experience.

Have been seeing Dr. Wyman at this office for many years for annual contacts exams, and I will never stop going!
The staff are friendly and always get you through the preliminaries very quickly without seeming like they're just rushing you through.
Dr. Wyman is fabulous - very patient and very knowledgable.
Definitely recommend!

I have been visiting this location for a couple of years.
I suggest you check it out!
Thanks.
