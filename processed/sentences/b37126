Chad and the Keepn It Blue staff has taken care of our pool for years.
Changed our system over to Salt water and we are loving it!
Always dependable and available!
Recommend to anyone !!

I have had Chad and his company servicing my pool for the last 12 years.
I don't usually post reviews but feel everyone should know that he is a honest, knowledgeable pool guy and really takes the time to listen to any customer.
He provides the best service I have every had from a pool company.

Keep'n it Blue has been servicing my pool for almost 8 years.
Chad and Co always take the time to not only listen and address my concerns, but also patiently explain what's going on with my pool, in a language I understand.
I am 100% satisfied with the service I receive from Keep'n it Blue.
