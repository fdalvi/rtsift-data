I stopped to get a car wash and gas.
The attendant told me about a special that I first thought was a sales pitch.
Maybe it was, but I got a detail that was one of the best I ever got and my car was like new again.
They were nice, helpful and the price was more than right.
You got it going and thank you.

A great place to get your car washed and detailed!
I stopped by on a recent Saturday afternoon to get my car washed after a couple of days of rain.
It has been a couple of years since I've had it detailed, so I paid the extra $$ to get it detailed and hand waxed.
I also added on an oil change....may as well right?
They told me it would take 2 hours, so I walked down the street to Ernie's to watch a few games and hang out for a while.
When I got back my car was looking like new!
Awesome!
I did pay a lot for it though......the detail, hand wax, and oil change came out to $243....ouch!
It was worth it though....my car is still clean after 3 weeks of dusty desert driving!
Plus it drives faster..... :)  Return Factor - 87%

Very pushy sales people when you pull in.
Today I spent $25.
For a car wash.
I had to call the guys back to my car  twice to have things cleaned that should have been done the first time.
Things like cup holders in the console and no air freshener.
This place does not deserve my business but it is convenient being close to my house.
Remind me NOT to go back.

FYI  This location is no longer a Danny's Family Car Wash.
The closest Danny's are located at Tatum and Cactus, Raintree and Northsite, Scottsdale Road and Greenway.
Nothing wrong with this location, just clarifying.

Not a Danny's car anymore, with Danny's if your a member & they have your plate # in the system.... A basic wash is $6.95!
@ this place $12.
95....
They must use better water.... NOT!
Never again!

The Always do a wonderful job !
A++ service !
Thanks
