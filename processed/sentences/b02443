Busy location, average service & speed.

Service usually sucks.
Two order spots but never used.
Coming in and out is so narrow surprised not more accidents.

the staff is always nice!
I take my dog through the drive thru all the time.
They pet him and sometimes even give him a french fry!
which makes his day.
My orders are always special and they always get it right!

Its McDonalds.
With a playplace.
It was clean.

I had 2 options for water a tiny 6 oz cup (yeah right) or pay full price (cost of pop) for a glass of water.
Customer service is lost on the managers here.
These are the basics and I'm tired of it.

You can expect: cold fries , gross or uncarbonated drinks , cold burgers that have been sitting there ect.
I usually don't write reviews but with flu , fever , and gross food; I'll be going hungry tonight.
Save yourself a trip and go to Ellsworth.
