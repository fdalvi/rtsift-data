Lynsey's comprehensive review has pretty much summed this place up, but I'll give it a bash!
A lot tamer than Whiplash Trash and veering more towards alternative than Cookie, Voodoo cuts a happy medium of alternative without trying to be "emo" (or whatever the kids are calling it these days).
A bit like a smaller scale version of Glasgow's Hellfire, Voodoo stock a number of rockaburley 50s style halterneck dresses from the likes of Hell Bunny and Rock Steady, to name but a few.
As Lynsey has said, they are all about their B-Movies and tend to stock brands who specialise in making such clothing.
They have very bright zombie inspired t-shirts for girls and guys from Iron Fist & Co.  A shop that is alternative without being garish or glaringly self-conscious, Voodoo is worth a look.
Their burlesque dresses are quite bewitching!

Voodoo is the perfect destination for fans of The Cramps and B-52s.
An alternative, unisex boutique, it stocks a great selection of 50s rockabilly dresses, polka dot blouses,  dogtooth shirts, skinny jeans, stripey jumpers and skull prints.
Labels include Iron First, Criminal Damage, Rock Steady, Hell Bunny and Living Dead Dolls and as you'd expect, they stock some fab black and white tees emblazoned with rock and roll bands and old movie stars.
The only disappointment?
There's no poster of Lux Interior and Poison Ivy shredding their guitars and playing 'Bikini Girls With Machine Guns'.
