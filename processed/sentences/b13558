I am going to make this easy.
I have to wear scrubs to work.
They sell scrubs and at a good price.

Horrible customer service!
I'll never go here ever again!
I don't think the employee even noticed I was in the store until I asked her where the fitting rooms were, and all she did was point.
I came out of the fitting room multiple times to get different sizes and fits, not once did the employee offer to help.
I say go to SCRUBS & SCOPES if you're looking for a set of scrubs that fit well and employees who will actually assist you

Extremely helpful and thorough.
I'm not used to having Scrubs made specifically for guys available in store, so it was nice having more stylized choices.
Unisex just doesn't fit me well.
Very happy and will return again.

Horrible customer service and rude employees.
I will never shop at this location again.
I was just wanted to exchange sizes that I had purchased online and it was a nightmare.
I ended up just returning and leaving with nothing.
