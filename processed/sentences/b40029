Dilen Haircuts is a cheap and good hair salon.
Whenever i need a good hair cut, from now on I will go to Dilen Haircuts.
Whenever I go there, I feel relaxed and at ease.
I truly recommend anyone who needs a good and cheap hair cut, color, and perm, I will always tell them to go to Dilen Haircuts.

Dilen has moved from Seattle and is setting up shop here.
She knows a lot about hair.
I had to listen carefully to understand sometimes, but it is worth being patient.
My hair is very long and I am older, so she conditioned it and gave me a lot of wisdom about taking good care of my hair.
The cut she gave me was just like the photo I gave her.
She colored my hair and highlighted it.
I can't believe how much care she gave to my hair.
She really cared about how I looked and made me look the best I have ever looked.
She certainly is a top salonist.
I would recommend her to anyone.

Got a haircut because of the good reviews of the people, must have been her friends.
Didn't get the cut i wanted (Like the picture i showed her).
Don't be fooled.
Maybe thats why there's nobody else there too.
For the price of the cut and style, i could have gone somewhere else for cheaper price.
Trust me, don't do it.
Only good thing about this, she was a nice lady.
But sucks for me though.
