Being a person of color, I understand the difficulties associated with making my hair look good and because of that I have had trouble finding a place to go and get a good haircut.
This place has solved that problem.
My barber had my hair looking pretty good and I was in the shop for only about half an hour.
A great barbershop for blacks in the valley.

Holla at that chick named Joy.
She makes you look like a celebrity.

I've been looking for a shop for a while no one seem to know how to cut hair in Az.
Then I found this place thank God it's was very clean & they where nice to me.
Best hair cut I've ever had!

Racist Place.
I called prior to going down.
I needed a shave and cut.
I'm in a wheelchair and Hispanic.
I went in with my wife and one female barber was LAYING down on a bench.
(can u believe that) another guy cutting hair and another one waiting to cut someone else's hair.
Not one person asked if they could help us, did not acknowledge that we were there for over 10 minutes.
The one laying down kept (huffing n puffing like she was fricken dying) I then asked to use a restroom.... My wheelchair could not get through because if trash piled by the restroom door.
None of the three staff offered to make a way for me to their restroom.
I was insulted.
I could but believe it.
Completely shocked.
They are lucky I did not sue them for not  bring non ADA compliant

Place is not organized, not clean, No sign in Sheet, Just  a hot mess.
Go elsewhere (see my reviews for a barbershop!
)   Not coming back!
Until they get their place together!
