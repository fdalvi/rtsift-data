Great customer service as she helped me find a good gift for fathers day...  Good prices too..

Prices and selection are great, shipping was LIGHTNING quick; what more could you ask for?!?
5 Stars, all the way!
Thanks guys!

Very helpful staff.
Will recommend to everyone, and will definitely be going back.

Pricey, but I've been coming here for 10+ years!!

One of my stand by shops.
A tad too expensive & the counter help is always frosty at best.
I always feel relieved to egress post haste.
