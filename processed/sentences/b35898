Today was my first time visiting K'Bella.
I went to see Anita for a haircut.
I have been following Anita around for about three years so it is safe to say that I am a big fan.
She knows my hair better than I do.
Anita gets five stars.
The rest of the salon is also nice and if I go back for anything else I'll be better able to rate the spa services.
The place it clean, well lit, well designed, comfortable, and when I called this morning to make an appointment someone was there to answer the phone on the first ring or two.
That can be sort of a big deal.
I'll be back in five weeks for another haircut.
Maybe I'll try out another service too and offer another review.

My husband gets his hair cut by the same girl every time and he loves it.
She does a great job, and is super friendly.
Always such a clean place, and I love the shampoo I bought.

Love going here, been a customer even when it was still "guy and gal salon"...cute decor in this salon .
Sunny always cuts and colors my hair going on over 4 years now and even when I move back to phx area I will come here to have sunny cut my hair!

Clean, friendly, love going to this salon!!
SUPER!!

We took our daughter here for a much needed haircut.
They did a great job.
Really nice spot.
Clean and the staff was helpful and friendly.
Great place for both my ladies.

I had my hair cut in late May or early June.
I am not a fan of the service.
However, when I posted this on social media I became bullied to the point I have closed my facebook account.
I even received a threat from an employee or representative of the salon.
I am not posting this in retalation, I just want other people to know my experience and to beware of what can happen to you for having an opinion.
