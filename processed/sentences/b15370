It's a drug store and I've been here tons of times but oddly enough I've never actually used the pharmacy portion.
This is mainly a "Oh man, I forgot I need water/beer/candy/mouthwash/ice cream/liquor/soda/whatever" stop for me as it's on the way home from the 17 to my place in the 'Slope.
I always kick myself for forgetting to go somewhere else as things are usually 30-50% more expensive at a drug store than at a grocery store.
The service is always good but there's typically a huge line and only one clerk.
They're always pleasant though.
What is it with CVS' and Walgreens (always worse than CVS) and ignorant people????
There's always someone in line that wants to argue a coupon for 20 minutes, or lets their small child run around knocking stuff on the floor without comment, or trying to pay with $30 in change?
It's a Walmart microcosm, so always come here expecting to people watch and you'll find yourself more entertained than annoyed.
This location is FAR better than the one farther down Dunlap near Central Ave.
The people that tend to frequent that one for some reason are even odder.

I usually find what i need at this location.
Whether i'm trying to avoid the lines at the grocery store or I'm coming home from work this is open 24 hours.
Pleasant staff that greet you and offer their help when they see you browsing.
Great deals on vitamins and meds for the family.
Usually Buy one get one free.
Well stocked  Clean

Not in the best part of town, especially right now with lightrail construction but it works.
This store has just about everything you can ask for or need.

The pharmacist here are by far the worst.
The wait time is always 2 hours.
And when I ask them for help to find another location that can assist me they say figure it out.
This is especially for the pharmacist wearing all the rose buttons .
There was no reason for you to be rude to me today
