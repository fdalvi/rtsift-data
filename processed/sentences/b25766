You will also get some laughs while you are here to keep you coming back for more.
Highly recommend giving these guys your money because the price will be fair and service will be above and beyond!

I was experiencing a very bad vibration on my 2005 GMC Sierra.
It was lifted and had used wheels and tires put on about 2 years prior, but the shaking started about three months ago.
After rotating and re-balancing the wheels several times with no success I brought it into Chris at XTC to have them check it out.
At first, after several of his team members looked it over they couldn't find anything wrong with it.
After looking up the date codes on my tires Chris discovered that the tires were nearly 7 years old!
He recommended new tires and shocks.
I had them install 4 new Toyo AT/2 tires and 4 new Bilstein shocks.
I can honestly say I have never felt that truck ride so smooth!
What an improvement, and most importantly the vibration was gone.
I really appreciated the time Chris and the other team members took to look over my truck and make the correct suggestion to resolve my issue.
I had been several other places before and was told they couldn't find anything wrong and sent me on my way.
Thank you team XTC for taking care of my truck.
I love to drive it more than ever!
