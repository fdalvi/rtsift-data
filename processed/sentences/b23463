This is some of THE best pizza i've ever had.
Its decently priced, around 7$ for a full large one topping pizza, its perfect for a night after partying when you just need something to eat.

I used to get pizza from here all the time, but recently I've found Twice the Deal to be a better pizza place.
Bianca's offers the same things as Twice the Deal but at a slightly higher cost (also, no dip).
The only thing I like better about Bianca's is their large juicy tomato slices.

Looking for a good pizza at a great price?
Look no farther than Bianca's Pizza.
Bianca's is close to where I work and I have always found the pizza to be consistently good... but the prices are even better: you can get a large three-topping pizza for pick-up for just $9.99 plus applicable taxes!
The pizza is always made hot and fresh, and they don't skimp on the toppings either.
I definitely recommend Bianca's Pizza if you are looking for pizza in the area.

$7 large pizza?
It's a no-brainer.
If you're looking for cheap, good pizza near the universities, this is where you should go.
I used to order from here all the time when I lived around King and Columbia.
I miss it.
