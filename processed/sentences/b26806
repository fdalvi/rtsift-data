This location is clean and friendly.
I always stop here for a quick bite before going to my class.

Love the music here...oldies but goodies.
7-layer always good!
My go-to place before class.
Soft tacos always good.

Great location.
Always clean and the staff is always friendly!

Food is good, I mean its Taco Bell !
But the girls working here RUDE, I can't even enjoy my dinner in peace and quiet with my fianc√© .
They were being so loud and obnoxious, singing at the top of their lungs, screaming across the room to one another.
Did you forget you had customers eating here??
