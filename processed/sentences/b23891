I ordered a teriyaki bowl, to go.
20 minutes later, I was still waiting.
Some people who came in after me had already been served - with the same dish I ordered.
Two people who ordered before me hadn't been served yet, either.
The cashier didn't even offer an apology when I asked for a refund.
She seemed to be on some hell of a drug, or perhaps practicing astral travel while taking orders.
Pretty awesome.

The food always tastes good.
And more than anything, they always serve it super fast!
It is probably faster than McDonald or Burger King.
It has been my favorite place to stop by for quick lunch recently.
The only thing they could improve would be keeping the tables a little more clean.

Pretty good for a quick, [relatively] healthy meal.
I had the teriyaki bowl with white chicken and brown rice, with extra veggies on the side.
The rice was a little soggy and there was a LOT of it.
When I asked how many veggies come on the bowl and was told 3 ounces, I knew I'd want an extra side...for $1.75.
Really?
For over done broccoli and zucchini?
Okay...  My meal came out pretty quickly, and when I got to my office to eat it I noticed they'd already poured teriyaki on top.
The rice was saturated--a little too heavy on the sauce for me.
It was tasty, but not the best chicken teriyaki bowl I've had.
Samurai Sam's is good for when I'm not in the mood to pack a lunch for work.
