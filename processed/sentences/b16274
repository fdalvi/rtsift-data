Quick, efficient, clean.
They have a bunch of trucks, a large staff and tons of moving and storage supplies.
All that translates into the best U-Haul rental place I've used in my many years in Vegas.

Was helping my sister move.
Not sure what to expect from a U-Haul.
The staff was friendly and insured I knew everything I needed.
It did take a long time but I would presume it's the nature of the business.

SLOW.
Slow getting propane, and was surly.
slow renting vehicle (took almost an hour).
Tire was low and then needed replacing.
On the upside they took a day off rental.

After getting screwed over by another U-Haul location just a few miles away, this location had the truck ready for us by the time we pulled in.
Outstanding customer service and no hassles.
Good job!

Slow service, staff lacking knowledge .
Staff is more interested in talking amongst themselves then helping customers.
