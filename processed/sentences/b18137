A little known fact is that HoneyBaked Ham sells sandwiches and other lunch-type fare.
Take advantage of this opportunity.
They use their own mouth-watering, thick-sliced meats and really take the deli sandwich to a new level.
I had their classic ham sandwich and it was great.
The ham was fantastic, especially when paired with their dijon mustard (and I don't even like mustard!!).
The loss of a star here is because the bread was a little tough and roughed up the roof of my mouth.
Ouch.
Other than that, it was great and they have a lot of offerings from hot and cold sandwiches, soup, etc.
Check it out, you'll like it.

A great place to eat a good sandwich, this is a franchise and the owner's are extremely friensly, offering up all kinds of taste tests in the minute or two that you are waiting for your food.
I turned my company on to this place and this is now an office favorite when we order food in!
Try the Club sandwich, with the original sliced honey ham...it just feels so right!
