this is the best nail shop in town!
ive been going to this shop for 3 years.
the prices are extremely low for the quality.
i feel like i get ripped off anywhere else i go.

I have to agree with comment below ...
I LOVE THIS PLACE nice good nails and last a while.
I have been coming here for over 15 years and even thou I live so far I still come here.
They do the nails by taking there time I seriously can go a month and half with a full set.
It's good quality and they do a great job plus they love kids and do my daughters names too.
I love it wouldn't go anywhere else.
ALSO there gel nails can last me 2 months plus looooooove it!

Best nail place!
I been coming here for over 10 years now!
It feels like home!!
Great job'!
Moderate price!
I come and it relaxes me!
Their pedi and massage chairs are the best!
I truly recommend it!
They are very nice!
And the work is amazing!
I trust them!
You won't regret it!

The absolute worst nail experience I have ever had !!!
I went for a gel manicure and a pedicure.
Mimi was not pleasant nor friendly, never smiled, no personality.
Then the tools were not sterilized !
And there was no cleaning of my feet with any nice abrasive scrub.
I actually have to go home and work on my feet with my own products and tools.
She finished with a very quick polish and then started my manicure .
I noticed there was polish all around the skin of my toes .
Very sloppy !
Of course I asked her to clean it up which she did .
Then the manicure .
I had a tear in my nail .
Usually don't they just repair it .
Not Mimi .
She was ready to polish right over it .
So I asked before she polishes if she would repair the nail .
She said if you want perfect nails get acrylics !
Miss personality !
I picked a color based on their selections .
Well another horrible experience !
The color looks nothing like the chart she shows you !
My nails are almost black.
She said the sample was only one coat !
Ha !
Even with one coat it was nothing like the color on my nails.
Then she asked if I wanted to start over with a new color .
By this time all I wanted was this experience to be over .
Now I have almost black nails with bubbles .
She didn't even use any moisturizer on my hands when she finished the manicure .
The salon and Mimi are a mess.
I can't imagine why anyone would ever be a return customer .
The salon wasn't busy either .
Lesson learned .
I'll never return and you shouldn't waste your time or money going there either !
