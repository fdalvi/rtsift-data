Dr.
Pulley has the sweetest most genuine demeanor.
You trust him instantly.
Also, Brittany cleaned my teeth so well, cleaner than anyone else has ever done and it wasn't uncomfortable or painful.
He is definitely my new dentist!
Highly recommended!

Today was my first visit to their office.
I have to deal with a problem wisdom tooth.
I still haven't figured out what pain has to do with wisdom.
Dr Pulley also found a few other issues that needed to be addressed, since it's been a few years since my last dentist retired.
I have to say the staff was very pleasant, and they made time for me in their already busy week.
My wife and friends have been using Dr.
Pulley for some time now, and they have all had great things to say about the services.
Dr Pulley performed miracles for one of our friends.
I go back to start the real work in 2 days, so I'll fill in some more later.
