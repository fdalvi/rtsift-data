I'm a big fan of FIB'S - Fine Italian Beef.
The food is great and the cart brings back memories of time spent in Chicago.
The meatball sub is the best I've ever had and a fellow worker, who's a professed chili hot dog expert says that FIB'S chili dog is the best she's had.
I recently found out that the owner of the cart donates to local homeless shelters quite often.
Wonderful !

Very beautiful area with 8+ food trucks during the lunch rush and lots of benches to enjoy your food on!
Surrounded by lovely gothic architecture to look at and tall trees providing shade....it can be a really serene place to relax.
Of course sometimes there are events going on here and a random hardcore religious advocate shouting at the crowd.
