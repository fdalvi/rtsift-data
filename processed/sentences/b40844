Went in to the store to have my phone repaired, due to the screen being cracked they stated I had to pay for a replacement which was $100( my deductible ) I say ok he processes the replacement but states I can't pay cash it must be credit or debit because it's processed by the insurance company.
I stated I only had cash the rude sales agent tells me I need to go get a prepaid card... WTH who says that to a loyal customer I bet if I chose to upgrade he would have been happy to assist me.
Im so tired of receiving poor customer service from these Sprint Stores!!

Horrible customer service.
I walked in with four customers and two employees and it took 20 minutes for anyone to acknowledge me.

This a false representation  This is not a sprint store on the door in small writing it says it is a wireless store They do sell for Sprint They tried to rip me off on the price of the phone by saying I had to make monthly payments They would not let me pay for the phone up front If I would have paid it out a two hundred dollar phone would have been 600  Buyer beware and find a real sprint store the signs on the top say sprint but THEY R NOT SPRINT.
