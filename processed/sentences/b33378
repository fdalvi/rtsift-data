We heard about Jason through a mutual friend.
Not only did we have leaking pipes out in front of our house, but one of the valves there was just about shut and sealed off water from an entire wing of our house.
Jason got right on it and repaired the broken valves we had quick.
He was great to work with and his prices were very fair.
He even gave us a one year warranty on parts and labor.
Before meeting Jason, I called another (apparently highly Yelp rated) plumber about the problem of the water not working in part of the house, and I kept getting advice from them about checking the screens on the faucets or whatever.
Jason didn't give me this BS--he just solved our problem.
Here's another small, local business that I can recommend to you, and I couldn't recommend it more highly.
Got a plumbing problem?
Call Jason.

Nice guy and onetime.
Did my job, new rear yard faucet added at wall.
Cut ex stub out at wall and created new faucet and T FOR NEW REAR IRRIGATION SYSTEM.
WOULD USE AGAIN.
DEFINITELY.
DID JOB BACK IN LATE 2012.
Check out  now for past 2013 work.

Needed help with shower repair.
Cartridge got stuck inside and couldn't get it out to replace.
Called Jason morning, he was here within few minutes and fixed it.
Shower is back to normal and working condition in no time.
Highly recommend!
