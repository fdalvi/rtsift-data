I love QT.
When I was on my mission in Spokane I always wished I could have a slushy or some other beverage but I always had to wait till I got home.
Now I go all the time.
They complete transactions lightning quick and have what I need.
Every store has always been great in my experience.
My only wish now is that they sold diesel.

I LOVE this place!
I'm always right in and out without long lines or any drama.
They are always friendly and the store is always clean!

Nice, clean and friendly gas station.
The gas price is reasonable for which the station is located.
This might be a minor thing but I like is they have free air, which other gas stations charge for $1 just to put in air for your car.
They also got good choices of snacks and drinks.

Always good costumer service and very clean.
Plus their chocolate chip m&m cookies are delicious!
