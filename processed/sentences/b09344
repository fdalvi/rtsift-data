Just came across a stash of Rehab drinks!
Don't get too excited, i got all they had - 9 cans :D Nice employees, had whipped cream which I also needed.
This is a good corner store.

This is a great corner store.
It used to be a little seedier, with bums hanging around and the cashier behind plexiglass, but since they remodeled last summer it's really come into its own.
They now have a more complete grocery isle, and hotdogs and slurpees.
Liquor Express is family owned, with great staff and a surprisingly diverse beer, wine, and spirit collection.
There are very few corner liquor stores where you can pick up a 30 rack of PBR and a 1996 vintage Dom Perignon.

A great liquor store that is right by my place.
I am literally in there every single day either getting some booze or cigarettes.
The staff is very friendly and they are dependable.
Additionally, the sell turkey sub sandwiches for $1.99 and they are actually really good!
They are made fresh daily and taste great for lunch at work or if you are in a pinch.
They also have a large selection of beer that you wouldn't expect from a place like this.
On first glance it appears to be more of a convenience store but they are stocked with a cavalcade of craft beers from Stone Brewing and Nimbus as well as a bunch of other brands I can't think of right now.
If marijuana is your predilection they also sell pipes and accessories at  incredibly affordable prices, better than most smoke shops in the area.
They do sell crack pipes which is probably my only complaint simply because meth and crack are so devastating to both users and their families.
However, I can't blame them for selling a product that has a market
