You save lives!
Enough said?
They have a professional staff that are kind and conversational that take you through the whole process.
Since their staff are full time pros and not volunteers I've never had them miss a vein or have to do any significant adjustments or re-sticks.
There is always a need.

I've been donating blood for decades.
It's one of the few morally unambiguous things you can do these days.
In addition, I have many friends who cannot donate for a variety of reasons so I try to take up the slack.
I usually donate at work but, because of the summer, they skipped a cycle so I checked at the ARC to see about walk-ins.
West Madison's ARC center wins the prize for the quickest donation EVER!
Granted, it was slow day over there and I know the ropes but, I was out in 45 minutes!
After quick, friendly and professional attention, I was sipping OJ, eating a cookie and walking out with a free loaf of Panera bread (on Thursdays and Fridays) under my arm in less than an hour.
I won't suggest that you'll get through that quickly but, if you can, donating blood should be a thing.
Do it.
Save lives!
