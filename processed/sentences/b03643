Before you order anything from Body Aware, be aware that they do not take returns!
I ordered a pair of boxers online for my boyfriend, and they're so cheaply made.
At $25, I expected far better quality.
I of course wanted to return them, but I failed to read the fine print on their site - no returns.

I am in love with their swimwear, unique styles for men at a good price compared to the $50 plain board shorts you find in so many shops these days.
They do not have a store front, only a warehouse, but they will allow you to go and pick up your order if you call in first.
I have picked up and I have had items shipped to me.
Shipped orders always arrive very fast, as they are almost always shipped same day, and being local, they usually arrive next day.
They have also updated their terms, and are currently accepting returned on most items.
