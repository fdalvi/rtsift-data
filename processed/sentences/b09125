This place is the best!!
They have better rates than the big banks and they are always friendly and helpful down there.
Also, they don't gouge you with fees like the big banks.
They have no ATM withdrawal fees at any credit union ATM.
Why do  you still do your banking at Chase, Bank of America, US Bank, or any other large bank again???

Decided to go with a credit union over my main stream bank that kept charging me fees for stupid reasons.
Went into this location and had a great experience.
They had my accounts setup and a real usable check card exteremely fast.
My old bank took days and 3 weeks to get my check cards in the mail.
So far so good when you go in ask for Bebe she is extremely nice and helpful.

Love these guys, wonderful, customer service, low rates, reasonable fees.
I see no reason to keep using large, thieving corporate banks when awesome little credit unions like this exist.
