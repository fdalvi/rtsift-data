After the one by my house went out of business and the other one raised their prices sky high.
I have tried this place 3 times and I like them.
Fast, quick, and good prices.
So far so good...

I've gone here a few times and they've always been friendly and done a very good job on regular stuff.
It's in alterations or special items (like comforters) that they're really lacking.
Everything has to be sent out and the time frame can vary anywhere from a couple of days to as much as a week.
If they did everything in-house, I'd use them a hellovalot more.

With a few other options available to me in this area, I'll always go back to Newport Cleaners!
Not sure how the owner (Khristy) does it, she manages to remember your last name and greets you as you walk in with your last name every single time.
Her longtime employees are as equally as good with greeting you with your name if you're a regular.
Recently there has been some turnover and the newer employees do not know your name but are still courteous.
Customer Services goes a long way and if you feel the same you should go to this cleaner!
