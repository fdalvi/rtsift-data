This place is pretty tough to find, there really aren't any signs at all.
What they do have is world class cocktails, an amazing selection of scotch, and a wine list as good as any I've seen.
Gets pretty crazy over at Kitchen Bar, but you always leave satisfied!

This place is amazing-- so perfect and tucked away!
The cuisine is always different, versatile, and delicious.
They always have a cocktail menu  paired with the menu for the evening but the guy who works there can make you just about anything you want.
I attended the Scotch & S'mores event and nearly lost my mind-- peanut butter, homemade marshmallows, and a healthy pour of Jura Superstition.
Kudos to everyone at KITCHENbar: 81st and Elm!

Is PBR more your speed?
Well they've got that too!

Nothing but a bunch of 70pt Scotches here...ice is shoddy as well but it gets the job done.
Been here a handful of times, not sure they follow no burn days.
But the bourbon staved smoked marshmallows are to die for.
You can also enjoy a nice selection of Guatemalan beers and Mexican IPAs from the Sonoran region.

Sometimes you find a place that redefines what you think is possible in a restaurant!!
Amazing food combined with amazing staff.
Come on the slightly slower midweek for the best service, but the cocktails are always on point.
and the bartenders are amazing!!
Never had a bad bite, and the oysters are the best in Phoenix!

Does this place really exist?
Foursquare doesn't have it.
Google doesn't have it.
I will totally change my review (or delete it) if someone can chime in and confirm this place...
