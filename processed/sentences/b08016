These guys are great!
They were professional, safe and funny too.
They even offered to help get the piano setup in the house.
We highly recommend them for piano moving!

I chose these guys to pick up and deliver a piano, which I got a great deal on at a yard sale back in May.
They were able to work with my schedule and fit me in within a couple of days.
Dave was amazing at his expertise on placing the piano on moving wheels, maneuvering, and loading  it.
He took great care and had a professional trailer to load and secure the piano for the drive.
Good communication and expected time frame estitmate.
Their prices were very competitive and I believe they have flat rates based on type of piano in the Phoenix metro area, which is nice to know the cost upfront.

These guys moved my baby grand piano last week.
They were incredible.
They had a custom made piano dolly that made it look easy.
They disassembled and reassembled the piano in no time.
They were great.
