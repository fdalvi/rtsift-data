Whenever I need my checks cashed or to make a deposit I always come to this location.
It's down the street and I always get awesome service.
Everybody is always nice, and it really doesn't take long at all -- some locations I can't say the same about.
The extra bonus: I usually come with my dogs in the back of my car and when I go through the drive-thru they send a biscuit with my receipt.
My dogs love this place as much as I do now.

I bank with the main giants.
Wells Fargo is one of those giant banks.
I am going to review the service of the location.
So if you want a review on the evils of big bank America, you won't find it here.
I needed to get some documents notorized.
I remember hearing that Wells Fargo did this for free if you have a certain account.
I walked into the branch and let them know what kind of checking account I had and they let me know that they notorize for free for all account holders.
I sat and waited for the the associate to come get me.
I only waited for a few minutes.
I sat next to a kid who looked like he was getting ready to be interviewed.
I was then greeted by the Well Fargo associate and went to his office space.
His name was Paulo and he was a financial advisor for Wells Fargo.
He was very friendly.
I was happy that I didn't run into anyone that looked like they hated their job at this branch.
We had a long conversation which was great.
I have two small children so an adult conversation is always a breathe of fresh air.
Overall if I needed to do some banking at Wells Fargo I will most likely be at this branch.
If you are in the area check them out.
Cheers!

Great people that work in the bank but as a whole, Wells Fargo is just as bad as the other large banks, responsible for the housing crisis in the US.
GO LOCAL!!
