Not your ganny's yarn store.
A place for those who knit and crochet or want to learn.
They have this wool called Loppy Mango out of New York that is TO DIE for.
I had not knitted for 5 years and I fell right back in love after a quick lesson from Brenda, the owner.
Come here to ignite your creativity and bring a friend!

Unwind Knitting is amazing!
Brenda, the owner, was very friendly and passionate about her new shop.
I'm from out of town - but I can't wait to return the next time I'm in Vegas.
She had a great selection of yarns, lots of samples (which helped sell me on two new-to-me yarns) and has a great "vibe" going.
It's an excellent shop for new or experienced knitters.
You should definitely check it out!

Cool place on the 'other' end of the strip.
My pregnant wife was jonesing for some knitting yarn, and this place fit the bill!
The girl working was very friendinly, and it seemed like a hip, convienient place to get the goods.
