I had a very large guitar case (Jackson Flying V) in which the handle had broken off.
I had estimates from other places for 50 bucks and even more to put a new one on.
REALLY???
This joint hooked me up for 25, and I also had a nice pair of Cole Hahn sandals fixed for same price... 50 bucks, great work, done in a timely manner, friendly & courteous service.
What else could you ask for?

I had taken my boots in to have repaired.
They are Nine West Boots, worn one season.
They had light distress to toe & heels.
They also need the heal caps replaced.When I went back in to pick up the boots, Im pretty sure they never touched them untill I walked in.
i waited 15 minutes.
The boots were "spray painted" not repaired.
stilll wet and he said they had to "air dry"..
Really???
shouldn't that already be done?!
Also, the price I paid was $10 more then I was quoted.
I would definitely not recommmend this company, nor will I use them again.

Will never return.
Ridiculous prices and crappy work.
Had boots resoled and tips put on another pair of heels.
As they handed me the shoes, the tip fell off in his hand!!
So he puts it back on, I wear them the next day and the tip is missing after one hour of wear.
Not sure about the boots, too scared to wear them incase the whole sole falls off!!!
You suck Moses!
Would try to fix shoes myself before ever returning to your shop!!
I don't trust them to even attempt to fix them, will go elsewhere and pay again!
By the way, the price of this shoddy work??
$65!
Beware!
Go anywhere else!

I bring them several shoes to have re-stitched and/or leather straps shortened.
Always happy with the quality of the work and the timely matter in which its completed.
Would HIGHLY recommend for any leather shoe repairs or rubber sole augmentations.

I took a couple pair of shoes there because somebody recommended them to me.
I think they did an ok job.
I did have to take one pair back for some follow up work.
