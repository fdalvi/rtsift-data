I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream!
Thankfully real ice cream has arrived in Queen Creek.
We have had the yogurt jungle, but c'mon, that's like hankerin' for a big Thanksgiving turkey and having to settle for tofurkey.
The store provides a wide selection - the traditional scooped ice cream, in addition to soft serve and the 31 Below shake.
Very kid friendly with child size items, novelties like the baseball helmet sundae and the occassional free cone day.
In honor of the upcoming football season, the flavor for September is Quarterback Crunch.
I went with the oreo sundae and it was excellent ($4.99).
Fairly standard operation as far as chains go, but I expect the store to do well in the limited selection Queen Creek area.

Yay for ice cream!
I love the selection of flavors plus the soft serve, shakes, sundaes and everything else they have.
Cute ice cream cakes too.
This is one of our favorite place to "go for ice cream".

Ice cream scoopers are kinda rude sometimes, but awesome ice cream.
This is the franchise I would always go to as a kid so I love it for that, but my main reason for leaving this review is to get the owner to smack the crew into gear and stop being rude.

You can't beat the after school $1 kids cones Mon - Thu, the always happy service and classically good, not overpriced ice cream

Always friendly and helpful.
The portions are enormous as well.
