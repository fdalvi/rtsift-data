My son has been to almost every Kids Quest in Las Vegas but one.
What he told me about this place was that it was small and not as fun as the other KQ.
I'm thinking because not many kids were there and plus like he said, there wasn't much to do.
I'm sure the staff here is friendly, which is why I have a hard time believing this place should be a 1 star, but sorry to say if my son didn't like it much no reason for me to come back or even rate this place any better than what I did at other Kids Quests.
So based on his view, I had to rate this lower compared to what I reviewed on other Kids Quest.

Our boys go here all the time.
They love it and everyone is super nice.
It's a great place if you just need a couple hours without the kids to eat or gamble a little.

Parents get to play..kids get to play.
Win win for everyone.
