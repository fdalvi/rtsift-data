Beautiful course and the clubhouse is very elegant!
I love their pro shop because they offer 40% discount on their clothing for members our guest of members!
a their Loud Mouth collection is awesome, but I wish they had more skorts!
Oh yeah, just remember, all of the putts break toward the valley!

The Executive Chef is quite handsome!

Went to a bridal shower here today.
Food & service was wonderful.
We had a salad bar with choice of chicken or salmon to top it off.
Beautiful views, great decor & comfortable atmosphere.
