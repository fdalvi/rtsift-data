The "Ideal" dive bar... although the front room, with its grizzled clientele, was a bit sketchy, we found the back porch to be the perfect size for our large-ish group to lay claim to.

If you are into being hip, head to Mickey's.
This is a bar for men and women who work for a living (not that type of work social workers and academics do, but they are just as welcome).
The bartenders are great (and often includes an owner).
The beer taps have a nice selection, the price is lower than the more trendy bars of the area.
It is an old school Wisconsin bar with a lot of charm, but little pretension.

The drink glasses are huge and they actually make a good drink.
The juke box is awesome.
One pool table with some video poker.
Some of the best sweet and salty bar snacks in the neighborhood.
They also have a free Thanksgiving and Christmas feast.
It is the only bar in the neighborhood that will stay open until two as long as there is one person there...
