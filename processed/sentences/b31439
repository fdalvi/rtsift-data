I work in this upscale outdoor strip Mall called "la Mirada" and was so glad to see they were opening a new Papa Johns Pizza takeout and delivery here.
Since the opening, we have ordered from here a few times and the pizza has been delicious.
Unlike Domino's (across the street) and Pizza Hut, Papa Johns tries to add larger sized and "superior-quality ingredients" in their pizza.
They do a nice job.
We at the the office tend to agree!

Its so great to have a Papa Johns in the neighborhood, its been a long time coming!
Thanks.

We were using a more local business for pizza and wanted to try Papa John's as they were new to our area.
I must say that Papa John's has the very best pizza we have ever had AND they deliver.
The crust is always tender even the next day after re-heating in the microwave.
They have a very extensive list of toppings and the flavor can't be beat.
The prices are more than fair.
I would recommend Papa John's to anyone that likes pizza (and who doesn't).
If you have never tried them, give them a chance and you won't be disappointed.

I am bummed, this was my favorite Papa Johns.
We used to order pizzas at least once a week.
We had a little tradition with my hubby, Monday or Tuesday night we would order a pizza and open a bottle of wine and watch one of our shows recorded in our DVR.
We went last Saturday and the store was closed.
We called HQ and the rep said they didn't see the location in the website.
This store closed suddenly, boo.

They are only 7 miles straight shot down Pima and they don't deliver to my house.
Stupid.

There's a reason they closed.
Not very good
