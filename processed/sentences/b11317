I am a super beginner at playing guitar and quit after a month.. after letting it sit in my garage for a year, i finally decided to get it fixed.
Jim was wonderful!
He gave me (I wish I knew what it's called) that costs $3 extra for free!!
Steve, Jim's best friend, had so many interesting stories to tell while I waited for my guitar to be fixed.
It's nice to see people who're so passionate about music and genuinely care about your ability to learn more.

Amazing work, time after time, I have taken my instruments to Advanced Guitar and the staff and owner have always been great.
I have over 32 guitars and after going thru most everyone in las vegas reputable, I landed on jims door step pleading for help with a few real problem child guitars, Impossible fixes made possible by Jim and Billy (RIP he now works for Circe Du Soile...lol) 90% of the time jim nails it on the first fun sometimes things still need a little more tweaking but He always supports his work and always comes thru with flying colors.
Thanks Jim and Advanced Guitar for Keeping my instruments on Stage and performing like a pro.

I brought them a nice Tacoma flat-top with a broken headstock just above the nut.
I wasn't expecting much due to the extent of the damage.
The finished repair far exceeded my expectations.
I don't think anyone would even know it had been repaired by looking at the guitar.
They also worked on the action and leveled the frets.
The guitar now plays like a $10,000 McPherson.
They even repaired a small crack in the top, and a few other things for free.
I couldn't be more pleased with the service and quality of their work.
And  all for a reasonable price.
