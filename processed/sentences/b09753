This place is a hidden GEM and an easy FIVE stars!
Stopped in at a number of bicycle shops with my son all around the area.
This place gave us the time of day, helped and was a true pleasure to deal with.
We ended up getting a great bike for my son and the owner tuned it up before letting us leave.
Really great service that they take pride in their shop.
Going back next week for car work!

I can't believe what horrible service I received.
I don't know if he was the owner, but a guy name Fred assisted me and my wife and we both could smell alcohol on his breath.
I asked a few questions and he seemed somewhat confused.
We left fairly quickly.
Would not recommend coming here.

Since using Coury's Auto for the first time, I have yet to use another auto repair shop.
I have recommended them to several of my girlfriends (because a trustworthy shop is hard to find).
They have all thanked me for pointing them in the right direction!
I wish I was closer, but I'll still make the drive.
It's worth it for peace of mind!
