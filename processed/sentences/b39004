Fast and friendly staff!
Conveniently located in the food court of the Monte Carlo Hotel just feet from the elevator.

Not sure if the review for this place is the casino itself or the Starbucks inside the casino.
I did go to both so I can do a brief review on each one for the sake of this place.
Casino: Plenty of roulette tables and electronic machines to play the game on, a good amount of poker tables, craps and more than enough slot machines.
You will have no trouble finding something to test your luck in and hope to walk out a winner.
Don't forget to wash your hands and/or sanitize them after playing.
Lots of people touch these things.
I did not find a non-smoking section in the casino so it might be fairly small or not marked.
I did see a few restrooms but again, not so easy to find.
Starbucks inside the Monte Carlo casino: It was pretty busy in the middle of the afternoon when the husband and I showed up.
There was one cashier and one barista multi tasking.
They must have had their hands full since when we arrived I over heard the cashier tell the barista that he forgot to brew a fresh pot of coffee so he excused himself and made one for the customers that had been patiently waiting.
Even with the place being busy, we didn't wait too long for our drink and our cookie.

It's just alright.
No bells or whistles.
I haven't stayed here in years, and since then they've remodeled.
But the pub doesn't brew their own beer anymore!
Boo!
Nice that it still has a tram that connects you to Aria, Crystals and Bellagio.
Convenient, but wish it covered the whole end of this side of the strip.
Summer at the check in desk was great- got us a view and printed my gaming cards for us.

The casino is glclean and very classy looking.
They have a wide variety of slots.
The slot technicians are really slow to arrive if you need help.
Most other staff were friendly.
