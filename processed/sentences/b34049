It's a fast food resturaunt.
The fact that the order taking process is confusing is not the fault of the store, but of the corporation.
Maybe they could fix that???
Otherwise, they did a good job, got our order right, served in a good time.

Dropped by at 12:01 AM.
Received product at 12:10 AM.
Burger was barely warm and very dry.
So much for "hot-and-juicy".
The person at the window asked me if I wanted a receipt.
I bet they were hoping I would say no.
The evidence of when I placed the order was there.
Doesn't everyone get a receipt without asking?
What a joke.
This franchise should be closed ASAP.
I contacted Wendy's corporate.
They are gonna take your store away soon :)

Very friendly while taking my order at the drive through.
Food is always hot.
Good store.
