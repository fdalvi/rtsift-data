Moroccan themed furniture?
What's that, I hear you ask?
Well, it's just sort of fancy wood stuff.
It's really, really nice though.
The first thing you see when you walk in is an incredibly cool circular book/cd case.
It's hard to describe, but it has shelves going off in all direction and is just, well, fantastic.
It is Â£650 though.
Mamaison also sell various other trinkets and what not.
There's a solitary djembe in there (not sure how a West African drum made it's way into a North African furniture shop, but I'm not complaining), and the most fantastic chess boards.
They really caught my eye - absolutely stunning.
It is a little tacky - the walls are adorned with 'I love Morocco' t-shirts, and it's extremely busy with stock, making it difficult to manoeuvre around the place, but it's worth a look if you want a more interesting item to decorate your house.
They also kindly provide the translation of 'Mamaison' next to the sign.
