I went one Friday night right after work and met my wife for a (meaning "one") drink.
It was happy hour and the free hotdogs were there for the eatin'-yum!
WELL, we ordered two bacardi and gingers and the bar tender gave us the drinks and said $4.50 please.
I said, we ordered TWO-why so cheap is it happy hour?
She said, nope-"we are always happy here" but that was their REGULAR price.
$2.25 for a call drink AND free hotdogs (when i was there) --my kind of place!!
We ended up staying for a few hours!!
It is attached to the Decatur Drug store which has one of the last drugstore diners in Vegas!
I heard the bar is under a new owner, but it doesn't sound like it changed any!
www.decaturliquor.com note- you can buy booze to go also!

Ahhh, the Decatur!
Went there on Thanksgiving day with my boy Dahmer and was plenty surprised by the hospitality.
They actually had a complete turkey dinner spread out on the pool table, available for free for everyone.
Home made by the local clientele and delicious!
Huge beer mugs and a decent tap selection, as well plenty of local characters.
Highly recommend this classic dive.

Super cool bartenders.
Dangerously cheap drinks.
What more is there to say?

Super strong drinks for super cheap.
They have great specials, and it seems they always have a holiday celebration of some sort.
The bar is incredibly large too.
Wasn't too smokey when I was there, but it was mid afternoon.
When I'm, in the area this would be a place to stop again for sure!
