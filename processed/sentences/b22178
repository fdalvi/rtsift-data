I have lived in Arizona for over 10 years and I found it to be the hardest ever to find a great hair stylist.
Well my search is over, I have been seeing Jessie @ Salone Bellissima for a little over a year now and I absolutely love her.
She is a top notch hair stylist, every time I get my hair done I love it.
She is a perfectionist when it comes to hair, and thats what you want most in a stylist.
She is a genius when it comes to coloring , she didn't bat an eye when I wanted to go from blonde to burnette and now I am back to blonde.
I would consider myself to be pretty picky when it comes to coloring my hair and she does amazing everytime.
And the best part is; it's like being in the movie Steel Magnolia's.
It's just 3 person studio, but it's decorated so cute and Jessie is always waiting to give you a hug as you enter the salon.
I love getting my hair done by jessie and I will never change from her.
I'd even fly in to see her if I ever moved out of AZ, thats how good she is.
She recentely moved to a new location next to the Safeway on Happy Valley Road.
Please call her in advance to get the correct address.

Jessie at Salone Bellissima is one of a kind.
Not only does she do phenomenal work with color and style, she is an absolute sweetheart.
I have finally found a colorist that exceeds my expectations with quality work, great prices (not found anywhere else!
) and a warm and  friendly personality.

Really and truly, she is amazing.
I live and work in New York City, but come home to Arizona to visit my family in the summer and over the holidays.
I have tried to find someone in NYC that can come close to the quality cut and color I receive from Jessie, but am convinced it does not exist!
So, now I get my hair colored and cut by Jessie sometimes as little as 2-3 times a year, but she does such an amazing job, it grows out beautifully!!
Even a short wedge cut was done so well, It lasted forever and looked great even as it grew out!
I am constantly asked by my friends in the city, 'who does your hair?
'  Salone Bellissima, too bad Jessie can't open a place in NYC!
Also, from a short wedge cut, to long shoulder length hair, to saving my head from a horrifying cut done by someone else, I have always been thrilled with her haircuts!
I have sometimes curly, sometimes straight hair and she always knows how to cut it so it can work either way.
Finally, Jessie is so lovely, spending an hour with her is always a pleasure.
She will treat you like family and cut and color like the incredible professional she is.

Jessie is amazing!!!!!
I came to her with a true challenge and she was able to create a great new look without damaging my hair!
I wanted highlights for the summer and she came up with a way to lighten my hair without harsh chemicals like bleach.
Jessie has many years of experience and she only uses the best products!
I am soooooooo happy to have found such an amazing stylist!!!!

The owner said she was too busy and pushed me off to her partner in the 2 chair salon.
Well, when I tried to get this gal back on the phone before Xmas--and left messages twice--I never even got a call back.
She did a mediocre job, charged way too much for her service of a cut and lowlights and now won't answer the phone?
But I hadn't been here long and didn't know where else to go...however, I found someone.
No thanks, Salone Bellissima, you were not much help at all here.

I tried calling and asking how much they charge but they hung up on me!
Definitely won't even try this place.
