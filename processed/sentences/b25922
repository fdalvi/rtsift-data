I must say that for awhile now I have stayed clear of Subways because of the smell inside the restaurants making you smell just like it when you leave but ....
I am completely impressed at how clean and non smelly this store was compared to the ones I've visited at in Alaska.
The employees are freindlier and they didn't pile my pickles in one spot or squirt a huge blob of mayo in a particular spot!
I'm not quite sure the names of the 2 guys working tonight but THANKS!
I am now a fan of Subway again :-D

I felt compelled to write a review for this particular Subway location.
The food is the same as expected but the employees are the exception.
I always forget to write down the names of the gentlemen that work there but they are the reason I go back again and again.
My daughter loves Subway already but these guys will make whatever crazy sandwich she wants that day where other locations will only create to the already set sandwich menu.
They smile and laugh each time but are always willing to make it to order for her.
If you like Subway and think outside the sandwich box, I am sure these gentleman can keep up.
Well done.

The 3 employees were so busy talking to each other they couldn't remember what we ordered, kept having to ask, and still didn't get it right.
In the midst of the three employees continuing in their personal chaos, my husband finally said, "ok, time out!
I'm the customer.
Make our sandwiches and then take care of your issues.".
They stopped for a split second, all three looked at us, then they actually IGNORED us, finished their conversation, then finished our sandwiches.
We were the only ones in there and we really were shocked!
Good thing I like avacado, because it ended up on my sandwich & I didn't order it, and after telling the girl, she said, "I thought you said...".
Still had the order wrong!
Whew!
