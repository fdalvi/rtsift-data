Great wee bar which has ice cold beers and decent grub which is worth the price , staff are very friendly and they serve you quickly as well , all in all a good little pub with great atmosphere.

Another place I've been coming to for a large number of years and I currently seem to be in a cycle of going a lot more than usual (every night this weekend for example).
They have a great range of well priced ales, knowledgeable and pleasant staff, an interesting original interior and, having finally eaten there last night, a good solid range of well priced food - I opted for salmon fishcakes which were just the right side of crispy outside and amply moist within whilst the thick chips were as good as I've had anywhere.
A classic "local" if ever there was one.
Ate here again at the weekend - haggis, neeps and tatties was well priced and well proportioned.

My boyfriend and I stumbled across this place during the winter and have since been back quite a few times.
It is a lovely traditional pub tucked away on one of the streets in the New Town.
It has a cosy wee snug that's only really got room for two or three people, so you can snuggle up to your love with a pint in private.
The bar has a fantastic range of single malts and a good selection of real ales, the helpful barman will helpfully talk you through things if you're having trouble making up your mind.
There's also a beer garden, so if the weather's nice you can enjoy a fag and a drink at the same time (what luxury!).
This place feels like a little haven in the new town.

One of the best pubs in Edinburgh.
PRICE: Reasonable for what it sells, expensive in comparison to other pubs.
SIZE: Plenty of alcoves and rooms, giving the place a big feel, but it is in fact not that big.
FEEL: The pub is decorated in a tasteful, traditional manner, and is lit warmly.
RANGE: The pub stocks a regularly replenished supply of real ale, and they also have a wide selection of top class whiskies and spirits.
They often have some surprising delights on tap, such as Aspall cider.
TOILETS: Drop down some stairs and find the excellent toilets, well fitted and clean.
I first started coming here a couple of years ago with the Grampian Speleological Group (a caving club), where they have their regular meets.
We as a large group are well catered-for, and a large space is set aside for us.
The staff are friendly, helpful, and always have a drink-related bit of advice to give if you are stumped for ideas as to which of the many real ales and ciders to buy.
Prices are not cheap, but equally are not unreasonable for the quality of ales they offer.
I love the design of the place too.
It has a higgledy-piggledy arrangement of alcoves and rooms that give the place a really interesting feel.
Not their choice in particular, simply what happens when you set a pub under an old New Town building.
The pub is quite a way away from the city centre or indeed the student south, which has its advantages and disadvantages.
It means that it is empty of Forest Caf√© crumpets and rowdy rowers, but it also means that it requires a long trek to get to.
Well worth it though.
I would give this fine establishment two thumbs-up and a shiny gold sticker.

Just off the beaten track in New Town, you will find this gem of a pub.
Inside is pretty large, stretching back quite a way and divided into little segments, offering a bit more privacy.
The bar has a ridonkulous amounts of beers and spirits, including some great single malts.
There are all the regular beers you'd want, including a healthy supply of Crabbie's, which has become my beer of the summer.
To add to that they have rotating guest ales, adding a bit of variety.
The last time I went they had Timothy Taylor's, always a favourite, and some Mexican beer with a gun wielding Speedy Gonzales-esque mouse as the logo.
To be honest that sold it to me, but as an added advantage it was really good, like a limier Corona.
If on the other hand, you're not an idiot and the image of a little Bandito mouse doesn't cause you to immediately buy whatever he's flogging, the barman is exceptionally helpful.
With a sound knowledge of all the beers on tap he can instruct you which ones are for you, occasionally proffering a free taster if you're lucky.
The real jewel in the crown of The Cumberland though is the garden.
Shielded by a weeping willow, it completely cuts out all sounds from the street and is a nice peaceful area for a few summer drinks.

I have no idea how many times I walked by the Cumberland thinking "man that place looks cool, I really need to go there some time" before promptly forgetting where it was located and what it was called.
Fortunately for me, I have a friend who is very well versed in bars with great ambiance and great beer, so when he took us on a pub crawl one night, we ended up here.
The Cumberland lived up to every expectation I had.
It is much bigger inside than you expect, without feeling too big, if that makes sense.
As others have said, it is divided into several different rooms so you have a bit more privacy but there is still plenty of space to accomodate the large numbers of people who flock here on the weekends.
It has a wonderful variety of beers which the bartenders are more than happy to sample out so you are sure to get a pint you will enjoy.
It also has a fantastic beer garden which inevitably ends up packed at the first hint of sunlight, regardless of the temperature.
I actually walked by on my way home today and felt a bit sad that my stoatin' hangover prevented a visit.
There is always next weekend ...

A very good pub, especially on a fine day to make the most of their great beer garden & a wide array of on-tap ale/beer.

The Cumberland Bar, made famous in Alexander McCall Smith's, The World According to Bertie is one of the many New Town bars dedicated to serving really good beers in a relaxed atmosphere.
In the past I have been a regular at the Monday night pub quizzes which are always well supported, helped by the free entry and the prize of a bottle of wine or a t-shirt for the team that finishes next to last.
The bar has a good array of beers, including my own personal favourite, Black Isle Blond.
However, there are always a steady flow of guest beers from small breweries which makes going back to the Cumberland a pleasure to try something new.
There is a selection of pub food available which is OK in quality, nothing to shout home about but nothing you would complain about either.

One of my favourites - Fergus loves a visit here too.
It's a great local, on our park route - and we get to walk home along the cycle path, through the old railway tunnel, which is always fab.
Great range of beers, with Black Isle always on tap (Blonde - stay away from lagers and try this beauty!
) and a good range of wee cubby holes to sit in, the big room at the back if you want a more typical pub vibe, or the garden if the sun's shining.
For a real treat, I get a bowl of chips (classic chips, not curly fries) and douse them in vinegar (there's proper bottles of Sarson's - a good detail) to enjoy with my pint - and if Fergus is lucky, he gets a couple too.
The staff are regular (isn't it lovely, to see familiar faces?
) and really friendly - they love Fergus and always welcome him with a wee biscuit, the lucky boy.
There's always a great selection of people - and dogs - in the Cumberland; it's a real slice of New Town life.

I really enjoyed coming to here during my 3 day visit.
Great neighborhood type of pub filled with friendly locals which I didn't have any trouble starting up conversations with.
There is a "huge" selection of beers here with perhaps my favorite being Black Isle.
The food was also really good here too!
If you happen to be staying at the Walton, this is a great place as it's just one short block away.
A great place to finish off the day after walking about Edinburgh.
