We had a great experience with Bee Clean Pools LLC.
Casey was very professional and helped me save money by showing me how to do some things on my own.
When it was time to drain and refill the pool Casey even helped me by diggging around in my rocks to find the sewer clean out.
Good honest service at a great price!
My wife and my wallet couldn't be happier.
Thanks!

I contacted Casey about cleaning the pool in my newly purchased house.
I'm a first time home owner and pool owner.
Casey's prices were slightly higher than some other companies I found, but after speaking with Casey, I knew is was the company to go with.
He is friendly, responsive, EXTREMELY through and very knowledgeable.
It's evident that he really does care about his business and that your pool is in top shape.
Being new to pools and homes, he even assisted in getting our fountain up and running.
Once we're settled, we'll most certainly  be taking Casey's "Pool School" so we can start taking care of the maintenance ourselves!
