I've been here twice and this is also my mother's podiatrist.
I came in here two years ago to have my old botched ingrown toenail removed (my old podiatrist took out BOTH sides, very painful, it never grew correctly on the bottom) and both doctors made sure it was less painful for me.
I bumped my big toe the other day and it bumped the nail the wrong way, I cut my nail and it felt awful.
I needed an appointment immediately and they scheduled me for the same day (Rebecca is a sweetheart!
-  their receptionist).
I needed to have the nail cut on one side and I was in and out of there quickly with good advice on how to help my foot heal as quickly as possible.
Dr.  Abraham is the sweetest and I was out of there super quick.
Love the service and friendly environment

This is a doctor who really cares and tells the truth.
He does not try to sell you anything; he simply gives you the alternatives and if you ask his opinion, recommends conservative treatment.
He also has an efficient, friendly staff  You can't ask for more than that.

Once Dr. Harlan makes a surgical error, rather than trying to help rectify the situation, he keeps stalling and saying that you are still healing until your 90 day post-op is up.
Then he pushes you out, in worse shape than when you first saw him!
Dr. Harlan has no compassion, all he wants is $$$$, he really does not care about his patients.
And, by the way, he must not be human because according to him, HE DOES NOT MAKE MISTAKES!
You would be smart to go somewhere else.
