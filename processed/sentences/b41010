This Donut Shop just opened at Bonanza and Nellis and they are great!
They are located in the same shop that the old "Friendly Donut Shop" was and I have to say their donuts are nearly, if not as good as, Friendly's.
We have lamented not having a good donut shop nearby on Sunrise Mountain and Anthony's fits the bill.
Donuts are fresh and not too sweet or doughy like many other places.
They have raised, cake and old fashioned style and discounts for large orders.

This is a spotless and super friendly Mom & Pop joint so I want to be a positive as I can.
The Donuts are very good.
They make their own fresh pastry cream so if you like those kind of donuts you are in luck.
But the coffee was weak And burned from being on the hot plate too long.
The "chocolate" frosting has so little cocoa in it it's a pale brown and gritty from sugar.
In the case the bagels seemed lost in translation and the croissant criminally undercooked.
Still the donuts are fresh as fresh can be and very tasty.
The Apple fritters looked amazing.
4 donuts for $2.99 was a good deal.
Maybe when you go the coffee will be fresher.

Super clean shop.
The person running the shop came out and washed his hands before helping us, which makes me happy.
The doughnuts taste great and the price is good- $7.99 for a dozen.
We will be back.

Hands down, the best donuts I have had in Las Vegas.
Made fresh daily on property.
Not too sweet like Krispy Kreme nor too dry like dunkin donuts.
Perfect.
Service is always above average.
Anthony the owner is a very kind man who remembers faces.
Go here.
Now.
