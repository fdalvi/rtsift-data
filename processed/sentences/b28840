My husband and I needed to get FBI fingerprint sets for international work visas, and the guys at the Pack Ship and Print Center did a wonderful job.
We've gone through this process annually for nearly a decade, and I've never had someone be so thorough.
They gave us pointers to make sure our prints would turn out well (tip: don't look at the fingerprint card), and then carefully reviewed them to make sure.
Would highly recommend.

I took a package with a preprinted label on it to return to amazon.
They took the package, and  lost it.
They refused to take responsibility for it even after I gave them the package number and asked me repeatedly if maybe I just thought I took it there.
I live right down the road so went here out of convenience but never will again!

I have used Pack Ship and Print Center for years.
They have always had fast service.
The owners are personal and make sure everything is taken care of.
The price is normally cheaper with them because I don't have a UPS account.
