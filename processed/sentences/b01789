Very nice experience!
Unlike all of the big "chain" rental companies which take an hour to get your car, I was in & out of this place in literally under 10 minutes.
I got a 2008 Kia Sedona mini van for a very good price for the week (about 20% less than any of large chains), and it included 1,400 miles which should be plenty.
The staff was very courteous and friendly, and they even let me park the car in the lot next door because I wasn't going to be able to actually pick it up with another person until after they were closed.
Another thing I like about them is that you aren't limited to just one driver, and any additional drivers don't need to be present at the time of rentaly like a lot of other places require.
You can add anyone else as a driver at a later date by simply snapping a pic of their drivers license and emailing to them.
Very convenient!
I will update this review when I return the car if I have any problems.
P.S.
STAY AWAY FROM PHOENIX CAR RENTALS a.k.a.
SABAN'S RENT-A-CAR!!
I WAS INITIALLY GOING TO RENT FROM THEM BECAUSE THEIR PRICES WERE SO LOW, BUT AFTER PULLING IN THE PARKING LOT AND SEEING ALL OF THE BEAT UP OLD CARS AND THEN READING SOME YELP REVIEWS ON MY PHONE I DECIDED TO LOOK ELSEWHERE - AND I'M GLAD I DID BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN I FOUND A1 VAN LEASING JUST DOWN THE ROAD!

Their van was was super clean, and drove great!!!
They also helped us out in a pinch when we needed a van last minute.
Awesome awesome, thank you!

The people, vehicles, equipment, and prices are all reasons to not look any further!

I used this company for the first time.
Never rented a 12 passenger van before.
GMC van was great.
They gave me 1800 miles for the week and I used 1500.
Returned it after a week and they were somebody I would recommend to anyone wanting to rent a van.
