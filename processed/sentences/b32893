I can't say anything about living here because I will NEVER move in here.
I was looking for an apartment and the sales lady was extremely rude.
Also, beware that the prices they email you and the prices the sales person will give you will be different!

Have been living here for over a year and love it.
Very friendly maintenance people.
Very modern interiors, including one of the nicest kitchens I have seen in a Vegas apartment.
I live in one of the stand alone lofts and all of my friends are always impressed by the unique layout of the loft and by the fact that I have an entire building to myself.
I would strongly recommend living here!

Good location to get around the Las Vegas valley.
The apartments are spacious, but the appliances are not the best quality.
For there Amenities they only have a gym and a pool, both are just ok compared to other properties.
People do not pick up there dogs poop, and it seams like trash is always on the property.
All in all the property is ok, for the price you pay I would expect more !

I only give it this because I never seen an apartment I waited for 50 minutes after the leasing agent said 10-15 minutes.
She never had the decency to come out and tell  me it will be a few more minutes..
It looked nice but there are many nice apartments.
Sorry The Venue we will never do business..
