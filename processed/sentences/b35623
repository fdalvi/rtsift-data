My friend emailed Josh to set up a showing for a rental.
Josh never showed.
When my friend called him he answered his phone with the radio blasting in the back ground and said sorry man I totally forgot.
Then he called the tenant and said someone was out front could you let them in.
Zero notice.
Josh said he wasn't coming over to show it.
The tenant came out and said Josh harasses her every month and even let the house go into foreclosure without notice.
My friend never pursued it because of the poor management.

I have only been renting from them for a few months now and it has been nothing but a headache.
Many things were still broken when we moved in and it takes weeks to months for things to get fixed.
Our manager did not even meet us at the house when we got the keys, she gave us the lock box code and said she would be out the next day to get the lock box.
It is still on our door two months later.
If you can rent from another company, DO!

Valley Executives has been working across the Phoenix Valley for 8 successful years.
Property Management is a problem solving business by nature....It is very difficult to stay on top of repairs, showings, vendor and client feedback without knowing the situation.
VEPM has a stellar record of getting things done and providing the best service possible.
We are always striving to improve and appreciate all feedback.
So here's hoping that Mr. Todd was able to find something to suit his needs.
Maybe even without the help of a "friend" or using the opinions of others without knowing the facts.
