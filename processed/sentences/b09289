As we all know, finding a good mechanic shop is few and far between.
Finding one that is honest, trustworthy, fair-priced, is even more difficult.
On a referral from a coworker, I decided to give these guys a shot.
They are a little bit out of the way for me, but WELL-worth it.
Auto repairs can vary greatly, and owning a Mercedes, I know too well that some shops well recommend and even complete services that are not at all necessary.
This family-run business has already saved me at least $500 in just two services from what I would have paid at the dealership and other local German car specialists.
I recently needed a new coolant tank.
I was quoted $260 from another local shop (not even the dealership).
Lucky star charged me $150 out the door, without even knowing the other quote.
These guys will tell you exactly what, and only what you NEED done, and give you pricing that seems to be barely above cost!
Highly recommended.

Bait and switch so much for free diagnostic.

They are very helpful and knowledgeable there at AZ Lucky Star.
The staff is very friendly.

Honest and reliable service
