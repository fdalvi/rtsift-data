Someone that understands business.
I just went in to get a new battery.
I didn't have any cash on me so he told me to come back whenever and pay him.
I don't often go to watch repair shops, but if I ever need to or someone asks I will certainly send my business to DeChance.
I will also be going back tomorrow to pay him.

I had a broken watch band and was looking for a nearby repair place.
Doug was great, he replaced the missing pin, tightened up the fit, all while I waited and for a whopping $5.
When the watch itself needs repairing, I would not hesitate to go back here.

Doug has been maintaining my two Rolex watches for over a decade.
He is honest, and technically superb.
A  pleasure to work with!

Took in two of my watches for new batteries and a band repair.
Extremely friendly and prompt service.
Very low prices.

Doug did a great job on my Tag.
It took longer then expected but was not his fault.
Fixed it and polished it like new.
I highly recomend him.

Always professional and reliable service for big or small jobs.
I highly recommend their services.
