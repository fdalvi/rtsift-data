I felt I had to write a review about this place to ward off potential curious passers by.
If you want to spend $900 (SALE PRICE!
) for a set of aluminum small tables (no kidding) I will invite you to peruse the selection here.
The stuff here is not that nice.
Some really old school items that cost about 4 to 5 times what you think they should/could cost.
I just can't justify the prices of their goods.
Also, when I came in to look around I received no service whatsoever.
You can get much prettier and much much more reasonable furniture at Cost Plus, Ikea, Overstock.com and Home Goods.

Boy oh Boy I wish I would have looked at the review before going in this afternoon.
What a waste of time.
My sister and I probably passed three sales people and not one greeted us.
Its not like they were busy, the place was empty, seriously other than my sister and I there was one older gentleman.
I guess we didn't look the part.
I was hoping to find some great furniture (gotta an entire house to fill) but no luck, just over priced pieces that look of poor quality.
For the prices they charge I would rather go to Thomasville or Ethan Allan, at least they offer better quality, more variety and they don't ignore customers.

Over the past several years we had spent thousands of dollars on numerous pieces of furniture for our home at Robb & Stucky.
Always pricy, the most recent item we looked to purchase from them really sent them to new heights.
A simple, small, no frills ottoman... for $829.00!!!
We balked.. sought prices from other firms (which R&S had indicated they would match)... but when the numbers came back as low as $389.00 for the same item... they refused to honor the commitment.
So with little other choice we went somewhere else... and suggest you do the same...(save allot of time and effort).
Note: If ya do want to shop at R&S  just better get there sometime soon... they're closing up shop in Vegas, another victim of the poor economy.
