Uniforms for officers.
Caters to PPD and MSCO Highway Patrol, and a few others I can't remember... but their customer service is amazing.
Wide selection of apparel and police accessories.
A little more on the pricy side, but if you've been to uniform places, the price is worth the added customer service :)

28 stars for this place!!!
They have EVERYTHING you will need (including beautiful smiles and excellent service)!!!

Bought some 511 gear for my husband.
The lady was very nice and even shipped to a APO box address for me.
I love seeing pink gear.
Got a free pen too lol love free stuff...
They have everything tactical from shoes, knives, protective gear, to clothes.
It's a little hidden but if you park by Wells Fargo or bank of America area you can find the place..
