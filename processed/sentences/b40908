I really like this location it is a bit small.
There are no crowds that I have ever ran into.
It is convenient for me off the 303 freeway and Glendale.
I can just drive and drop off mail.
If I have to go inside there are friendly faces there to help me.
I wish I added this location a long time ago.
I would have had more check ins.

Although this is an okay location, it is extremely inconvenient with the hours cut in the middle of the day for lunch and no large parcel drop box.
When you show up 10 minutes before they open and ask if you can drop off a package, they will scold you and treat you like a piece of crap so don't come here expecting anything better than minimal customer service.
Some of the postal workers that are here are just wonderful while others (a lady with blonde hair and glasses) is a wretched sea hag.
Because of the extremely poor attitude of this woman and not appreciating getting yelled at, I personally do not use this location anymore.

This post office is small, but very convenient to the people who live in the area.
The only issue I have is the customer service.
There are normally two different women who work the front lobby at different times.
We had a horrible encounter with the one who is blond and has glasses.
I never really have had to send any packages, so I had a couple questions.
This lady and her attitude while answering was disgusting.
She treated me like I was a complete idiot.
I gave her no reason to act like that.
If I have to mail a package, I always try to show up when the other lady is there.
She is always a pleasure to deal with.
