Big fan of the current  tart fro-yo craze, and this is the first instance of it I've found here in Madison - or Wisconsin for that matter.
That gets this place at least three stars right there...
The location is brand new, squirreled away on the second floor food court of the new University Square development, and it's the second franchise of an establishment from Ann Arbor.
They also serve Bubble Teas, which I haven't tried yet, but they seem pretty popular - especially among Asian students.
Flavors include plain/vanilla, and strawberry as of current.
Price is decent - but not inexpensive by any means - at just under $4 for a decent sized cup with 3 toppings.
The toppings range from cereals to fresh fruits and even lychee - an asian delicacy not so common in these parts.
The quality of the yogurt is good - not great - but it's pretty hard to mess this up.
The staff is also friendly enough, and they even gave me a punch card.
That's right, you eat 5 of the damn things and they give you one FREE!

I gave it 2-stars because all other bubble teas in Madison got 1-star.
If you want real bubble tea, make it yourself or go to China town.
They got some interesting chews for adding to the drinks - mango star (basically flavored agar) and coconut jelly strips.
The drinks are way too sweet and insufficient in real fruit for the price they charge.
I'd say, get just the plain tapioca milk tea.
Every flavor you request in addition will ruin it.

Tried their bubble Tea but was not impressed.
If you want Authentic bubble tea I'd say head over to Jade Mountain.
They know how to make Bubble Tea Taiwanese style.
