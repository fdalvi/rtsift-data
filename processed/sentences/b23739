I like this place... for what it is.
I've been to Four Kings once, and we only went because of it's proximity to the train, right across the street.
The first impression was very bad, as the bar smelled of something AWFUL like feet, onions, and stale alcohol.
They have plenty of coin-op pool tables which were all busy and apparently they are a big spot for neighborhood pool teams and clubs.
There were even a couple of guys giving a lesson to a gentleman.
They also have Golden Tee Live and a bowling game.
Beer here is CHEAP, like $7 per large pitcher which comes out to less than two dollars a beer.
I'll drink in a crappy dive like this for beer that cheap.
Overall, we didn't feel like it was a great bar we want to go back to, but it was a good not too busy place to play golden tee or have cheap beer.

Me?
I like this hive of scum and villany.
Find a quiet corner, shoot the shizzle with the bartender or the weird mix of people this place seems to attract.
Or play some pool.
Or play the jukebox.
Or drink some Harp (they have HARP on TAP).
Possibilities are...well, they have an end, but it's fun getting there!
