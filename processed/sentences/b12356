I used to think L & L Hawaiian Barbeque made the best Chicken Katsu in town until I discovered this little gem.
Their seafood platter is pretty good too.
It's right at the corner of Durango and Warm Springs in the Vons shopping center.
(Speaking of the shopping center, I have to make a little side review.
This place has a Japanese, Italian, Hawaiian, Chinese, a Coldstone Creamery, and a Buffalo Wild Wings all in the same complex!
And you wonder why I never bother to cook?

Noted as "Hawai'i's Best Plate Lunch Special" on their business card, I could only vouch for their Pork Lau Lau plate.
My first time dining there in June, I ordered the Pork Lau Lau then and couldn't really give them a fair review.
My taste buds were shot and everything tasted bland.
This time around, healthy and taste buds in full working order, I went ahead and ordered my favorite, the Pork Lau Lau.
I also asked for two scoops of mac salad instead of two scoops of rice.
(Most Hawaiian restaurants will substitute without charging, so I usually prefer to do that.
)  The pork lau lau was definitely a lot better than the one I had at Aloha Specialties Restaurant in the California Hotel!
(http://www.yelp.com/biz/wpnLPAnkMEb1NpC3xiD_qg?hrid=XPspyfknURLxczv4O2ZUvg)  It wasn't dry and old like the other place and had a lot more flavor.
I did add a lot of soy sauce to my dish, which I tend to do all the time.
I could have used a bit more fat in mine too, but that's more of a personal preference.
When I was done cleaning off my plate of two scoops of mac salad, one scoop of rice, and the pork lau lau dish,  my boyfriend looked at me and asked if that was a mini order or a full plate.
"Uh, a full one...they didn't offer the mini for the pork lau lau..."  I guess it was his way of calling me a piggie!
Haha!
I also had their spam musubi and it was definitely better than Aloha's again!
It tasted like what a spam musubi should taste like!

i only started going here b/c its the nearest hawaiian place near me.
its located in a strip mall.
its just a fast food hawaiian joint also offering catering items, which i would like to take advantage of in the future.
i usually order the mix meat plate...usually chicken katsu and beef short ribs w/rice and macaroni salad.
the chicken katsu is crispy and the beef short ribs are tasty, but could use some more kick.
my lovely dining companion seemed to really enjoy the pork lau lau b/c she finished that thing pretty damn quick.
it must have been tasty, but i question that she had to put a lot of soy sauce on the meat.
the portions are allright.
i think you get more at LL, but i give i am so glad they are right down the road from me.
ill be there a lot....

Gotta love the phone-in service.
I usually get the chicken katsu, kalua pork and spam musubi and it's always been great.
The service is excellent...much better than that joke of a restaurant Aloha Kitchen near UNLV.

Ohana has kept me intrigued.
I have tasted the Chicken Katsu, the BBQ Beef and the Spam Masubi.
All are quite tasty.
I cannot wait to taste other items off the menu.
Chicken Katsu - I know this might sound weird, but this was probably the healthiest tasting Chicken Katsu I have ever had.
I think it was the quality of the chicken and amount in each bite.
I am used to a katsu that is mainly breading, so this dish was different from the rest.
The dipping sauce was awesome.
It leans towards the sweeter side which is a plus in my book.
BBQ Beef - The marinade for this dish was on point.
It was DELICIOUS.
I couldn't get enough of it.
Spam Masubi - I need to find out the recipe of the sauce the Spam was dipped in.
It was extremely good.
I will for sure be coming back.
I think next time I will try a pork item.

Not the best plate lunch i've had.
But being that it is local and their prices definitely reasonable, i'll be back often.
I tried the katsu and garlic shrimp.
The katsu sauce was kinda watered down but good nonetheless and the garlic shrimp was ok.
I dont think ill get the shrimp again though.
Just didn't seem worth it.
The BBQ mix plate is insanely huge and can easily feed 2 people, but being it was my first time here we got a bunch of stuff just to try out.
Next time its gonna be BBQ mix plate and the katsu.

Decent Hawaiian food on my side of town.
Love their chicken katsu curry!

I ate lunch here when my office was on Durango and it gets a little busy around noon to 2pm but the chicken and beef teriyaki is delicious and they serve Thai Iced Tea.

I ordered the BBQ mix plate for 7.95.
Definitely not the best Hawaiian food I've ever had.
Short ribs were tasty, chicken was bland, beef tasted like liver.
There are definitely better island eats in town!

I first discover this place by a friend.The very first time I had the chicken and beef combo.that's enough for me to get hook on this place.I also tried their chicken katsu,which is very good.The sauce is not too sweet or sour.it just perfect !

i only get the chicken katsu here or the chicken katsu curry.
Ohana is one of the few places that uses chicken breasts instead of thighs for their katsu which is great.
ive tried the hawaiian bbq beef which was a little chewy and the garlic shrimp was a tad oily.
i cannot complain about the chicken katsu curry.
However the curry is like a thai curry.

This was my first experience with Hawaiian food and I'm addicted to their Chicken Katsu Curry.
I get the mini as the full is just too much food!

The Skinny: the food - not with a ten foot pole!
(1), the service is crap (0).
Craving some Hawaiian BBQ after coming back from Hawaii, my hubby insisted on coming here for a taste Hawaii.
I tried the Kalua pork and my husband had the curry chicken katsu.
Although the portion sizes are enormous, I can't overlook the fact that the food isn't that great.
Just the smell of the Kalua pork was off putting - something about it made me nauseated.
The flavour was of over-seasoned canned meat.
The watery - yes, watery!
texture of the pork is an insult to the whole concept of salted roasted pork.
The chicken katsu curry was also watery and rather bland.
Given other great Hawaiian places so close by, it's hard to justify coming here.
FInally, FYI bring your own water if you do decide to try this place.
When I asked for a glass of tap water, the cashier woman said the only water available was the bottled water.
Then she proceeded to hand a plastic cup filled with watered down Thai iced tea to my hubby.
I'm not stupid.
You have plastic cups, you can fill it with tap water.
'Nuff said.
For that reason, this place gets a big fat one star - I would give it zero stars if I could.

It would be 5 stars if it weren't for the lack of seating and the long wait for the food.
This place a very popular, especially during lunch!
I recommend the following:  - Spam Musubi - Hamburger Steak Plate Lunch (With the Loco Moco you get egg, but one less hamburger patty) - Kalua Pork & Lau Lau  Bring a big appetite if you order the "regular," otherwise I suggest getting the "mini" instead.

This place is awesome!
I have been eating here regularly since I discovered it a year and a half ago, and I usually get the BBQ Mix Plate because I can not decide on which meat to order(they are all that awesome).
The only complaint is that it is horrible for my diet!
I used to think that L&L was the only place for Hawaiian, but they can not compare.
This is not only the best Hawaiian food I have ever eaten, but the best take out I have ever had!
Give it a shot, if you don't like it you're only out about $8.00.
I am pretty sure you'll love it though.

Eh... this place is so so.
I think I am pretty bias though, since I have been a fan of a particular hawaiian place since college.
The saimin soup is a 3-star... spam misubi is a 3.5 star.
The beef teri is 3 star.
Nothing that really stuck out to me.
But It is overall a decent place and affordable.

I kept passing over Ohana because it's right next to a chinese food place, and since I'm Jewish, well - that's self explanatory.
Chinese food won every time.
I've been sick all week, didn't want to cook, needed to eat something, and definitely didn't want chinese food.
I figured BBQ was a safe option; grilled meats and rice probably wouldn't tear my stomach up too badly.
I am SO glad that I came in to eat here.
I got the mixed BBQ; short ribs, chicken, beef, served with two scoops of rice, macaroni salad, and mixed greens.
Absolutely delicious.
The meat was flavorful and tender, I washed it down with pineapple-orange juice, and I had more than enough for a doggy bag to go home with.
All for $10.
I'm going back tomorrow to try some other stuff; I was extremely impressed and genuinely can't wait to try more.

Ding, ding, ding we have a winner.
From succulent BBQ pork and chicken/beef teriyaki to tender, perfectly breaded chicken katsu this place truly has Hawaiian BBQ down to a science.
Although every time I head in here this place is crazy busy I don't care because I just want to get the food in my mouth and don't mind waiting for it.
The service is quick and friendly, and they are always happy to explain any of the plates to you if you ask.
They also provide catering at what seems to be a pretty good price.
Can't wait to go back for lunch.

We were in the neighborhood of Ohana and wanted good food fast; not fast food.
We ordered the reg.
Chicken Katsu plate, bbq chicken plate and the teryaki bowl.
All were good and had more than an ample amount of food.
I will go out of my way to frequent this restaurant when I crave Hawaiian food.

I love this place!!!
The food is great, cheap and they give you a lot!
I always order the half and half.
I can never finish it and have to eat it again the next day.
Everything is good here.
I haven't had anything that I didn't like.
I especially recommend the garlic shrimp and kahlua pig.
The cute Asian lady is very nice too!
She's always so friendly and helpful.
Try the Thai tea as well, it's very refreshing and goes great with Hawaiian food!

I have tried them all and this is the best Hawaiian food in town.
When I want a taste of home, I go here.
The portions are large and a mini order will fill up most eaters.
The lady taking the orders is very friendly.
Expect a wait during peak meal times, but it is worth it.

Service is always good here.
This location is much smaller than the one in Henderson.
Food on a 5 star scale:  Fried Shrimp 4.5 Star They give you 8 big pieces, not too bready like L&L.
The mustardy tartar sauce might be too tarty for some people.
BBQ Salmon 4.5 Star Flavorful with generous pieces... sometimes.
Shrimp Curry 4 Star About 5 shrimps, with potato and carrots in a yummy curry sauce.
A little cincy with the curry though.
Kalua Pig 2.5 Star Dry and bland.
Kalbi 2.5 Star Too sweet  BBQ Chicken 2.5 Star Bland.
Macaroni 3.5 Star It's much better than a lot of places but not better than Zippy's.
Musubi 3.5 Star Where's the spam?
Nice hint of teriyaki sauce.
Malasada 1 Star Come on, we know your trick.
Pillsbury biscuits deep fried and coated with sugar.
Garlic Noodles 2 Star It was garlicy, but missing something.
Chicken Katsu 4 Star Golden Brown to perfection.
Manapua 3 Star It's all bread and hardly any char sui.
I'd rather go here than L&L or Island Flavor any day.

This is right by our house.
I've gone here a handful of times and keep going.
I feel like the the bbq beef or chicken bowl is a great deal for $4.95.
There plates have a ton of food.
BBQ, 2 scoops of rice, and macaroni salad.
I always....always get Spam Musibi!
So good.
The environment is nice.
Not fancy but, clean.
They have a flat screen that seems to always have sports on which is nice.
This is a good place for a quick lunch or dinner.
Anyhow, the food here is pretty good.
I wouldn't say it sticks out to be one of the best but, I'll keep going for more when I'm hungry or need a fast meal.

I wanted a loco moco and stopped by here since I saw it the other night when I went to 808 Sushi.
I was hesitant about going to L&L's since the ones back in L.A. are gross so I decided to come here.
I got the mini loco moco which was very filling.
A hamburger patty on some rice with an egg on top covered in gravy.
The gravy was pretty good.
My egg was a little overdone because the yolk was cooked.
It was good though but not great.
I'll have to try the katsu next time and maybe it will change it to 4 stars if it's good.

My tummy hurts  :(  We ordered using the online for for take-out, which was super convenient since I hate ordering food over the phone.
So anytime I can order online, I love it.
However, my problem came after the initial ordering.
We ordered as on the website -  Chicken Katsu - with macaroni, rice, with sauce on the site, on a bed of cabbage.
BBQ Combo Plate - with macaroni, no rice and no cabbage  Malasadas    The Katsu came with Macaroni on the side, no cabbage and no sauce to be seen.
The BBQ plate came on a bed of cabbage.
I don't mind that mine came on a bed of cabbage, and my boyfriends without, but the missing sauce was a big let down.
I had never had any of the BBQ items before (Ribs, BBQ Chicken and BBQ beef) and I really only enjoyed the beef, the ribs were ok, and I didn't know the BBQ chicken was all dark meat.
The Katsu was good like always, but could have used sauce ;)  Malasadas are always delicious, I just wish they came in half sizes.
There are two of us and we don't need 10 of them, 5 would be more than enough.
- I have gotten the Salmon in the past and generally enjoy it, especially considering it's price!
Next time I would order BBQ beef and Salmon combo.
If I order it again.
It has been over a year since the last time I had Ohana (or any Hawaiian BBQ) and both my and my boyfriends' stomachs are killings us right now.
Not sure if it is too much grease or something just not agreeing with us.

Last night, I ordered a Spam Musubi.
While it was made fresh, the nori was very dry to the point where it was like eating a dry sheet of seaweed.
It wasn't very impressive.
Also, I ordered the BBQ Mix plate and while the chicken was great, the beef was about 15% fat.
The serving size of rice and macaroni salad seems to have gone down to a shameful amount.
The macaroni salad was good... all three fork fulls of it.
No courtesy cup for water!
I was forced to by a drink.
The drink selection from the soda fountain is VERY limited.
:(  The price is much more expensive then other alternatives.
If it was not Monday night, I would've been grinding at Island Flavor right down the street instead.

Kalua Pig is with the trip alone!
Broke da mouth!

Better than L&L, nowhere near as good as Dakine's or Keilani's.

So went to order food for take out.
While waiting for food to be cooked, used the restroom and in there was another person.
Heard them use the restoom, did NOT here them use the sink.
And who was it that walks out of the restroom, an employee.
Not just any employee, one of the chefs.
Decided to let him know that he needed to wash his hands, but he thought likewise and ignored me.
So went to the front and let the cashier/ food orderer what happened.
She decided to argue for her fellow employee.
So after much arguing and debate I made sure that the dirty chef did not go any where near where the food was being cooked till I got my food and left.
If they don't think its neccessary for any type of food handlers to wash their hands after using the restroom then they are disgusting morons!
Never going back to this place!

Very good hawaiian food.
The katsu sauce is good and not too watery or BBQ like.
They have Hawaiian Sun too!!!
And their spam musubi is really good.
Overall I like it because it is as close to getting real Hawaiian food off the island.

I'm a coupon-attic!
I got a buy 1 get 1 plate lunch free coupon from the entertainment book.
Sadly it could only be used on a mini plate.
That's ok, saved me $7 (wich paid off my book.
NICE).
If the friendly service don't have you coming back for more, definitely the garlic shrimp will do the trick.

very good hawaiian bbq chicken i always order hawiaiian bbq chicken its the best~better then any other teriyaki or the bbq chicken places wont hurt to try!

I use to live 2 blocks from this place and I would eat here at least once a week I LOVE this place!
I usually ordered the Chicken Katsu full order, OMG the chicken is tender and juicy and the breading is just right but what really got me was the sauce mmm mmm good so sweet and delicious.
Sometimes I would order the combo plate half BBQ Beef and half Short Ribs which came with two huge scoops of rice and macaroni salad.
The rice is nice and fluffy and the macaroni salad is sooo sweet and yummy.
The food is high quality and the portions are sooo generous you can actually split a plate with someone and still be full that's how generous there portions are.
Also the staff is very friendly and service is fast they always had my order ready for pick up when I got there.

I remembered seeing this place a while back when I was eating at 808 Sushi nearby.
Months later, my husband and I finally decided to try it out for lunch.
I ordered the Pork Lau Lau and Kalua Combo with 3 scoops of rice, since I was never a fan of macaroni salad.
(And no, I did not eat all that rice, LOL!
) The Lau Lau was nice and steamy, and tasted great.
However, every time I eat these, I always wish there would be more meat stuffed inside!
The Kalua Pork was weird because it was very watery.
I am from Hawaii, so I know that it should not be served that way!
I decided to give Ohana another try when I was in the area again.
This time I ordered the BBQ Mix Combo (again with 3 scoops of rice).
It came with: BBQ Beef- about half of it was burnt pretty badly.
The few pieces I had that were edible tasted good, but the meat came with a lot of fat.
BBQ Chicken- full of flavor, cooked just right, and easy to eat.
It was the best part!
Short Ribs- the meat was kind of hard and it was pretty flavorless.
The restaurant was clean and the employees were very polite.
Overall, I think they are about the same as L&L.
If I ever come back here, I would only order the BBQ Chicken plate!

My Hawaiian food spot, when ever Pure Aloha festival or Lei day isn't happening and I'm craving Hawaiian.
This place hits the spot.
*What I usually Order*  Chicken Katsu: 4/5 The chicken is breaded tender and juicy.
Their Katsu sauce is a lot different than most Hawaiian places I've gone to.
I usually don't order chicken katsu because of how heavy some places drizzle the katsu sauce but this place finds a great balance.
Short Ribs: 5/5 Even the mini is more than enough for me but when I want extra left overs I get the full size.
The short ribs are cooked to perfection super soft and a bit chewy but it falls off the bone ever so easily.
It comes with vegetables, rice, and macaroni salad.
The whole dish comes together perfectly.
Drinks: 4/5 Hawaiian Sun Passion Orange is soooooo good definitely a drink to top off delicious Hawaiian food.
Very refreshing especially on a hot Vegas day.
It's served in a can that they keep in a cool fridge & its super cheap I just wish there was more in a can lol  Service: 4/5 This is a hit or miss most of the employee's are really nice especially this young man which I think is the owner because I think this is a family owned business.
Which makes it better, but when its busy depending on who you get they can seem a little snappy.

It makes me feel bad when I criticize small, family-owned establishments.
On the other hand, fellow Yelpers also deserve to know about my experience as it might help someone avoid frustration and disappointment.
1)  Do not go there expecting it to be quick.
It took 22 minutes for my order to arrive and it was a very basic order -- a BBQ chicken bowl and a musubi -- which are staples at a place like this.
It was painfully slow and for no apparent reason.
There were 2 people ahead of me in line when I got there.
There was nobody else waiting around for food.
They had been open about 15 minutes.
2)  Re customer service.
I stood there waiting and was obviously getting antsy, but received no acknowledgement.
Instead, the lady at the counter avoided eye contact with me.
Finally, after more than 15 minutes, I asked about my order, thinking maybe they'd forgotten it.
She curtly told me that mine takes awhile to cook (really, a chicken bowl?
) and it would be coming soon.
After 5 more minutes, she finally handed me my bag, without saying a word.
3)  The meat on the musubi was the thinnest I've ever seen (of hundreds, if not thousands, that I've eaten in my life) and it was overcooked.
Fail.
4)  The chicken bowl was okay.
Tasted like your basic chicken bowl.
Not a lot of chicken, though.
I wasn't expecting much since it was a bowl and not one of the plate lunches, but still, it was pretty skimpy.
Enough for me, but if you're hungry, be forewarned.
Overall, despite my love of Hawaiian BBQ, this was a bad experience.
But I suppose if you're in the neighborhood and craving it, and you have a lot of time and low expectations, it would be okay.

For a "fast food" hawaiian bbq place, Ohana satisfies my craving for plate lunches (especially when Island Flavor is closed).
They have your usual plate lunches of teriyaki chicken, chicken katsu, mix plates of beef, galbi, and chicken and other plates of seafood.
I think that their chicken is actually the best thing on the menu as it is extremely juicy and flavorful.
The recently had the beef mixed plate and it was ok, but I think I will be sticking to the chicken.
You also get 2 scoops of rice and 1 scoop of mac salad (if you order the regular portion) and you can also substitute veggies (for an additional charge of $0.50).
Good place to grab a fairly large meal for under $10 when you are craving some hawaiian food.

I really like this place.
I actually like it more than L&L.
I've tried a bunch of entrees here.
My favorites in order are:  1.
Chicken Katsu 2.
Short Ribs 3.
Chicken Katsu Curry 4.
Pineapple Crab Rangoon 5.
Gravy Fries 6.
Saimin  I love the portions too!
The mini is huge!
Oh and I love the Thai Tea Boba too but sometimes the lady isn't consistent with her Thai tea and milk ratio.
Haha

I haven't had anything from here besides the salmon, which was alright.
But, I LOOOOVE their Thai tea with boba, its my favorite.

Ohana is located in one of many many MANY strip malls in Vegas.
A good stop for a quick bite to eat, or to take something to go.
Had the Chicken Katsu and the Mixed BBQ dish (which includes a bit of Short Ribs, BBQ Beef, and BBQ chicken).
Both dishes came with mac salad and rice.
Both were REALLY solid dishes and the portion sizes are ridiculously huge.
I think two people could have been decently full off of one dish.
At decent prices, fast service, ginormous portions, and great food, why wouldn't I come here again?
Definitely would like to try their thai iced tea or boba next time.

I came here on a Wednesday in the early evening with cravings.
I had the mini loco moco and was a very happy girl.
With the "mini" loco moco, you get the following: 1 egg, 1 beef patty, 1 scoop of rice, and 1 scoop of mac salad.
It was good enough for one person, or maybe two people on a diet.
Definitely don't get the larger meals unless you are sharing or want to save some for later.
I don't like mac salad, so I can't tell you how that tasted, but the rest of my dish was tasty.
Flavoring was right and tasted almost like I was in Hawaii.
Also, I had great service here.
: ) I'll be back!

I come here at least once a month for lunch, being that I work near by.
I normally order the loco moco.
Its very good and filling and taste just as if I got it from Hawaii.
Their macaroni salad is made w the perfect mayo and seasoning  My lunch break is an hour long and it takes them just 10 min to have it ready to go.
I recommend anyone who's craving a good Hawaiian style loco moco plate to definitely order it here.
Haven't tried anything else only because I don't want to miss out on the loco moco plate.
It gets me every time

If you're looking for Hawaiian fast food, that's it.
It reminds me of the mall kiosk back home kind of fast food.

It been while since the last time came here for plate lunch action.
Since L&L opened up been more partial too going there for my local kind plate lunch.
Not that I have any problem with Ohana and still don't because they still do great job!
Tonight felt like mixing it up change something I try too do with food.
I ordered one of my favorite plate lunch chicken katsu.
Good.
The difference between L&L and Ohana the chicken katsu.
Ohana it lot less greasy, same token some reason felt like chicken was dried out not as moist as normal, and the mac salad L&L is way better.
But in all still love my local food Ohana is place that would go back too or mix things up once in while..

WOW!!!
Mmm short ribs and Chicken Katsu...
BOMB!!!!
Amazing food amazing price, and such a friendly staff!

This place was better than I expected.
Some people wrote bad reviews.
I was hungry and this was the closest place to eat.
Food was delicious and came in good portions.

Service is awesome very friendly...
Besides the Pineapple Chicken being horrible i love the Mac salad and the Katsu Chicken was yum, and the Chai Tea with BOBa.
YUM!!!
Im giving it a 3 star because Island Flavors and Aloha Kitchen right down the road is a little better but also a little more expensive.

Delicious food and huge portions.
There was a line out the door on a weeknight, so it must be good.

This used to be part of my lunch rotation when I worked in the area, and it was always tasty.
Ordering ahead of time can save yourself a LOT of trouble as this place gets packed during then.
Like, line out the door packed.
Fairly small inside, so if you want to order and dine-in, be prepared to get comfortable with your companions.
There are also not a lot of seats, so I'd avoid coming here with a large group unless you're OK with sitting at different tables.
If that happens, just enjoy the HUGE picture they have of Waikiki Beach on the wall.
=D  I usually get the curry katsu chicken because I'm kind of obsessed with it.
The small plate is more than enough for me, and it's around $6 or $7 which isn't terrible.
Their macaroni salad is slammin', yo.
Mmm.
Thai tea here is good, not too sweet like it can be.
OK selection of the Hawaiian Sun products, wish there was a bit more though.
Spam musubi is good, too!
But if a Hawaiian place screwed up Spam musubi, seppuku should be imminent.

Tasty food, generous portions, excellent prices, quick & friendly service.
No complaints, I have never had a bad experience here and have always enjoyed the food.

Have always loved and favored Ohana Hawaiian BBQ!
Service is always nice and sweet and the cooks know what they're doing!
I've been to Island Flavor, their katsu chicken is a lot more crispy/crunchy and I was not likin that lol.
LOVE the salmon here and their katsu chicken and grilled chicken is delicious!
Will always go here!

Great food for a low price.
Check it out.

I'm a big fan of Hawaiian BBQ.
I'm from Hawaii and that's no surprise.
I came to this location the same night I visited Cold Stone.
There was a super long wait at the creamery, so I stopped in Ohana for a couple of musubis.
The great thing is they only cost $4 total!
They put some tangy teriyaki sauce in the musubi.
The spam slices were thick and the best part:  the nori seaweed is crispy.
That means it was fresh!
The only thing that turned me off was the girl that worked there.
Her sentences were prolonged by an irritating emphasis on her vowels and S's.
I don't mean to be a jerk, however, I was super turned off by this.
She was nice, true.
Maybe I wasn't in the best of moods.
Hopefully on my next visit, I can better assess this situation.

Never disappointed here.
I like their chicken katsu better than Island Flavor's.
It comes with a better sauce & the chicken is all white meat as opposed to chicken thigh at Island Flavor.
The garlic shrimp is flavorful and each shrimp is plump.
YUMMO!

Chicken Katsu or BBQ short ribs is definitely the way to go if it's your first time, also try a Thai tea boba.
All really good items on the menu.

I use to eat here all the time when i lived closer, i'm still not that far just lazy.
The portions are big and prices are reasonable.
Staff is pleasant and efficient.
I usually get the Hawaiian BBQ Chicken (mini plate)...one scoop rice one scoop macaroni salad and 4 thin slabs of chicken for 6 $.
I was stuffed!
It was all cooked perfectly and it was delicious.
I don't know why I stopped going.
This trip convinced me that I must return!

I ordered a noodle bowl and some breaded shrimp.
The bowl was small and barely had noodles.
The breaded shrimp was dry, hard, and tasteless.
This place was a waste of money and I left hungry.
The food is better next door at the 808 sushi place or at Hawaiian Flavor.

Chicken Katsu is delicious!
They have some pretty tasty macaroni salad.
Yum!

How sad that this restaurant with pretty good food decided to cross over to the dark side.
I have been a regular customer for nearly 5 years, but as of tonight, I am done.
I will not spend money where they cheat their customers.
All of a sudden they are trying to charge an extra $.50 for credit card transactions less than $15.
That is greedy, unethical, and an illegal violation of banking laws.
If they want to make more profit, they should raise their food prices, not impose an illegal charge on the smaller customers.
Shame on the selfish owner who has decided to become a thief.

Had the BBQ mixed combo plate.
You get a lot of food for the money.
It tasted pretty good too.
I want to try the spam masubi next time i eat there.
it looked good!

Price is right.
Portion size is right.
Food is ono.
I like it and definitely recommend it.

I like catering from this place for big gatherings.
We usually order a pan of mixed meat and macaroni salad.
Garlic noodles and spam musubi are always everyone's favorite.

Our go to place when we're craving local cuisine in the 702.

This tiny restaurant is so adorable.
I was impressed of how clean the bathroom was.
Clean bathroom = clean kitchen.
The restaurant is just right on their prices.
Their portions are huge!
I always order the chicken katsu when I eat at Hawaiian restaurants.
Their chicken is white meat, but it's not dry.
It's rare for Hawaiian restaurants to use white meat.
Their sauce is kind of watery, but it's still good.
I'll definitely come back.

Best Hawaiian spot in Vegas :) I love it.
My favorite is the Chicken katsu, spam musubi and the macaroni salad!

Fast dependable service.
It's your typical Hawaiian flavored foods.
Very consistent with taste and portions.
Every time it's satisfying.
Try the garlic shrimp!
Mmmmmm

Good Hawaiian style food.
Chicken Katsu and Spam Musubi always great!

Great local food and serving local sized portions.
Had the Loco Moco, the Seafood mix, some Malisadas and Portuguese sausage Misubis...Ono stuff.
Everything was hot and fresh, even the Malasadas at 1430 in the afternoon!
very fair pricing for the portions...5 $ for ten Malasadas!
Will be back every visit to Vegas!

Gotta say, food is alright for Hawaiian local food, but old Asian lady gotta not run register...lmao!
And seem like haoles only get served faster...

This place is your typical Hawaiian Plate Lunch restaurant.
It's my "go-to" place for what I consider some of the best Chicken Katsu in town.
I think it's my favorite because whenever I order it, its never burnt, undercooked or anything like that.
From what I can tell, it's breast meat but unlike other places that use the breast, the meat is NOT DRY but instead really moist and tasty!
The teriyaki beef is good as well.
I just wish they were open 24 hours... ;)

Just had lunch there with the homie.
The place was busy and the service was quick.
I had the BBQ beef bowl with a side of Mac salad.
The veggies were prepared nice and al dente, the meat was tender and flavorful.
My buddy had BBQ beef lunch and with two soft drinks it was all less than $18.
I will definitely be back.

My favorite Hawaiian restaurant in town!
Me and my boyfriend are frequents here and the older lady that runs the cash register is always nice and very genuine even when it's super busy!
I always get the chicken katsu (five stars) and my boyfriend gets the BBC beef (also five stars) an extra plus they have cheap Thai tea with Boba!

It's the oddest thing - I never thought I'd enjoy a strip mall "Hawaiian BBQ" joint, especially more than Hawaiian BBQ restaurants in town, but I really do.
They just do it better.
Of course, nothing really compares to home, but when I have a hankering for Chicken Cutlet (Chicken Katsu with brown gravy) or Kalua Pork with Cabbage, it is delicious.
These two dishes are really all I want to eat when it comes to Hawaiian BBQ, so that is how I gauge the taste and quality of Hawaiian restaurants.
Their chicken katsu is moist with a crispy breading, while their gravy is very tasty.
I love that their Kalua pork is moist with tender cabbage, and delicious juices.
Their plate lunches come with consistently tasty sticky rice and their Mac Salad is satisfactory.
Huge portions for under $10.
Service is also very quick.
I called my order in during my last two visits and the food was ready within ten minutes.
FYI: There is a $0.50 charge for credit card transactions under $15.

STAY AWAY!
Food is now mediocre and expensive.
Business practice is still unethical:  i ordered $10 of crappy food (spam musabi) and used a credit card to pay.
Without even telling me this time they added on the 50 cent credit card fee.
It's obvious they only care about money, not quality food or customer service.

We used to live down the road from this place and we hit it up AT LEAST twice a month.
Soooo good!
As a girl who spent a good chunk of her childhood/teenage life on the north shore or Oahu, I know my Hawaiian food and this place is bomb.
Not much for ambience but its cute and clean with really good service.
Their kahula pork is out of this world and their MAC salad is divine.

Not a bad place, but not the best.
I usually get a Loco Moco, BBQ mix, or Katsu/Cutlet, with the occasional spam musubi.
I recommend getting a regular size meal over the mini, because it really is mini.
The regular sizes are about double the size of the mini for about a dollar more.
Its a small place, not really ideal for a family dinner, but more for a quick bite or if you don't feel like cooking at home.
I'll stop by here if I'm in the area, but I've been to better Hawaiian places.
ps.
They have a $15 minimum for card which is A LOT considering their meals are $6-8 on average, so carry cash.

This is my go to place for fried shrimp.
Always tender on the inside and crispy and tasty on the outside, never greasy.
I also like their chicken katsu and spam masubi Always generous with their portions and great service.
If you want a little taste of Aloha this is the place to go.
Happy Eating  xoxoxoxo

My favorite go-to place when I need my chicken katsu or BBQ chicken musubi fix.
The place is a bit small and can be really crammed during their busy hours.
Aside from that, they have a big selection of food and also offer boba milk tea or thai tea as well as Hawaiian sun drinks.
I usually order the chicken katsu with gravy or sometimes with curry depending on my mood.
I can never go wrong with gravy!
The chicken is always very crispy and whether you order the mini or regular, you're getting a lot of food.
As for the curry, it's usually a hit or miss.
It's not the best sometimes but I really love their chicken katsu so I can eat that by itself.
I also am not too fond of the macaroni salad that comes with each dish but you can replace it with more rice.
The BBQ chicken musubi is my new favorite musubi!
Ever since my mother-in-law brought some home for us, I really can't go back to spam musubi (unless it's the only option of course).
2 can make me full so the portion is a decent size and it's perfectly wrapped.
Overall, the staff is also always friendly and they are usually fast when it comes to service.
I always find myself here with my friends when we can't decide what to eat.
You get your money's worth here since portions are so big!

Gosh I love this place.
The mac salad is delicious, the rice is always perfect, and my hubbs requests their bbq chicken weekly.
The staff is friendly, the food is always hot and delicious, and they are quick about it!!
A+ in our book!!
Note, the restaurant is small and hot (temperature), you might want to consider taking it to go.

Quick and friendly service in a small store.
Whenever I dine-in, I try to sit in the back because the tables up front are so close, every time someone walks in or out, there's always a cold breeze.
On their food-- Their spam musubis are always thick, however they can sometimes be dry/lack a good amount of sauce.
Their mini kalua pig plate are good enough to satisfy me, but I'm a pretty small person, so I would suggest a regular.
Omg, their malasadas!
Perfect.
They're very consistent: always have a thick, crunchy outside layer, but once you bite into it they're so soft and moist!
Yum.
I hate teriyaki chicken, but when my mom brings home a plate from this location, I don't mind digging in.
I would spend my money for drinks elsewhere though.

I come here very often with my friends and family, and I must say that this is probably the most delicious Hawaiian food I've had in Vegas.
It's relatively close to my house so I like the location.
My all time favorite is the BBQ mix and Katsu Chicken.
I definintly reccommend this place if you're looking to dine Hawaiian.

Food awesome, (bbq chicken bowl and bbq beef bowl) so fresh!!!
so much flavor.place is very clean all employees very friendly and attentive!

I didn't feel like driving to island flavor so I decided to settle for this instead.
As I was eating my take-out at home, I found a full sized fly in my gravy (posted in photos).
I should've drove the extra mile to island flavor instead.

I knew something tasted funny when I ate here I forgot to write a review but I got food poisoning from the Kalbi in December just be careful what u order here I definitely will  ever go back!!!

The food was amazing and the service was very quick.
The many different plates makes it a one stop shop to fill you up for sure,

I liked it here!
I loved the prices even more.
It is a cute small place and the people are so friendly.
Food is good and service is quick!
If you want  good Hawaiian food for great price you'll like it here!

So upon moving into the south west side of Vegas, the only Hawaiian restaurant I knew about was Island Flavor.
It wasn't until one Sunday afternoon that my boyfriend came home with food from here and we haven't been back at Island Flavor since.
Don't get me wrong though!
I love Island Flavor, but Ohana Hawaiian BBQ is in walking distance from my house.
Their BBQ mixed plate is delicious - it's my usual go to order if I'm not wanting anything else.
Their chicken katsu is amazing along with their kalua pig.
Some people aren't a fan of macaroni salad.
I, on the other hand, LOVE MACARONI SALAD.
The one from here I on point.
I get really iffy when ordering boba from a non-Asian place so I was skeptical when ordering a Thai tea from here...
BUT!
I was proven wrong.
The Thai tea here is just as good as any other boba place which makes me extremely happy because now I am just walking distance away from fulfilling my Thai tea craving.
BIG TIP: Order ahead of time if possible.
The wait here can be very long if you come at the wrong time.
I was ordering dinner here for myself around 9 o'clock on a Tuesday night and ended up waiting at least 25 minutes.
Did I mention how small it is?
You add on the possible long waiting time and crowded area.
You'll probably be eating your meal with a stranger waiting for their order RIGHT next to you.

Best Hawaiian food I've tested  Near where I love.
Love this place, Combo plate is my favorite!

I have found my new Hawaiian place to grub at, and it's only a 30 second drive, woo-hoo!
I was madly craving some spam musubi, so I pulled up my handy dandy yelp app and this place happened to pop up first.
The only problem is that it was already 10 after 9 and they were closing in 20 minutes, I decided to give them a call anyways and asked if I could place an order, to my surprise, the cashier said yes.
Most places turn you down so I was extremely happy.
I ended up ordering the loco moco with a spam musubi on the side.
I got to the restaurant and there were about 5 people waiting to get their food, so that's a good sign, still busy late night.
The cashier was really friendly and I got my food very quick.
The loco moco was amazing!
The gravy wasn't as salty as other places I've been to, and the macaroni wasn't overpowered with mayonnaise, phew!
The spam musubi on the other hand, could have used a bit more sauce, it was a bit too dry for my liking.
Other than that, everything was great!

Haven't been in a long while.
Disappointed in their Katzu Chicken sauce.
It's like they watered It down and all the breading was falling off the chicken when I opened up my box.
Still good but disappointed as it used to be my favorite place for Hawaiian BbQ.

One of my favorite places to eat in this area!
The garlic shrimp and BBQ salmon is my favorite.
Upon reading reviews I found out that you can get all veggies instead of rice.
I like the rice occasionally, but the macaroni salad is a must have!!
