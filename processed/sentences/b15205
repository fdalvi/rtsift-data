DISCLAIMER- I normally hate chains and fast food and don't even spend energy on reviewing them.
But this particular Dominos deserves a fair 3 star review based on the following-  technology- its pretty damn cool you can order and customize your pizza online and then watch a time line of it getting made.
Seeing all the options on a screen in front of you really gives you the chance to play around and personalize your pizza.
Then there is a little time line that lets you know when the pizza is getting assembled, baked, then ready for pickup.
crust- they actually have a pretty tasty crust.
Its buttery and garlicky.
value- coupons for 7.99 3 topping pizza?
I can find change all over my house for that!
Are the ingredients of the best quality?
Of course not.
Is the service amazing?
Hell no.
But is it A-OK especially for a super lazy night when you are broke?
YES!

Ordered online, and estimated time ready was off.
Waited an extra 20 minutes past estimated time.
Pizza and wings were good, cashier was friendly.
Not bad.

Ok Dominos you have come a long way!!!
I am SO happy that you have gourmet and gluten free pizza.
I was scared to try it as most gluten free pizzas are not that great..
I ordered the 5 cheese Wisconsin on a gluten free crust and it was awesome.
You make feeding two boys easy.
Thank you..   Oh and I love your online ordering and I signed up and you can see who makes your pizza and what process in creation it is very cool.
Nice job for a chain...
