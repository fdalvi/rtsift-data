I will not go any where else to get my precious Mercedes tuned up and fixed.
The staff is always courteous and always knowledgable about everything.
They truly have a passion for what they do.
They are always honest and wish to keep you as regular customers.
It's unlike the dealer where everything is expensive.
Eurocar Center is where I have becoming since I bought my Benz.
I will continue to come here when my garage is full of Benz!
I love cars....so should your repair shop.
Definitely worth the drive no matter where you are coming from.
Plus they have candy.....caaannndddyyyyyyyy....delicious candy.
Haha!
Anyway?
FIVE STARS!

I also will never go anywhere else again!
They have all the factory equipment, knowledge and experience needed to repair Mercedes and will do a better job than any of the dealerships or garages.
I wish I would have known about this place years ago!!
They are honest and go above and beyond.
No need to go anywhere else.
Pass the word Mercedes lovers!!!
Thank you Euro Car Center!

OMG, the best place to take your Mercedes.
Sam rebuilt my transmission, and put in a new starter, and replaced the rear seal, and installed new valve cover gaskets, and intake manifold all for an amazing price of $3,500.
Saved me AT LEAST half of what Schumacher European would have charged me.
I'm putting Sam in my will:-) I love this guy!
