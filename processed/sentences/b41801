Nice place.
Everything looks clean and fresh.
A little hard to fine but it is sandwiched between Jimmy John's and five guys burgers.
A little bit of a wait but worth it for healthy options.
The fresh juices and bowls are priced reasonably.
Be sure to ask for 'light ice' they got a little heavy handed with it on the drinks I ordered.

Walked into this plsce felt very cozy.
The staff was very knowledgeable of products and what's good to eat.
They offer a Cleanse where all u do is drink the six bottles throughout the day, and u don't eat.
U can have raw almonds.
The one thing I noticed about the ingredients was they are fresh fruits and veggies.
(Kale, ginger, spinach, coconut) etc.
......  for the six bottles of the Cleanse it's 48 dollars.

Their place is always clean!
You get the swift scent of healthiness as soon as you walk in.
Their acai bowls are great.
I'm not so big on the juices (I cant be THAT healthy), but their smoothies are my jam.
Always a great substitute to a lunch when you don't have time/are dieting.

Stopped in while I was running errands on this side of the valley...Nice staff, great juice.
Too bad I don't live closer!
