Please don't shop here.
I bought a conure and his wings were clipped when we got him.
They were clipped way too high and they actually cut his wing.
Poor birdy.

My mom and I have browsed the gentlemen in the "scooter" store at least (5) five times in the last 3 years and never bought a single thing.
They were polite and hospitable ( all the staff).
We bought a beautiful 3 month old cockatoo Sunday 8-25-13 for $1100.
Got free toys and food and an awesome cage with wheels.
He even gave us an extra discount for paying cash.
LOVE THIS STORE AND STAFF.

I browsed this store looking at toys for my eclectus parrot.
The owners are really friendly and their birds are happy, healthy and well cared for.
