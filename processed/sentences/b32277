There is nothing as nostalgic as a ride on a carousel.
The best part is that they have been running a free Carousel ride offer most of the summer.
The smiles that my girls give when they start going round and round is priceless.
Nice location with lush green grass around the carousel at the district.

I went about three or four times this summer when they were running it for free.
I would still have paid the $2 to go around once.
It's a nice lunch in the park kind of thing.
I would recommend going around, or before, noon because the heat and there are less people.
My 18 month old daughter loved it.
The lady was super nice and did not make us get off every time.
We would go around and pick new animals.
