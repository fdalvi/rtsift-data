I like this place, they have facebook & games on a big screen right at your table, strong yet tasty drinks and lots of ping pong tables to the side.
Great place for happy hour.

Formerly Sandbar, this is a great new spot in Central Scottsdale to chill out after work.
Good Mexican food, good strong drinks, and a massive outdoor patio with pleanty of drinking activities.
They also have plenty of TVs to watch the big game.
FYI - It gets slammed on weekend nights...

I've only been once since they converted to Baja from Sandbar.
Let me go ahead and detail ALL of the changes they made with their transition:  *  They changed the sign.
Yep.
That's it.
The entire list of changes.
That being said, it is a good beach bar.
The do live music on the patio, and have cheap drinks.
We were there for the Nameless Prophets show, and the place was rocking.
I will return...

I went for the first time with some folks from work to play ping pong.
the place was fun, service was great, food was great and the other customers were cool when the occasional ping pong ball landed on their table.
Everyone in the place seemed to be enjoying themselves.
