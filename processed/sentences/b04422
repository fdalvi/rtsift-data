Although the resort was nice, we were severely disappointed in the customer service.
You would think that paying good money for a timeshare would result in a little more attention from the staff.
We complained and the resort manager did offer us a few nights stay for free, however since this place is a 6 hour drive for us I don't know that we will ever be able to use it.
We appreciate him trying to make is right, which is why I won't give them only 1 star.

The place is pretty nice so that's not my beef.
The service sucks sucks sucks.
Over priced for the wrong service and they will not refund anything.
Go elsewhere.
