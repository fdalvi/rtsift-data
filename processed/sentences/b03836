chinese food is few and far between in the phoenix area, or so i am told.
this place is just eh.
i got the teriyaki chicken.
the chicken seemed like it was boiled, so the texture was bland, then the sauce was just plain.
sweet, no particular taste that wowed me.
i expect a grilled taste when i get teriyaki, so i was really disappointed.
i got the rice bowl option.
so they had the rice, then a pile of shredded cabbage, and then the chicken.
i spent forever picking the cabbage out.
who puts cabbage in a rice bowl?
my friend got the sesame chicken, which tasted like a light sweet and sour with sesame's on top.
it was good, wish i had gotten that instead of my selection.
it was very cheap.
the lunch special was $3.95 for the rice bowl and $4.95 for the combo (soup, egg roll, a couple won tons, and fried rice).

Decided to have Chinese food last night, so I called Chen's to order Singapore Chi Mei Fun and potstickers.
I told them that I would pick it up in about an hour...she was puzzled.
Told her I was working out at the gym and I would stop by after.
The cost of the meal was about $15.
Got home  opened the container of noodles and the aroma is what I remember from San Francisco.
It had a good mixture of meats and just the right amount of heat and was large enough for me to make two meals.
I opened the potsticker container and they were half the size that I'm used to seeing.
But the flavors were there to satisfy my palate.
I don't know why they gave me a container of rice...cause I all ready had the noodles...
The workers there need to smile a LOT more.
They didn't look happy to see me.
They were way too serious for me.
When you go to a restaurant, you like to be welcomed and  the workers  friendly and not business like.
Besides that, out of the three Chinese restaurants in Fountain Hills, this is by far my favorite.

Tonight it was a bit chilly out side and I wanted some type of hot soup.
I decided to call Chen's and ordered their WOR WON TON NOODLE SOUP.
It warmed up my inner SOUL.
Wor means "everything", the soup had shrimp, won tons, sliced chicken, green leaf vegetables, sliced carrots and noodles.
I picked up my order ten minutes late and when I got home...it was still piping hot, just as if it was just prepared.
One thing, I wish there were more green vegetables.
So on a COLD night, I recommend this dish.
You won't go wrong.

Since it was COLD on Friday, my wife and I decided to go to Chen's for lunch.
I don't know why we didn't think of Pei Wei but this restaurant is much closer to our house.
My wife ordered the Chicken Rice Bowl and I ordered the Chicken with Rice Noodles off the Lunch menu.
It came with egg flower soup which was nice an hot.
When my meal came, I can't figure out why they would give me fried rice with noodles...double the starch.
I really enjoyed it.
The egg roll was made with just vegetables...so, so.
But I didn't like the fried Won Ton which was crispy on the outside but REALLY dry on the inside.
Can't complain for two hot meals under $10.

Reasonably priced dinners coupled with a lunch special that is a steal, Chen's Garden offers a quick solution to the average Chinese food craving.
The service is quick and reasonably friendly.
The atmosphere is nothing to write home about, but the restaurant is clean and comfortable.
Fountain Hills has been waiting for this affordable alternative to its typically overpriced options.

great prices, great tea and AMAZING FOOD!
the combo plate is AMAZING and fills you up and well priced!
I love coming here!!!

We love this place!

Great value for lunch.
It a 'dive diner' meets 'chinese restaurant'.
FOOD: Food was good.
Not amazing, not awful, but pretty good.
ATMOSPHERE: Very, very small dining room with dusty 1980's decor.
SERVICE: We placed our food orders and the waitress walked away.
We had to call her back to remind her that we wanted drinks also and she seemed bothered by this.

my favorite restaurant.
i always get the coconut curry chicken with bamboo shoots.
its honestly the best thing EVERR!

In a land of 3-star mediocre Chinese restaurants, this is a 4-star mediocre Chinese restaurant.
The atmosphere led me to think it was going to be nothing special, but I was pleasantly surprised that the food is good (I ordered shrimp chow mein).
At just over $10 with tax, it's just about the cheapest dinner around too.
The atmosphere isn't gross or anything; it's just generic China-dive.
I'm still searching (nationwide) for the Chinese restaurant that blows me off my feet and enters me into a new category.
I can just feel that there's going to be some type of organic Chinese place somewhere that just does me in and tears down the rankings of every Chinese restaurant I've ever been to.
For now, to me, places like this are the "best of the worst".
I enjoyed my meal here, so I'd recommend it if you're in the area and craving Chinese food.

I was shocked that I could get good take out of dine in Chinese food so close to home!
I was lucky to have had fast service on this busy weekday.
The special was Pine nut shrimp and it was excellent.
A nice amount of shrimp, albeit they were probably farm raised in Thailand, and great assortment of vegetables other than onions!
It came with a few crispy things and a side of soup.
The hot and sour was just right and had nicely chopped small amount of veggies in it too.

yummy

The food is very good and very reasonably priced.
The atmosphere... well, there really isn't any.
Service was very efficient though not friendly but the food is great and the lunch specials can't be beat.
Less than $15 for two including tax for a delicious lunch.
I'll be back, friendly service or not.

The best Chinese restaurant in Fountain Hills.
The lunch specials are pretty amazing.
You get a cup of soup (either hot & sour or egg drop), a wonton, spring roll, small side of fried rice, and your entree.
And....it's about $6 or $7 with a drink.
Dinner-wise everything is pretty fresh and tasty.
I have had a plethora of items here.
My favorite is the Kung Pao tofu and their egg drop soup is really really good.
The west lake soup is really good, but it has meat in it.
Atmosphere-wise, this place lacks severely in that department, but who cares if the food is good.
I like this place for take out.

Love this chinese restaurant,  I am almost going weekly now.
Its mostly americanized chinese but if you want something different I would go for whatever the daily special is.
Best time of the day to come is for lunch, for 5-6 dollars you get a good sized portion served with fried rice, an egg roll with fried wontons and a cup of soap.
The outdoor seating area is quite pleasant and I have never had bad service and they place is always clean.
Atmosphere is a little outdated but for the price its kind of expected.

This place is not good.
If you're Asian you will not like this place and think this place is very Western.
The owners clearly cater to the White clientele of the area.
Nothing here is authentic.
For example I was served Pringles with my salt and pepper calamari.
I wouldn't recommend this place.

I don't write reviews, but I had to so that people would know this place is NOT a 4 star worthy Chinese restaurant.
