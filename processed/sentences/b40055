Fitbody boot camp is the best!
All the instructors--Stephanie, Lauren, Mike, Angee, Mike K., and Sheila--are great but I love attending Stephanie's classes the most!
Their workouts are intense but they teach you the right way of doing them and they push you so you get the best workout you possibly can.
Classes are small and it has a friendly atmosphere to it.
I never thought working out can be this fun.

I love it!
I been going to the gym for a few years and getting a " so called " workout but then I seen a voucher on living social and decided to try it.
I am so glad I did, the instructors are great they, and will push you to YOUR limit.
I'm in my fifties and thought I would feel out of place but I am very comfortable and enjoy the workouts each week.
Everybody is so friendly and the classes are small.
I would highly recommend Fit Body BC, don't stay in a rut with your workout find a voucher on social media and give it a try.

I saw a deal on Lucy Vegas for 1 week free & me and my friend decided to try it a few nights ago..
This was seriously the most intense work out we have ever had.
I definitely want to sign up with a package.
This is the first work out that I got that soreness.. LOVE IT!

First time coming here today.
Kicked my butt!
But wow!
Good equipment.
Great instructor.
Great workout.
The gym is small and so are the classes but it is more personal which I really like.
I will defiantly be bringing my friends!
They have a great deal on groupon right now too!
