Its very hard not to leave this place without a bag full of stuff.
When I needed Drinking glasses for my wedding reception I came here and bought several cases of glasses for a price that was almost cheaper than fancy plastic bar glasses.
This place is awesome.

Always changing, if you find something you like, buy it that day!
Odds are it won't be there when you go back.
There are some great deals to be found here.
Everything for the home, and then some.
Employees are super helpful.
The clearance areas are spread out, and those deals are better.
Most of the time it's small blemishes that are hard to spot.
Great store, check the, out.
Give them 2 tries before you write them off,  because the inventory changes.
Like the changing inventory, each store is different.
Peoria is more empty (customer wise) than the other locations I have been to.
:).
Happy shopping!
