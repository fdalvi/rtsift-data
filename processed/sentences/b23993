SORRY SORRY SORRY I went for the All U Can Eat Fried Cod today (Friday) at 5:30pm.
At 5:55pm I requested two more pieces of fish.
The waitress said they were out.
Say what?
This is FRIDAY All U Can Eat Fish day?
She said but we're out of fish.
Then why did you charge me $10.99 twice for two people that DID NOT have ALL the fish U can eat?
Damn America!
Wake up and quit treating people like their return business doesn't matter.

Chicken fried steak, bread pudding...
Outstanding!

Not sure how they can do so much advertising and brag about how good their fish/cod is and have it served hard as a rock after being held under a heat lamp for I don't know how long.
Terrible.

There was a "For Rent" sign on the door as of 7/15/12.

Let's just some it up as disgustingly dirty.
Nasty all the way around.
That explains why they are now out of business.
