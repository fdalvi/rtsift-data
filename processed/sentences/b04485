This is a Dairy Queen like all the rest.
Good stuff but it HAS NO DRIVE THRU!
A Dairy Queen w/o a drivethru is almost as bad as a DQ w/o ice cream.
Seriously!
Whaaa waaa waaa.
It's stupid.
Otherwise it's just like any othe DQ.
It's friggin busy most evenings, especially after dinner.
I'd give it 4 or 5 stars but once we rolled up on the store 5-10 minutes before closing and they had the door locked.
KIDS!
It sucks being denied ice cream.
Maybe I should give them 2 stars.
Nah... most the time its a regular 'ol DQ.

Solid DQ.
Had a delicious blizzard served by a pleasant counter person.
No reason not to enjoy a little soft serve deliciousness here!

This place is a nice one to come and get ice cream with the family.
Clean and always good service.
My girls love their ice cream!!!
