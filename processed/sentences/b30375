We bought a house in September and had a fantastic experience with Lynn Price.
We had a house fall through earlier in the year so we worked with Lynn on two houses.
I would highly recommend Evergreen Home Loans to anyone buying houses in Las Vegas!

Scott Reynolds at Evergreen helped us get the home of our dreams.
He and his team were fast, efficient and amazing!
I highly recommend Scott and his team at Evergreen.
