very efficient service,  staff was nice, i didnt have to wait 2 hours like at a repair shop.
my smog was done in 5 minutes :) would recommend this place 100%

The young man working there today was really really nice.
From start to finish the whole process was maybe five minutes.
At the end when he ran my debit card and I got the slip back asked if there is somewhere to tip.
He said that it was too late and not to worry about it.
I felt really bad and I said are you sure we can run it again, and he said the fact that I came in was plenty enough with a warm smile.
Overall really really nice guy clean facility, will be going back again next year.

I am very excited to have found Issac and the Smog Box for my car service and repairs.
Issac has performed an emissions check, emission system repairs and routine maintenance on my vehicle.
Each time I have been there, I have found him to be very professional, friendly and proficient.
The pricing is very fair and I have been recommending the Smog Box to everyone I know.
