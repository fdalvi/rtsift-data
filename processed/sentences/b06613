I typically don't write reviews but I just had the best phone call with a MG & E representitive I had to come and rave about it.
Upon calling the customer service line I was directed within (quite literally) 2 seconds to a very friendly representitive who was very helpful and informative while I was trying to change my service location.
Keep up the good work MG &E customer  service.

Great phone service & support.
Friendly, quick and helpful at sorting things out.
Even when I was out of state for personal reasons, I called MG&E, said I didn't forward my mail.
The kind midwestern voice on the other end never missed a beat; "Oh ok, no problem.
You've always paid on time", they put a note in my file that gave a generous extention, though I ended up not needing it.
Along with phone there's an online payment, mail (old school), and pay in person at various places.
The automated credit-card bill payment line adds a $5-6 fee.
They also have a solar program if you have a roof.
Now, if those surges could be taken care of...or is it just my building's messed up wiring and routing?
