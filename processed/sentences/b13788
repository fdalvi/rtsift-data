With the new low prices comes cheaper ingredients.
The flavor is NASTY!
When I asked for my money back, they gave me attitude from someone named Parland

We just went and got one of the new $7.99 pizzas-after reading the other review-I thought well it might be the last.
OMG-we loved it and we will do it again.
We all thought it was great!

Dominos.com says the store is open until 11 o'clock.
I called at 10:45, waiting on hold for 15 minutes, and nobody picked up.
What gives?
Also, the website won't let you place an online order if you live in Tortosa.
Yet they will deliver when you call.
This is been an issue for years, and I've asked them to fix it several times.
Their only solution is to have you place a take-out order online, and then call them and have them change it to a delivery order.

I love the sandwiches here.
I don't think I've ever ordered the pizza.
My order is always correct and ready when I arrive.
There is no dine in option.
Carry out and delivery only.

THE second worst-tasting pizza I've ever had, the first being Basha's deli pizza which actually made me sick.
The only reason I didn't give it one star is that I managed not to vomit after eating a slice!

Bad service  After 20 minutes trying to order 2 pizzas off of the Dominos' website.
Every time I tried to make my order it would reset and make me start again.
I called the manager of the store to tell him about the website.
His reply to my complant was basiclly what ever.
I have 3 hungry kids screeming for pizza and no sorry or comp.
anything.
There are a lot of places to eat and pizza (fast food) shouldn't be this hard.
