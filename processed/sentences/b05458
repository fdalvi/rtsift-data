Some of you may remember Sushi House Manda from back in the day when they were located on West Sahara Ave, near the World's Largest Gift Shop.
Since then, they've moved west to South Ft. Apache Road, sharing property with Doc Holliday's Saloon.
If you're like (the old) me, you're probably wondering how fresh fish can be sitting in the middle of a desert.
Now before you get your panties in a bunch, give me a chance to show you some pics and explain...
This all-you-can-eat sushi powerhouse has gone through major upgrades to create the ambience that you will find at their new location.
When you enter the building, just turn left to see what you've been missing (Doc Holliday's is to the right).

I do remember!
One of the best sushi places I've ever been too.
Unfortunately, I don't think business was good for them when they moved here from their old spot right off of Sahara.
Yes this place is closed.
:(  I want it back!!

Yes this place was the best I wish Jimbo would re-open again in las vegas.
I live in LA but my friends and i would fly in just for the sushi here.
It was the best, little rice, big slices of fish.
tasty roles.
To bad the new smoking law had them close shop, it was inside a bar at Doc holidays.
The all you can eat was the best.

I looking for Jimbo or Leslie or any of the old crew.
Please email me.
I been eating at Manda since I was 16 yrs old in the early 90s.
I was a regular until moving away to the Phoenix area.
After many trips back to Vegas for Jimbos sushi and to see family I was sad to hear the old place was closing until a new place was found.
I recieved an email from Crystal I believe and was told the new location.
We headed to Vegas for some sushi.
I was amazed when I walked in at the new look.
It was beutiful!
After going there for a few times when we were in town me and a few friends found out the hard way they were closed.
Some time short after life threw me a bad one and I spent almost a year in one hospital or another from AZ to MD and now left disabled for some time.
So my point is I lost touch with all of them over time.
I was told over a year ago that Jimbo was at some place on Decatur but I don't remember where.
If you can email me if you know where I can find Jimbo I would treat you to Sushi.
I'm serious!!!
Miss you guys so much.
You all were more than food to me and were a big part of me being raised and growing up in Las Vegas.

Jimbo has been found!
Thanks to a few of you that emailed me a while back.
Jimbo is now at "Sin City Sushi" located on Eastern and the 215.
The place is very good and friendly as well.
Jimbo has brought many of his cuts and rolls with him here but many are missing giving way to the owners menu.
You still can get your special scallops fix but many of the other cut rolls and hand rolls are not the same as we use to know it.
Still very good and worth the visit!
They offer all you can eat as well as Ã€ la carte along with some cooked beef, fish, chicken, and noodle dishes.
The tempura is great!
Not on the all-you-can-eat menu but a must is the "Star Roll".
I recommend the trying: Paradise roll, Girlfriend Roll, Vegas Roll, Baby Tako, baked clam, and Oyster Shooters..
They also almost always have both halibut (hirame) and red snapper(shirome) and are the freshest I have ever had!
They also offer many different and newer (to most folks) cuts such as "white tuna" or "super white"..
I believe the proper name is Escolar.
