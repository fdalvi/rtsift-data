Where do we begin with a testimonial for Lisa Buzelli?
With nothing but positive feedback, it is hard to know where to start.
My husband and I are absolutely thrilled with the service we received from Lisa.
We started working with her about 9 months ago (our first thought with a move to the Las Vegas area) and she, from the beginning, has been ever so helpful.
My husband is active duty military and with this we had a lot of back and forth with trying to accomplish our goal to get to Las Vegas.
Lisa was always very patient....and even when we had to take a break from house hunting due to our military situation and uncertainty about whether or not we would actually make it out to Vegas, she checked up on us.
Lisa wanted us to know that if we ever had questions or concerns that she would be available to us.
Lisa never left us in the dark.
She was there for us and she cared about finding us our dream home and dream location.
In a market that is being bought up by investors, it is difficult to find a first dream home in a dream location.
You fall in love with many, but many come unavailable.
Not to be discouraged- Lisa works hard, and she cares.
She cares about her clients.
Specifically, she cares about our family and she cared that we find a safe location fit for our lifestyle.
We found many homes we loved, but Lisa helped guide us to a location that best suited us.
With us living out of state during the house hunting process we needed a realtor to get to know us and go that extra mile.
We did not know the area and we had no idea where was safe and where in Las Vegas would suite our needs as a family.
Lisa got to know us.
She wanted to find us our perfect place.
We are now happy and we are now home owners.
More than just handing us our dream home, Lisa has gone above and beyond for us.
We are currently still out of state, and have needed help with putting final touches into the home buying process and she surpassed what her job description would entail.
No need for fine details...but I can assure that she has done more for us than what any other realtor would ever dream of doing.
We have been blessed.
Lisa found us our perfect home in one try.
The home we purchased was the only home we saw in person when we came to Las Vegas to house hunt.
She got it.
She got US.
We took it.
This was our first home buying experience.
We could not have asked for a greater one.
We feel absolutely blessed that Lisa was introduced into our lives as our realtor and now friend.
We hope that this testimony can give any sort of insight as to who Lisa is and how much she cares for her clients.
We are more than pleased and extremely blessed.

The best place to be a agent in Las Vegas

Do NOT do business here!
The agents can swindle their vendors and the broker could care less about returning your calls.

We were referred to Laura Hauck & Steve Hauck by a friend of ours who had sold a home using them as their agent.
They had such raving reviews about Laura that we figured we would be smart to give them a call.
We are still amazed at the dedication to finding us a home that not only met our needs but also our price range.
We wanted a pool which was a must have for us.
My husband and I were able to stay exactly in our price range & the home exceeded our expectations.
Laura and Steve went way be on the call of duty in so many ways.
I would Highly recommend them to anyway who is looking to have a great experience in purchasing- or selling- real estate in Vegas.

Suzie Marquardt is the best Realtor we've ever met: honest, attentive and working relentlessly to get you the best deal possible.
We only wish more people are like her and the World would be a better place!
