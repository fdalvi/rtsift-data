Simplicity.
Corn dog, fries and a large lemonade.
For $10?
I'll take it!
dip the dog n fries in some ketchup and follow it with a sip of lemonade.
comfort food all the way.
I also like they cook everything to order.
service is friendly and polite.
if your ever craving a corn dog..forget those frozen microwaveable kind.
Get your butt to your nearest hotdog on a stick location!

Someone please update these poor folks outfits they have to wear to work here!!!!!!!
Other than that, the dogs and the cheese on a stick are simply yummy!

The food and drink is always exactly the same.
This review is based solely on the customer service...
I've worked in customer service for over 20 years.
People are a$$holes.
Plain and simple.
It's not this guys fault you didn't hear him call your name twice because you were taking selfies at your table.
It's not his fault I was in line before you and your job only allows you a 15 minute break.
Don't ask him how much longer till you get service when I'm standing there paying my bill.
You're rude lady!
And sometimes you're really busy and there's no more orange lemonade for 5 minutes.
Get over it!!!
These kids don't deserve your condescending, holier than thou, attention starved bad attitudes.
With a smile, this young man was calm and took every rude comment.
He even apologized to ME!
He sat there while you took out your crappy life on him.
These people , YES THEY'RE PEOPLE TOO, deserve just as much respect as the next guy.
Think about that next time you're having a bad day and be nice, get your cheese stick and shut up!
Didn't catch his name.
I assume it's  Shawn L. from my receipt.
Tall, skinny, dark hair and glasses.
You're doing a phenomenal job!
