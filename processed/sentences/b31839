Most awesome cruise I have ever been on.
There was plenty of micro brews and superb food.
The whole boat seemed to have the time of their life including our party of people.
I could easily say that it was the best three hours I have ever spent in Lake Las Vegas.
I would recommend anybody to go on it.

A cruise aboard a beautiful boat full of local beers, beautiful people, and killer BBQ.
How could you not have a good time on the cruise?
I have to say that I really enjoyed myself aboard the brews cruise.
The event host were awesome and were making sure that everyone was having a good time.
When they come back to do the next cruise, I will make sure that my girlfriends and I are gonna be on it.

It's not a yacht...it's more like a hot box bastardized pontoon boat.
Beer was nothing spectacular but the food was good (mainly just the spirit infused cocktails).
Too many frat kids on this boat...
