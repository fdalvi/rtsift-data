A wonderful, if tiny Pub.
Oodles of varied Real Ales on tap.
Great selection of Whiskies.
They pour a great pint.
This time , I had a lovely pint of Scottish Brewing's "Houston Warlock Ale".
It was delicious with a hint of coffee and fruit .
Most times I've been it's been standing room only, however, today I actually got a seat at the bar and watched the Cricket on the HD TV.
If you like your Beer, this is the place to visit.
Thoroughly recommended.

Beer or Gelato?
Hmmm.....  We stumbled upon Staggs on a hat wearing walk-about from Musselburgh races.
However, our leader for the night knew exactly where he was going.
And how apt since we were actually on a stag :-) The truth was I was really looking forward to a pistachio ice @ S.Luca's before the no.26 bus back to Edinburgh, but am I glad we stumbled upon what some would call the volunteers arms?
Yes!
Staggs is a small lively ale bar that any Camra member would be proud to rest his (or her) rather large posterior.
In fact it's been their national pub of the year on several occasions in the past.
And it's not surprising with the array of fresh, ever revolving ales on tap.
I think my tipple for the evening was a Tempest ipa and how enjoyable it was, especially quaffed with warm banter.
So after a couple of hours discovering new beer, ribbing locals on Edinburgh football's demise and arguing about the best hat to wear, we were soon ale'd up and it was time - sadly :'( I never did get to S.Luca's, but maybe the next time I'm in E.Lothian?
However I may get waylaid?
And as we all know beer and ice cream just don't mix :-\
