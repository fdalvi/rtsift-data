This was my first time in a print shop since probably 2006, so when my printer decided to go on the fritz and I had a million things that needed printing, my husband suggested going to kinkos.
Thankfully when I typed in kinkos.com into my browser, it defaulted here.
It seems like most things are do-it-yourself, but if you need assistance, the guys working behind the counter will come out and help you.
I was a little confused at first but figured things out pretty quickly.
I just needed to print things off a flash drive, so I found a printer, put my flash drive and debit card in, and everything came up on a little screen.
I was concerned that I was going to have to reformat everything so I was happy that it showed me the print preview before hand.
If you have to print more than one document then you have to select "start over".
When you are finished, hit "done" and your debit card comes right out.
There is another machine where you can put money onto a FedEx prepaid card, but that must be if you are using cash.
They have a decent selection of office supplies, envelopes, folders, paper, etc.
and a stand of books on leadership and work related topics.

As soon as we pulled up someone came out to help us with our boxes!
Great and friendly service!
