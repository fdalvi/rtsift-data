No one likes going to the dentist, but I really don't mind when I go here.
When I first moved to Phoenix I was lost when choosing a dentist so I just found one online.
I went to a visit and I felt like I was constantly being sold treatments that I didn't even need.
Then I found Scottsdale Dental Studio and I was very pleased with the great service and friendly staff.
If you need a dentist give this place a try :)

I found the doctor at Scottsdale Dental Studio to be honest and straightforward.
The staff was excellent, the office was meticulous and the prices were affordable.
I would recommend this office.

These guys are awesome, I used to go to their other location in Phoenix, but I moved to Scottsdale recently and thought I'd give this office a try.
The staff is super friendly and I feel like I get very personalized care.
I have my whole family coming now too.

5 star service from the moment you walk-in until you leave.
I highly recommend Dayna as a Dental Hygienist, she is caring and gentle while also making sure you get an excellent cleaning every time.
Debra at the front desk is always on top of reminding me about my appointments which is very helpful with my busy schedule.
I've seen two dentists here and both were excellent.
Check out Scottsdale Dental Studio, you will not be disappointed.

I have been seeing Dr. Gilbertson for 5 years now.
He is very personable and easy to talk to.
I am pleased with his staff and glad he was able to establish a successful partnership with Scottsdale Dental Studio.
