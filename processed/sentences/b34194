This store was mostly clothing for men, but it did have vinyl.
So this is my review on the vinyl section only.
BUYER BEWARE!
You are being ripped off.
I'm a record buyer.
This is my job.
I know my shit and what I don't know, I look up (yes, there is a blue book for vinyl collectors).
I picked up a Todd Rundgren album and this place was trying to charge 90 bucks or so for it because it was a first pressing.
First pressing or not, it was only worth 20 bucks at the most.
We sell it for 2 used.
The clothes seemed overpriced and generic also.

We came into the John Varvatos store in January.
There was so much great clothing for my boyfriend.
We live in Chicago (where there is not a JV store) and we were traveling with small carry -on luggage.
The store manager, Adrian, was not only very helpful in picking out the clothing, but he also shipped our new purchases back to Chicago.

Modeled after the CBGB Bowery store and featuring the complete collection of John Varvatos and Varvtos USA plus a small selection of lifestyle items like books and Vinyl this is high end done right.
Understanding that Varvatos clothing is not for everyone, often times priced well outside of my range, there is no doubt that the man is running his company right and as one of the better American Men's designers I remain a fan, picking up pieces when sales or circumstances allow.
