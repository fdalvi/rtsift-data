Probably the best pedicure I've had in Glendale.
Super fast, and a great price.
The place was clean, the staff was very nice, and they did a fantastic job.
Plus, since two of us came in and got pedicures at the same time they gave us a voucher to come back.
The gel nail polish is $22 or $20 M-W, which is a great price.
Would definitely come back again and recommend to anyone in the area!

Good prices, specials and coupons.
Defiantly will be returning

I love this salon!
When I moved to the area I tried several salons and was always disappointed either by the crappy work or by the outrageous prices.
I ended up trying here simply because either was near my home and it is amazing!
Frankie always does a great job on my acrylics, and the price and quality of their pedicures are unbeatable.
The only reason I rated 4 stars is because they always seem to have only one nail tech so if he is busy you are stuck waiting.
But it's worth it!
