I've walked past the Soup Factory numerous times on my way into Barriques.
I decided to finally stop in yesterday.
Now, as you can guess, this place's focus is....SOUP.
They do have a wide selection of salads and sandwiches(both hot and cold).
I decided to try the chicken and mushroom stew, and half of a caprese sandwich.
I really like it when I have the half sandwich option, so I don't feel stuffed to the brim adding a soup.
The stew was really good, almost as good as my fave at Java Cat!
The sandwich was decent, but nothing amazing.
It's pretty easy to smear pesto on a slice of bread with tomato and mozzarella and squeeze it on a griddle!
I'll definitely be stopping back in to try another soup this fall/winter!

The soup wasn't bad, but the guy who was serving it was really creepy and totally ruined the entire experience.
Plus, they were out of my first and second choices even though they were supposed to be open for 2 more hours.

I didn't know what to expect from The Soup Factory, but I liked what I found!
I visited around noon on a weekday and the place was hopping with what seemed to be a local business crowd.
I ordered the Cheesy Caprese sandwich and loved it.
I sampled some of the soups as well and all were good, but maybe not great.
There are about 8 different varieties of soup to choose from each day, everything from different chilis to stews to bisques--you won't get bored.
And a regular menu of salads and sandwiches is available.
Friendly, hard-working staff.
