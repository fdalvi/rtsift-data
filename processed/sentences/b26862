Stopped here by chance the other night just looking for a quick bite to eat.
Staff was very friendly and service was very quick.
Sandwich was very fresh and tasted great.

Always a great sandwich at this location.
Seems like a high turnover on employees but the service never suffers.
Wonderful rewards card program.
Seems like I'm earning free sandwiches all the time.
One of my old reliable eateries.
If I had any complaints it would be the cleanliness of the tables, those could use some attention.
Normally I take out but it was hard not to notice today.

Great service.
My family makes weekly trips to this location because of their service.
Blue and Vic are the best!
Thanks for some great sandwiches!
