The idea for Third Thursdays is a great one, but I don't think it is catching on like First Fridays in downtown Las Vegas.
Third Thursdays occurs every third Thursday of the month on Water Street, a few blocks north of the convention center.
It was around 5:45pm when I went, and the street seemed to be dead.
I couldn't find the art gelleries at first, but after a bit of walking around jail bond businesses and antiques stores, one appeared.
Why aren't they advertising!?
So frustrating.
Anyway, once I went inside there was a nice table complete with store bought brownies and bean dip.
Surrounding this table was a small art exhibit.
I am assuming the only four people there were the artists themselves.
A man played (tinkered with) a guitar and another man was making some piece of jewelry.
There was a box to place a vote for you favorite piece of art you saw, so I participated.
I think I was the first vote in the box.
The funny thing is that if Third Thursdays was advertised or marketed AT ALL, I believe a nice size crowd would show.
City of Henderson, please listen: we need more events like this, with bigger crowds and more excitement.
This is a great launching point, but give it a bit more "oomph" and let peeople know about it!

Third Thursdays is such a good idea in theory!!
Henderson is really such a cute downtown area, and with so much change impending and high hopes for the future one day this third Thursdays will be really great and busy.
The last time I went, I was the only one walking around.
Also, art needs to be down there because A6 is the only gallery that is really doing it right!
It will take a couple years to catch on!
Keep on working!
