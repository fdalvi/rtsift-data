Great store!
It was closing time and I just needed to pick up one item.
The manager was so nice and let me in to grab what I needed.
He went an extra step to help out a customer when it would have been easier just to say "Sorry, we are closed" and shut the door.
Even though it was after hours, ALL of the staff were in a good mood and very friendly.
Also, the store is clean and well put together.
Lots of merchandise.
Good location in the Arrowhead area with tons of other shopping very close.
From the phone rep to the manager to the cashier all of the staff is super friendly and helpful.
I will definitely keep shopping there....!

Always great deals to be found!

The Rack is my favorite place to shop.
This Arrowhead store is great, because it is better organized than other Rack locations.
It is easy to figure out where things are located and sizes almost always in the correct location.
Highly recommend

They have a lot of clothes and good shoes.
Definitely one of the better racks I have been too.

I Absolutely LOVE this place!
It is so much more than what I expected, its organized, neat and clean with High-end Fashion!
The lady that checked us out, Helen, was sweet and helpful.
We even had to return a pair of sneakers and with NO questions asked, we exchanged them...Gotta Love that!
I will definitely Return!

I don't think I'll be shopping here anytime soon.
I bought two very nice shirts that I was only able to wear once!
I was very disappointed.
The day I bought the shirts I washed them and then wore them later that week.
As I was wearing the shirt all of a sudden the beads on my shirt started falling.
I tried to stop it but the string they were on just kept coming undone the more I tried fixing it.
I ended up just taking the shirt off.
The same thing happened with the other shirt as well.
I will definitely not spend my money here again.

First they don't carry any tall sizes.
Americans are getting taller - proven fact.
Please carry tall sizes.
I bought two Calvin Klein pillows today and when I got home and removed them from the zippered case, I noticed Both pillows have been 'marked' in some attempt to not allow them to be returned or something.
The Bar code on the 'Do not remove tag" has a black marker line through the bar code on both pillows.
The Calvin Klein tags on the pillows have been cut through (double sided)  to 'mark' them that they were sold at Nordstrom Rack vs. Nordstrom, I guess.
This makes NO sense to me ....
Even though I bought them at the "rack' vs the full service store, you SHOULD NOT have defaced the pillows and especially not the logo.
When I wash them, I am sure the tags are now going to fray and unravel.
Thanks Nordstrom ........
Thanks.
Ironically the package lists the now defaced label as a selling point :  "Signature Linen Label" the package boasts.
I shopped for a pair of mens jeans here today .... did  I miss something?
$119 jeans marked down to $100 is your 'outlet store' price?
15% off .... what a joke !!

This place can be highly frustrating at times, because it often gets too crowded.
However, if you come here first thing when it opens, then it's not so bad.
I'm glad to finally have a Nordstrom Rack on this side of town, because I hated having to drive all the way to Scottsdale Road to get to the next closest location.
To shop here, you have to be really in the mood to shop and filter through things, because although there is some organization, there are still mixed clusters of similar things on random racks.
If you really look hard, you can find some "gems" though.
My intent of going shopping today was to find a mother's day gift for my mother-in-law.
I wasn't even planning on going to the accessory section, and hidden among the bag racks was a Kate Spade tote.
I looked online and the tote was still selling for $165+.
However, this store was selling it for less than half that price.
Score!
It's always hard for me to find unique things and clothes, but sometimes, I'll find those unique items here.
When I'm at the regular Nordstroms, I find alot of things I like, but I just don't feel that some items are worth the money, but IF they somehow make it to "the Rack" and IF they have reduced to a more reasonable price, then sometimes, there are things that can be found and worth buying here.
You just have to invest the time...

Place is great for Jean, at least it was for me.
Found a couple of $150 designer jeans for $75 and my wife found a ton of stuff too.
You have to stop in every 3-4 months to see new stock since the men section is not huge but they stuff they get isn't bad for a discount store with designer names.
We spent an extra 30 minutes in line setting up a Norstrom account with my wife's debit card so we can get $40 to spend and $100 credit toward alterations...so my jeans were altered for free.
Waiting to set it up was annoying and I never get how wasting 30 minutes of a customers time is worth a stupid card for some sort of credit.

I'm so happy that this location is open.
I think the store will do very well in this neighborhood!
The selection is smaller than other Nordstroms racks I have been to but it still very good!
The staff here is very helpful and friendly.
I like how they just started a new "speed check out" you can actually just walk straight up to any of their team members wearing a green shirt and check out with them instead of waiting in line.
(kind cool I thought)   I'll be here often i'm sure :0)

You gotta love Nordstom's Rack!
Great selection of high end cloths and shoes and, usually, about half price.
AND you still get to enjoy the wonderful Nordstrom's return policy so you never have to worry about returning ANYTHING for any reason.
For instance...
I bought a pair of very nice Hugo Boss black loafers last week.
I wore them for a full day and got a blister (I'm used to Bruno Magli or Too Boots).
Remember these are leather soled and hard leather upper shoes, so when you wear them you can certainly tell.
Not a peek.
Returned them with a smile.
Nordies...
I'm smitten.

This location is not great but not bad either.
Hence, the 3 stars.
The selection is not as broad or high end as the Scottsdale stores, but that just has to do with demographic.
I have on occasion found things at this store that were priced cheaper than the Scottsdale store.
So that's a plus.
But honestly, when it come to the brand selection you think of when you hear Nordstrom, this is not the best of them.

Fantastic selection of shoes.
I love the fact that they have a lot of choices especially for smaller sized feet!
A lot of them were reasonably priced as well.

This particular Nordstrom Rack is pretty organized.
Most I've shopped in can be a mess.
I went during the week so there wasn't really a crowd.
Wish there was a bigger purse & accessory selection.
Also, I'm not sure if it's just me but this store seems smaller than most NR's.

Where have I been that I haven't visited Nordstrom Rack until recently?
Shame on me!
Great prices and great Nordies tried and true items.
I particularly liked the kids section.
Great clothes and REASONABLE prices.
My kids are looking great at prices I can afford.
The staff was super nice and very professional....and I could get my receipt emailed to me.
We will definitely be back.
Thank you!
