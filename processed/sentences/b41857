They have really really good food!...but really poor service...but there food makes up for that its good.
The portions are on the small side so dont get confused and order one plate to share (like other thai places) because you will starve, and the Thai Tea is really good but there is no refills (like other thai places)..but all in all ther food is really good, and the place is decorated beutiful

Amazing staff!
Great food.
Usually go to the location in Las Vegas but this place is just as great.

I'm torn between how yummy the food is or how poor the service was.
I came with a family of four and ordered the pot stickers appetizer coming with I believe 6 pieces?
I also got the ck pad thai, the Kung pao ck, and yellow ck curry.
But I waited a little longer than an hour and an half for my last dish!!!!
Plus they brought our dishes two at a time so we all were eating at different times..
Such Ridiculous service.. We called out to the waitresses and waiters about 3-4 times yet none of them "heard" us.. Another table also didn't receive water until 30 min after being seated!
There is a lot of patience I have as a person but over an hour an a half for some "wonderful" food.
I cannot..
So!
If you like Thai and don't mind waiting foreverrrrr then here is the place to go (: & if not?
Make sure to have bunches and bunches of patience.
(Btw.
As a girl the only thing that frustrated me less?
Was the hand scrubs in the BR.
Lol.

Portion sizes are arguably not equal to price.
I order Pad Thai anytime we have Thai.
Period.
It's like the benchmark I use to compare one restaurant versus another.
The pad thai here has been consistently dry and just lacking.
Other dishes seem..meh.
Nothing horrible, but nothing to write home about either.
If you want solid, overpriced Thai food, this place is ok.
But if you want more bang for your buck and perhaps higher quality Thai food, there's lots of other options out there.
