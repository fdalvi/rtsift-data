It's Subway.
This one is good, clean, etc.
Make sure you say a lot or a little mustard if you get it, otherwise it will be a LOT.

Unfortunately, today was the last day for the $2 6" subs.
We bought 4 6" for less than $11 -- not bad.
I don't really like subway but this was an exception.
I wish they had more choices especially for veggies.
There was a new girl there so the line was kind of held up but that's okay.
The cashier guy was kind of funny; gave me a chuckle on the way he was responding to his manager.

Loving their new sammich & it's a trip to be able to call ahead & have your sammich ready when you get there.
Kudos to you!
Excellent & friendly service

ive been to a lot of subways in my life but this has to be the  best.subway.EVER!
they really meant it when they said, "eat fresh!

Stopped in for a few subs to go.
This is one of the best subways around.
Good job Stephanie!
