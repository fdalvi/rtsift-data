Top Notch Care!
I had shoulder shoulder Arthroscopic peformed by the BEST Nathan Richardson!!!!
Kind, Gentle, Strong and Professional!!
The Staff his assistant/nurse was the Best as well.
If I need ANY bodypart worked on suegically it will always be CORE no mattter where I am I will fly back for all my needs..Hopefully no time soon ;-)  The Core Really sticks by it's "core" values...This is the Route folks!!

This place was not very comfortable feeling and seemed very restrictive.
What was the point of putting on a paper gown and feeling like a doofus for not knowing how to put it on , then having it rip.
Not a good experience.
The Doc was knowledgable but demanding to the staff.
Didn't really show respect for the rest of the staff.

Most disgusting attitudes from staff and Dr's.
And treat you with no care or feelings and very discriminating.
