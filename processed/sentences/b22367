The gentlemen at the Tire Factory are true gentlemen.
I had a problem and they solved it..I needed 4 new tires immediately for my car.
The tires, though no exotic are not necessarily easy to find and I braced myself for the bill.
They got the tires right away and the cost was really reasonable.
The service was impeccable and I went from, Great no car at 8am to driving myself to lunch by noon.
Chandler Tire Factory is locally owned, the owner is a great guy and though I'm not slashing my own tires to go back, I highly recommend them.

Stright up & honest!!!!!
After I took my vehicle to other shoe makers that were not qualified to work on a Big Wheel I found this place.
The gentlemen in this establishment don't play around, absolutely flawless work at half the price of any other shop in town!!!!
If you read my other reviews you will see places to stay away from.

Had two rims that were damaged and needed to be replaced.
I had purchased the rims online and wanted original tires remounted and balanced.
I called Saturday morning, and was told to bring it in.
The price quote and work done was excellent.
I will definitely be using this company in the future.

Brett, the owner & his staff are always Professional and courteous and have worked on my Jag and my Chevy.
The mechanics all do great work.
They also have no problems with taking me to work and picking me up.
IT is a great place to take your car and their prices are very low.
Brett is very honest and treats his staff well - his father even helps out!
