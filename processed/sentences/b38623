This was our second year at the salsa festival.
We had a blast!
This year was much more organized than last.
Although, last year they gave everyone a ticket to vote for the best salsa...
This year the vote was based on tips.
I think the ticket system is much better.
They don't gouge the drink prices, which is awesome.
The buttered tortillas are delicious!!!
(My favorite booth ;))  I also won some free stuff too, yay!

I have been going to the Salsa Challenge since I was 6 years old.
It has grown from a tiny little salsa challenge in the parking lot of Aunt Chiladas to a huge event at Tempe Town Lake.
While still a wonderful event that benefits a very worthy cause, there were a few things this year that were disappointing and need some improvement.
The first is the shade issue.
It gets hotter and hotter every year.
It was a blistering day this year.
I feel that they should have provided more large tents for people to take shelter.
There were people crammed under trees to relieve themselves from the sun.
The only other escapes from the sun were the VIP tent and the margarita mixing event tent (which was not appropriate for families).
Speaking of the margarita tent, that is another issue.
The last few years my husband and I have had phenomenal free poured margaritas at the margarita tent.
They had a few varieties to pick from.
The chambord one was great.
This year they only had two varieties of pre-mixed margaritas.
LAME....
Apparently some city head honcho did not like the party atmosphere of the tent.
(Which until this year was 21 and over) Now anyone can get into the tent and listen to the funny but highly adult bartending contest and auction.
The chip situation was another issue.
Every person gets a ticket for ONE tiny bag of chips.
My husband and I felt very constricted with our chip rations.
We were a little anxious not to waste our chips on bad salsa.
Like Gordon E. also mentioned, there "hot" varieties did not impress my husband.
I thought there were many good salsas however.
And the vendors were having fun.
The Groupon line was lame as well.
It sucked having to wait in 2 lines.
Hopefully the organizers will take these criticisms to heart.
