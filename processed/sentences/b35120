Great product and great service.
For those of us on a budget this is a great alternative to spending thousands of dollars on expensive countertops.
Would highly recommend this product and Stonelike Refinishing.

I recently purchased a house and I hated the laminate countertops.
I wanted them to have the granite look, however I couldn't afford the granite price.
I started looking into different options and found Stonelike Refinishing.
It is a unique process that uses your old countertops but trandformes them into new countertops.
It gives them a textured rock like look and feel and costs a quarter of the price as new tops.
The reason I am giving 5 Stars is because of the customer service from Ariel and Dulce the owners of Stonelike Refinishing.
They were excellent from start to finish.
The countertops look perfect and I get tons of compliments on them.
Also Stonelike Refinishing offers a 5 Year warranty  which cannot be beat.
Great product, Great customer service, Great Company!!

My countertops were in really bad condition but I  could not change them before because it was really expensive.
Finally I was looking through  the Internet and found their website.I call ,they came and did the job , my kitchen looks finally great.
IAriel and Dulce explain how to take care of my new counters It is a 5 year guaranty .hurray for Stonelike Refinish

We have 6 ft double integrated sink vanity made of cultured marble from 1978.
Considered replacing entire vanity and top but my wife did a beautiful job refinishing cabinetry so we decided to keep.
Looked at concrete overlays, and complete replacement alternatives.
All were very expensive.
We found Stonelike Refinishing on internet.
They offer a special formula spray-on system that looks very much like natural granite or many of the engineered stone countertops.
We were reluctant at first, since there other paint-type systmes on the market that we thought looked a little chincy (I know it can be a matter of taste).
We are very pleaseg with the finish applied by Ariel and Dulce, the principals in the company.
The quality is ecellent and at a price point that is affordable in comparison to available alternatives.
Their method fills in the seams between he top and side splashes, resulting in a clean, smooth integrated look.
With proper car, I expect to enjoy our new vanity for many years,   Ariel and Dulce are a young ambitions team sharing a passion for their unique approach .
They are excellent at explaining the product, the installation process and  the cost of the job.
Communication is excelent before, during and until job is comple to client satisifaction.
We proudly recommend Sontelike refining.
PS; Since Ariel wants to do a complete jog right, it is necessary to remove drain flanges and faucets.
For me, this was the perfect opportunity to upgrade my faucets, drain flanges, and hot and cold supply valves and lines  Happy Customer Russ S.

A few months ago I had Stonelike Refinishing do a home we rent.
The other tile was dull an looked like it needed a lift.
I call Dulce at Stonelike ,an from the very beginning of my call she gave me everything I needed from the instructions on how to measure to when they could do it.
I'm quite particular, so I was a little scared.
They showed up right on time.
An began doing the job in the kitchen, an three bathrooms.
I was so surprise at how they turned out I had to write this review.
They were beautiful, an made such a difference in this rental.
I would reccomend this company to anyone.
Even my company that takes care of this house wanted their phone number.
It is so affordable when you do not want to put granite in.
Also, something I really liked was if someone burns or damages the counter tops they can be repaired very easy.
