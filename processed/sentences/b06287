Birthdays, Anniversaries, Holidays.....this store always bails me out!
Why?
Because I workout at the gym next to it and I usually remember the day before the special occasion while I'm working out.....so, after a workout I'll go get the card....then I'm Mr.
Hero for not forgetting....ha!
There's nothing special about this particular store, except it's location.
Will I return?
As long as I'm married, hell ya!

I live near this Hallmark so the convenience is the only reason I frequent this location.
It is on the smaller side compared to some of the other stores but I am always able to find the card I need.
They have a rewards program so if you buy enough cards or merchandise then you you get rewarded and I do like that part a lot.
You can use your card at any location.
The 2 ladies inside don't seem very friendly so that is why I gave 4 stars.
They seem inconvenienced that you came in and seem more busy talking about their personal stuff.
All in all if you need a greeting card or stationary this location is more then likely going to have what you need.

I love Hallmark, I buy all my cards at hallmark and photo albums.
Yes, the photo albums are overpriced and I should just by all my photo albums elsewhere.
But I just LOVE hallmark.
This hallmark is clean and fresh like any other hallmark I have been, too.
The people there are friendly and always greet everyone as you enter the store.
You can find all the cards for any occasion you can think of and has a variety of selections.

It's been nearly forever since I've been in a Hallmark.
Very nice store and helpful staff but I was surprised to see a small section of the store for greeting cards and a whole lot of other stuff.
Fortunately, I was looking for "other stuff"   Found some beautiful packages of not cards although not the traditionally embossed kind I wanted but still cool.
I was kind of in a rush so didn't look around but really want a new fountain pen!
(yup, I still use them when I actually write!
