::::::       ::::::             ::::::       We looked at our entertainment book for pizza coupons and came across Domino's in some cruel twist of fate.
Since we hadn't had Domino's in easily 10 years and it was a pretty good coupon we decided in what later seemed a momentary lapse in judgement that we would use the coupon and give them a shot.
It will likely be at least 10 years before we try them again.
Pizza that was on a par with those frozen ones from the grocery store and a free sandwich we shared that left us with tummy aches.
Despite the coupon savings it's no deal for poor quality food.

Sooooooo, this is the 2nd time we ordered from this particular Dominos.
The first time we ordered, they screwed up our pizza, so when I called and spoke with the manager, she put a "free large 3 topping pizza" on the account for next time.
Ok, fine.
We call tonight to order that free pizza and we added an order of wings to that for delivery.
That was at 4:45pm...5:30 comes and goes, no pizza.
Not a huge deal considering the game was on...6:15 comes and we finally call to see what happened.
This is the conversation I had with the person on the phone when I called:  Me: Hi, we ordered a pizza at 4:45 and we were wondering what happened to our order... (gave him order/address specifics)  Dominos: Well, there is no record of your order.
Me: You're kidding, right?!
Dominos: Nope.
Me: Well, I called an hour and a half ago and the guy on the phone took the order and actually confirmed it with me.... (I got interrupted...)  Dominos: Well, I'm the manager and I've been here ALL DAY and there is no order for you.
(I'd like to add that he had the most ridiculous attitude towards me)  Me: Wow, you're the manager and you speak to customers like that?!
Dominos: Yeah.
I asked him his first and last name and I would have preferred screaming obscenities at him, but I just hung up and went to Barros which is basically 80000% better anyway.
We just wanted to use the free pizza we were "given" because they effed our order up the first time.
Shoulda learned the first time, huh?
I will NEVVVVVVVVVER go back here, and I'd suggest that anybody that appreciates to be treated the way a customer deserves to be treated doesn't either.
