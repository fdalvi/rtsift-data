I had an appointment scheduled for 11am, for which I arrived about 10 mins early.
The lady at the front desk (sandy blonde hair, black glasses) has the WORST attitude in the world.
I fill out my paperwork, turn it in to the lady, and wait.
For 1 hour 30 mins without a word spoken to me.
Finally, an assistant calls for me, takes my temperature, weighs me, and asks me how tall I am (aren't you supposed to measure that?).
He tells me to sit in this room and the doctor will be with me.
After waiting another 15 minutes, I leave my room and ask to reschedule my appt.
Attitude lady starts getting a bad attitude and even goes as far as saying "WOOSA".
She then said with great attitude and annoyance, "She just left her room, that's why you can't reschedule it!
" Waa waa waa, anything is possible.
If you can't handle the stress of your job, take a xanax or quit.
There was another lady nice enough to help me and reschedule my appt.
for the next morning.
I thanked her and left.
The only reason I had to leave my appt.
was because I borrowed my mom's car and she needed it for an interview.
Besides, who wants to stuck in a waiting room for almost 2 hours?
Not this chick.
I return the next morning, and the happier lady greets me with a smile and sets me up.
It's amazing how one positive person can change the environment of the establishment.
I met with Dr. Andriola (he's a very, very funny and honest guy), took my x-ray with another pleasant lady, and was shortly out on my way.
Walking out, I saw the she-devil.
I didn't bother to look her way.
I wanted to cross myself when I walked by.
The only reason I would recommend this place is because of Dr. Andriola and the helpful employees there.
As for the chick with glasses, you're in the wrong profession if you can't deal with people and road bumps along the way.
The Walmart down the street might be perfect for you though.

I won't go back.
Here's why.
1: Misdiagnosis: One doc I won't name couldn't figure out what was wrong with me on one occasion so she writes 2 scripts, recommends tests, and sends me on my way $120 lighter for the visit, plus $130 in script costs.
When her scripts fail to work I snap a picture of the problem and send it to a family doctor / Hospital Chief Of Staff we know in Nebraska.
She immediately diagnosed it, recommended over the counter stuff and I was healed in 72 hours.
And when I told the COS what the scripts were she laughed and said Seriously?
She gave you THAT?
You wasted your money!
2: Book a 15 min appoint to make sure you cover your issues, she rushes through and doesn't seem to really listen to you.
3: Won't renew even simple scripts for $4 meds without an expensive doctor's visit.
4: Loves to make referrals and especially to labs.
Lots and lots of lab work.
5: Front desk staff: Overworked and it shows.
In short, Las Vegas healthcare already has a bad rap.
This clinic does not help the perception problem one bit.

Even with appointment had to wait 4 hours to see the one and only doctor on site.
What a mess!

Dr. Andriola is the only reason we go here.
The wait is usually long and I notice that those without an appointment usually get seen quicker then those that do.

This review is for the sweetest nurse I've ever met, Cookie:) she's has gone above and beyond to help me everything that I've come in, which is a lot since my insurance company requires a lot of authorizations.
If you're looking for a kind and caring nurse, who always has a smile on her face, she's the one to see!
Thanks Cookie!

Not to many people waiting this time compared to last time I came here.
Even with the low # of people waiting, it still took like an hour for me to get called into the back.
I don't know if this was due to the doctor I was seeing had more patients than the rest or what, but I hate how every doctor office seems to take forever to get you seen.
Why did I schedule my appointment for 3:30 when I wasn't going to be seen until 4:30 anyways?
I could have stayed the extra hour at work, but instead im sitting in a waiting room.
Aside fromt he waiting everything else was ok.
The doctor was pretty fast with talking to me and getting me my prescriptions and sending my on my way.
I also found the staff to be mostly friendly, although one of the girls at the front seemed a little snobby towards some of the customers I seen walking in.

I only left one star because I had to.
This place is atrocious.
This is by far the most unprofessional, downright pathetic excuse for a medical office I have ever been to.
The front desk staff often seem unsure of themselves, or just don't care.
The doctors do NOT listen to you; they are more concerned with writing prescriptions and making money from the pharmaceutical companies.
One young female student doctor prescribed me incorrect medication which caused me to be hospitalized for three days.
I obviously am the one stuck with thousands of dollars in medical expenses and they wiped their hands of everything.
Wretched place, I will never, ever return and warn all people against going there.

Only left one star because I had to.
I got there at 1 I was told 2 hour wait.
By 4 pm I ask how long the wait was because I has seen 3 walk in come and go already.
I was then told I had to wait another hour.
Needles to say after another hour and a half I left without being seen.
I will never go here again would rather wait in the ER......

They do not take appointments for sick visits.
You have to do their "prompt care".
That really sucks.
They tell you about a hour wait and 3 hours later you still haven't been called back.
So basically there is a waiting room full of sick people.
Great for the well people who have appointments who are waiting.
My last visit was for a bad cough that wasn't going away.
The ladies at the front desk are super nice and friendly.
I don't know how they do it.
I couldn't handle dealing with sick, cranky people who have been waiting for hours.
One of the women brought me a cup of water because she heard me coughing.
I thought that was really nice.
When I finally got seen, I was given 3 prescriptions the most important being cough syrup.
They only do prescriptions electronically you cannot get a paper Rx.
I go to pick up my prescriptions and only 2 made it.
They have no record of the cough syrup so I call the doctors office and they say they will get it called in.
By the next day it is still not called in so I call the office again, they say it was sent the first time so I call CVS who assures me it was never received.
I call back to the office and they say they will send it over right away, by the time I get off work it still hasn't been sent so I go in person to try and get it taken care of.
They take my id and I wait for 20-30 min.
Finally they give me id back and say it has been sent to CVS and give them about a hour to fill it.
4 hours later and CVS still has not received anything.
I call the office for the last time (thankfully they are open late) pretty much begging them to please get me this cough syrup since it is the whole reason I waited for almost 4 hours the day before.
The woman I spoke to was very nice and finally got it called in for me.
Everyone I dealt with was super nice and friendly but the wait and Rx hassle is just not worth it.
