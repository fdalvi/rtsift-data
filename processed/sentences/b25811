Went here for meniscus knee surgery 2 years ago.
Even with surgery, my knee still had problems.
I had several follow up appointments to no relief.
Dr Evangelista has a horrible bedside manner.
At first I excused that thinking he was a surgical genius.
He isn't.
I went to another doc and got fixed properly.

My experience with Dr. Evangelista has been great.
I had surgery on my right knee which he performed the operation.
Not only was the surgery a success, he wanted to see me often (most of the visits post-op were free of charge) to check on my progress and tell me what I need to work on at P.T.
to get better.
Sure enough, he wants you to get back to 100%.
When talking to him, I do feel like he cares.
He just has a different way of expressing it, which is why I think the other reviewers felt like he didn't care.

This is one doctor with no bedside manner.
During one of my visits for knee problems, he left the room mid visit.
I thought he was coming back because I had some questions.
Finally a nurse walking by told me I could leave.
She eventually tracked him down to get answers for me which he conveyed only to the nurse.
Strange......

After being in a terrible accident and rushed into Scottsdale Osborn trauma unit I was lucky enough to have Dr Evangelista on-call at the time.
He was very friendly and accepting to the fact that I was not 100 years old like most of his patients.
Very good bedside manner and always answered every question I had.
He even helped me out a lot on dealing with my insurance company over some bills they sent me.
