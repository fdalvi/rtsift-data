While i didn't go to this particular store the entire strip mall was very well groomed.
This little gem is near University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale.
Peoria consists of about 4 exits but since Peoria and Glendale literally touch each other i guess that is why it has a Glendale address.
There is a nice Car wash there...this children's store...Target...Ross...Bank of America...and some decent restaurants.
It is not a must see...but is a nice 3 star strip mall.
Eat, Drink, and be Merry at Peoria Crossings my friends!!!!

Wow - I have a son so this place was sensory overload for my eyes.
But then I was thinking  - Wait I was a preteen once and if this store had been around, I know where all my allowance would have been set.
Selection is outstanding!
I recommend opting for a gift card if you are shopping for a gift  - girls can be picky!

The stores closing the entire store right now it's up to 60% off your northern.
I'm here to see what's left of this clearance sale the store is closing permanently it looks like there's still some great deals and here you might want to pop in if you have children that need a new shirt,pants, are maybe just some accessories it.
