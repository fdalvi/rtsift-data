The best taco al'carbon I have ever had!
Full of flavor!
Yum!
Must taste all of the salsas.

Hands down the best tacos in any strip mall.
Super fresh, all meat is cooked on mesquite broiler.
Delicious!
Also a condiment bar stocked with goodies.

Oh my!
I am in love!!
The hole in this strip mall where amazing Mexican food used to be has made me sad for over a year.
I'm so glad that we locals can have amazing, authentic Mexican food again!
We had carne asada burritos and tried one of each of the tacos - Fuego, Al Carbon and regular.
Deliciousness!!
The fresh guac and salsa was the icing on the cake!!
Sooo good!
Welcome to the neighborhood, Al Fuego!!
We're so glad you're here!
