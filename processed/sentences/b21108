Cruise is lovely.
Whenever my brothers are in the city I always make sure I accompany them to Cruise.
Yeah, it's a unisex shop but is aimed mainly at men, so I feel like a bit of a creep going in here alone.
The clothes they sell are ultra high-end and ultra-expensive, but they are amazing.
When I get my first proper 9-5 job, I plan to buy my power suit form here.
The husband and 2.3 children will come later, I presume.
They are a smaller version of Harvey Nichols for their brands and prices, but it's quite nice to feel posh, even if it's just for a few minutes!

Cruise is a strange one.
On the one hand, the music, minimalist decor, flyers for expensive nightclubs and perma-tanned staff lifted straight from the pages of GQ / female equivalent, bring a bit of London swishness to the streets of Scotland's more modest cities.
On the other, a sizeable proportion of their customers are still petty criminals who see spending Â£800 on a plain white vest as the ultimate expression of their masculinity.
Due to it's smaller size and subsequent sacrifice of much of the casualwear section, not to mention the presence of fewer locally based small-time criminals, this branch doesn't have quite as big a Football Factory element as it's neighbour in the sprawling metropolis down the road, but it's still there.
This shouldn't detract from the fact that the clothes often look exceptionally nice and very well made, especially some stunning suits, but it makes for a crasser, more bling bling atmosphere than I think the proprieters would like.

I've never been the biggest fan of Cruise, I'm not really one for designer labels particularly when the brand name is displayed right across the front as with most items in Cruise.
I like more low key designs and brands such as DKNY, Juicy Couture, Gucci and Fendi don't really interest me.
Like Stephanie, I prefer the guys section to the ladies as the clothes seem a bit more understated and not as "look at me, I'm wearing a designer handbag".
Most of the items in Cruise are over priced, predictable and just a bit naff but you can find the odd item that's rather nice, so I guess it's worth a look from time to time.
