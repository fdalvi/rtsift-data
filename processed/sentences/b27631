Super Dog Pet Waste Removal are life savers!
Having 3 dogs and a foster every now and then, our yard can get pretty messy.
Having Super Dog come out to clean up the yard once a week has made an enormous difference.
If I happen to be home when our tech is there, he is always friendly.
They do not mind if your pets are out when they are there, just be sure that they are not territorial or protective of your yard.
I have seen the tech sanitize his equipment as he is leaving before loading it back into his truck.
This comforts me because I know that they do this every time.
I recommend this service for anyone who loves to have a poop-free yard!

My wife says "We can hire this pooper scooper service for less than $40 per month to clean up after our 2 dogs.
"  I say "Sure - go for it but I bet they will no show within a month".
Boy was I wrong.
These guys show up every other week as scheduled.
Haven't missed a day in 8 months except for weather delays.
Both weather delays we got a phone call telling us he would come the day after.
They do a great job and yesterday I watched as they guy triple checked the gate to be sure it was closed properly.
For a very reasonable fee I am relieved of a dirty and annoying job and it is done as well or better than I did it myself.

We love the service and can't believe we didn't get it sooner.
I love the email service reminders the night before.
Also the email payment reminders are great and it takes a minute to pay them.
The service has always been dependable and affordable.
I get the joy of having two wonderful dogs without the chore cleaning up after them.
