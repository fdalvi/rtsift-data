Gas is gas!
But Chevron gas is great when combined with the people at the Pit Stop Car wash!
I love this car wash because they are fairly priced (7,9,11) depending on what you need.
But all include a free towel dry after going thru the machine.
They also offer free use of the vacuums when you are done with your rub-a-dub-dub.
So stop driving around your dirty car and get dialed in.
Maybe get some gas, too!

Great location and prices are good.

on april 28, 2013 i had gone to the carwash at pit stop on maryland parkway and windmill.
paid, drove to entrance put car in neutral and closed mirrors as instructed.
gave the attendant a tip.
proceeded through to the end of wash told by drying attendant to pull up to drying area parked opened my door to tip the attendant then checked my email.
i noticed out of the corner that the attendant was manually trying to open my driver side mirror i yelled no stop and pushed to electronically open the mirrors.
he finished drying.
i proceeded to leave the parking lot turning right onto maryland parkway.
i noticed when i turned my blinker on to turn right on to maryland my dash pinged me a note saying right turn signal mirror error, i look at the mirror and the case was just hanging on the mirror.
i pulled over and looked at it.
it was broken off completely.
i put case in my car.
i called the car wash. was told to come back to file a statement.
filed statement the attendant watched the video came back to tell me that the camera did not record the other side of vehicle.
i was told that some one would call me.
i was texted and told to go to there body shop to get a quote.
the body shop informed me that he would fax over quote to pitstop.
it had been awhile so i again contacted pit stop.
i finally had a response through text saying i can call his manager het texted me her info and said the estimate was on her desk.
i called the manager brenda 702-835-0956 left a few messages.
finally we talked and she said they were denying the claim.
i said why and explained to her again what happened.
which is we really dont know but its broken!
and it worked before i went to their car wash. she said she would get back to me.
again i wait and call her.
she tells me they are denying it because the guy dried the drivers side first then i opened the mirrors.
i again say the attendant told me the video did not record that.
i tell her again it was fine when i drove in, followed the directions and left with it broken.
also told her that i was told by some one else that they too had a broken mirror from the same car wash and the car wash had fixed it.
her reply was " if it was a forty dollar fix, there would be a solution" i was shocked and replied that because i have an expensive car you guys wont fix it.
she replied that she did not mean it that way.
i then asked for her superiors number, she told me there was no one else i said there has to be someone above you she replied the owner i said fine what is his name and number and she told me she would not give it to me.
i said are you serious im calling my insurance and better business brae she said i will show them the video.
i said ok because the attendant already told me it did not get the other side of vehicle.
she said i will have him call you and gave me his name.
after a couple days i had no call then i called left voicemail on brenda's work phone.
a few days later i received a voicemail from the owner with no return number and said he would call again.
which he never did.

Gas here was great but it was a bit cold for my liking.
This is not a tip but a review so I need to add more words.
The gas was priced well.
I was in the backseat so I don't know how easy the pump was to use.
I like the smell of gasoline.
