I lived here during 2011 -2013 this place is gorgeous and has great landscaping and pools.
I lived in a two car garage apartment and my apartment was infested with scorpions.
I reported it to the management staff on multiple occasions.
They had my apartment sprayed on a weekly basis.
One month i had 5 scorpions alone!
Finally the leasing office just said there was nothing more that they could do... scorpions make trails and my apartment just happens to be on a scorpion trail.
Office staff is not friendly.

Renting here for the first 15 months was great!
We had no problems until we tried to renew our lease for shorter than a year.
When trying to renew it is $200 more expensive to do an 8 month lease, which is what we needed.
The management recommended to sign a year lease and just pay a cancellation fee when we move, which would have cost us $1300.
We have been good tenants and paid our rent every month on time but there wasn't anything they were willing to do.
Rent from these guys if you are planning on staying for a while!
