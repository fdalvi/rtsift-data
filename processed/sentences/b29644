Horrible company!!!
They are completely unethical!!!
This company completed messed up my loan.
I sat at title for hours while the company revised my HUD SIX times.
Now, after never being late on a single payment, for no reason, I received a letter in the mail stating that they are calling my note due.
They have NOT contacted me at any time prior to this notice informing me what is wrong that would warrant them doing this.
Scary that a company can just decide to tell you that you have three weeks to pay your entire mortgage IN FULL!!

Complete incompetence.
I was given an offer on 3/4 with the word "Grant" on it.
We did our due diligence to make sure this "grant" was funded and that the buyers met the criteria.
We were assured time and time again that my buyers were qualified and their loan was ready to go.
My home was to close on 4/5.
They were aware of this and okayed that date.
We pushed it back to 4/10.
That gave them an extra 5 days to get their crap together.
We are now on 4/12 and this supposedly funded grant no longer has funding and their loan officer keeps saying he is spending "all day" working on it.
He is not giving their realtor, my realtor, or myself any answers.
He left the office before 5 today - after supposedly going over to the grant office yesterday to get some magical piece of paper.
Instead of telling me we weren't' going to close on time he allowed me to move out of my home, put down earnest money (which I will now lose) on another house, turn off my utilities, and sign myself up for an interim 50-mile each way commute plus living with family in a tiny house and four dogs!
Unethical, untrustworthy, and I have zero faith they are going to close this loan.
Also, no one ever answers the phone - main line or otherwise.
STAY AWAY.

Jeremy Lovett did an excellent job.
I was very pleased with all of the services and interactions with WJBradley.
Easy refinance experience.
