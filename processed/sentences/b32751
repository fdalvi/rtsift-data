They gave a quote and came the next day.
Very quick job with assembling a baby crib, chest, and drawer set including moving the items up to the room, assembling it, and moving the items to the desired location, and taking the trash back down to the garage.
Things to note:  They don't dispose of your garbage, they move in two-man teams usually, and they're very quick (finished assembly in about two hours).
They also came with short notice which was appreciated.
Only take check/cash as of this review date.
Price was very reasonable and definitely would use again.

Left 4 messages over 4 days, no return call, no return email.
I understand being busy however  I have to assume at this point that lack of customer service on the sales end is indicative of the quality of work performed.

This is a company that has a lack of follow-through and punctuality.
Blake, the owner, is very disrespectful and arrogant.
I'm a busy professional, and they had no respect for my time or their commitments.
I do not recommend utilizing this company.

Blake did an amazing job on my basketball hoop.
He was friendly, professional,  knowledgeable, on time and went out of his way to answer all my concerns.
Found my go to company for tough projects.
