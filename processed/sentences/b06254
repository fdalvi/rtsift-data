Funny's has been around for a long time now.
Me and the husband used to live around the corner so we'd frequent this place for gas, on his recommendation.
They always have low prices, with a catch!
The prices advertised are CASH prices, so if you're using plastic, expect to pay more!
Inside is not spotless but kept decently clean.
They serve pizza and other hot food items at a low price, good selection on fountain drinks, etc.
Your typical convenience store.
Everyone who works here has always given us great service.

There are a lot of things in the universe that are Funny.
For example, Whose Line Is It Anyway is funny.
Watching kittens jump sideways to bounce on other kittens is funny.
Guys who walk around holding up their baggy pants is funny.
A group of Penguins waddling on the ice is funny.
However, there are some things that are NOT funny.
Example, Funny's charging 13.9 cents more per gallon of Diesel gas because you don't want to pay with a wad of cash.
Poor way to compete with the stations just down the street in either direction.
THAT isn't FUNNY.

I always stop by on my way to work.
Coffee and a snack,  the only down would be the coffee isn't hot enough Staff is very friendly, prices are a little high and the bathroom could be cleaned more
