I mostly ended up grabbing breakfast from  here, so I'll leave the sandwich/lunchy fare to someone else.
I got bagels here because they were convenient.
At 4.50 they were pricey - but about on par for anything you'd get on the strip.
The coffee was actually about normal starbucks prices and delicious.
I would have liked some decaf options but I'm probably one of the only humans that isn't wanting caffeine after a long day/night.
My companions ordered breakfast sandwiches and seemed to like them ok as well.
Stop in for a quick snack, but I venture that you'll get better food elsewhere if you can actually take the time to sit down.

The food/ drink was decently priced but the service was horrible.
All i needed was a cup of coffee and waited 15 minutes to get to the counter.
The people working there are just not efficient at all.
Recommend going somewhere else!

we stopped in for a quick sandwich for lunch.
i got a cuban sandwich and my wife got a turkey sandwich.
they were about 7 or 8 bucks and are a good sized sandwich.
service was quick enough i had no issues with that.
i liked my sandwich.
all sandwiches are heated up and warm which i always enjoy.
i wouldnt make a special trip to go get the sandwich but if you're near tropicana and need a quick bite it serves that purpose.
i would get another cuban if we were around
