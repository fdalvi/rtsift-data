Eargasm Overload.
What-ta weekend!
The MMMF team really out did themselves this year!
The lineup, the seating, the food, the beer...everything was perfect.
The layout was ideal, as it provided viewers the opportunity to be close enough to see the sweat drip from the foreheads of the artists or spread out across a blanket on the grass depending on preference.
There really wasn't a bad seat in the house and the downtown location couldn't have been any better.
I'm thrilled to have such a fantastic festival right in our back yard and can't wait to see where it goes from here.
If you haven't been, definitely add it to your list.
All of your senses, along with the wonderful charities this event benefits with be mighty grateful you did.
Cheers!

Scottsdale is dumb.
McDowell Mountain Music Festival use to be in Scottsdale and by the time it was relegated to a Petsmart Parking Lot, it was time to move on.
This year the festival was held downtown at a local park and has become one of the best music festivals metro Phoenix has ever seen.
The three day festival had a different undefined theme daily and fell on spring break.
Bands like Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeroes have played the festival for years.
Check out a reasonably priced, fabulous festival worth every penny.

I liked the move to Margaret T. Hance Park.
There was a great view of the stage no matter where you were.
It was very close to a lightrail stop which is super convenient.
I was a little disappointed in the lines.
I had to wait in line to get my ID checked, wait in line for a beer and wait in line again for the bathroom.
I would say a good chunk of my time was spent standing in line.
If there are really going to be that many people there, consider more than one table for ID checks, more bathroom facilities and more vendors.
