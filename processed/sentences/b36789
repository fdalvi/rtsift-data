Quality professional hair cut by Marinella

I've been getting my hair cut here for the past year by Marinella.
I can't say enough about this place and especially Marinella.
The service has been great and I get a fantastic hair cut everytime.
Plus you can't beat the price.

Worst hair salon ever !!!!
Right when i got in i should of walked right out .
Lady who was doing my hair with the weird accent was rude from the beginning .
Ive always gone too one hairstylist so its hard for me too trust a new one , but it was the closest one too my house and had no time too go too my usual one .
But anyways right from the beginning the lady was not being professional very rude and not very professional im fine with no conversation but at least smile or something .
She didnt  know how too put on bleach or what kind too blend in with the rest of my hair .
Dumb lady left it on Toooo freaken long and basically my scalp started burning .
She kept saying its normal or whatever but ive been getting my hair bleached for 2 years so i know how it should feel .
So i asked the lady (too not call her by any other name ) too rinse my hair .
I should smacked her and sued her .
But nice of me i still payed the 80$ something dollars for some crappy as coloring .
Once my hair had dried my scalp was pealing tell me if thats wrong ?
I Would NEVER recommend this tacky place too anyone .
Save your hair ladies
