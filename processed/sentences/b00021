I really enjoy this shop.
Its definitely.
Pricey, but high quality so i feel its worth it for the bird seed maybe not the feeders.
But backyard birders should definitely check it out

Best birdseed in town.
Love their feeders but they ARE overpriced a bit.

Great selection of birdseed, birdhouses, books, and other fun wildlife-related gifts.
Yes, they may cost more than eBay, but you get great service from the staff who are helpful in answering questions.
They are knowledgable and happy to help.
