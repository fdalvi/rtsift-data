I would not recommend them for remodels.
I was very disappointed.
they fixed it but I was told they were doing me a favor by fixing it.
three months to do a 5x8 bathroom.
NO COMMUNICATION AT ALL!!!!!!!
Over priced by alot.
Even Arizona Shower Doors had comments to make about them.

Love this location, can't go 10 feet without an employee asking if I need help!
They also know what they are talking about if you have a question.

Quick and convenient, I've been given some bum advice about products and I think Home Depot is better for serious projects, so 4 stars.
Oh yeah don't waste your time with Valspar (lowes brand) paint it is beyond doubt inferior to Behr premium.
