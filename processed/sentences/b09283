This is a great company.
They are always very helpful and they always take care of your questions or any problems you have.
Great customer service, great products.
You can't go wrong with Smith Enterprise.

I could not stand the California legal Muzzle Brake that was installed on my Springfield Armory Scout M1A.
As soon as I moved out of that godforsaken state I began the hunt for a real flash suppressor.
I found it with a Smith Enterprise Vortex.
There was one problem, though...there was no front sight mounted on it as there was on the Springfield's.
I called Smith and they shipped me a gas lock as used by the USMC in Operation Enduring Freedom which is superior to the original front sight and more closely resembles the one on an H&K 91 with a hooded post.
I have been a devoted customer since then.
Shipping is fast, service is top notch and the products are made of the highest grade!
