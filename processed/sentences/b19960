This is one of these rare finds, A traditional butcher selling excellent quality meat at a very reasonable price.
Tasty chicken fillets (with no added water), lovely steak mince and pork loin.
The Steak looked very appealing and well hung, will be trying this at the weekend.
Word of warning they are Cash Only so make sure you take enough as you'll want to stock up!
