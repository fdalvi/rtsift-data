Just attended the Taco bash.
Got there two hours after opening and it was already crowded.
Most tents had hardly any room in them to just hang out, but you could find your niche if you tried hard enough.
There were lines for most things, but it wasn't a long wait for anything and that included ID check, tickets and getting a beer.
Some taco places did have rather long lines, but you could also find many that did not have those lines.
They had wrestling and some lame bands, but the crowd was mellow and friendly as we met some new friends in the drinking/tent zones.
As for tacos, I had one bad one from manuel's and two good chicken ones from familiar places in the valley, like Salty Senorita.
Half-priced admission tickets helped the cause as all drinks were 6 bucks each, but true to their word, all tacos were 2 bucks.
People were still streaming in at 4pm, so crowds are the only real issue, but today it wasn't scorching hot and you could find room to be away from crowds too if you wanted.
Pretty good festival.

i was impressed for my first visit to the taco festival.
we've had less than good experiences with local festivals recently, due in part to online coupons, so we were kind of dreading the parking, the lines, the crowds, the mis-communication, etc.
Actually...none of that happened.
since we are early birds, we arrived about noon and were whisked right through the line of cars...it moved quickly and efficiently.
then a quick walk through admissions, with no wait to buy tokens or ID check and we were eating tacos within 5 minutes of parking!
everything is token so i suggest to walk to the token tent opposite the entrance...far fewer people in line.
then just make your way through all the tasty tacos.
the longest we had to wait was for Habaneros....because they were so good we ate there twice.
what's really nice is that all the tents have what kind of tacos they are serving labeled on the outside of their tent.
it kept us from waiting in lines with only pork or beef tacos.
there were only 2 veggie taco options available, but a handful of seafood and fish options as well.
meat eaters will have every tent to pick from.
of note...Rubios has the biggest portions!
the big guys are there, El Hefe, Salty's, Dos...with their tents and plenty of drinks.
we watched some Mexican wrestling (lucho libre (sp?
)) and were lucky enough to get into the tequila tent with some friends as DD.
i didn't sample any of the tequila's but our friends seemed to be enjoying themselves immensly!
it was hot in the sun so sunscreen is highly recommended.
there are shade spots to take a break and plenty of bathrooms.
exiting was just as efficient as entering.
bring cash unless you like paying 4.50 service fees for the ATm's they have on site.

I had a Great time at the AZ Taco Festival.
I mean like Tony the f*cking Tiger Grrrrreat.
I may have just been so impressed because the most recent festival I attended was such a dud that it made this one look exponentially better.
We got here early which I think also helped.
The parking was smooth and Free.
There were no crowds to fight.
It was awesome.
The token system used to purchase food and drinks also made everything run smoother than if people were trying to pay by other means at each individual taco booth.
Very efficient.
My favorite taco was made by the Tonto Bar & Grill.
It was a grass fed bison taco with chile jicama slaw and tepary salsa.
Very good.
Monti's Steakhouse made a good beef taco, but what I liked most was their corn tusk taco basket.
That was pretty cool.
There was also a unique dessert taco made by Gertrudes.
Unfortunately I didn't take a pic...
The taco shell was a chocolate (I think) waffle cone.
Inside was avocado ice cream and something else... ugh I wish I took a pic.
Memory Fail.
It was definitely tops for uniqueness though.
I'm right there with Travis B in noticing the lack of veggie taco options.
There should have been a few more.
They're not necessarily my thing, but if I was a vegetarian, I would have been disappointed.
We didn't hang around for much of the entertainment.
It was mostly just a taco devouring expedition.
And in that respect the AZ Taco Fest was a complete success.

Best taco I had was the shrimp taco from Monti's.
Now I'm think I should have went back and tried their beef or steak taco.
The event was cool.
Parking wasn't terrible, people were nice and tacos were $2.
Entertainment was kinda lame.
There were bean bag toss and a wrestling ring.
Other than that, you can go buy drinks for $6.
Other notable tacos I ate were the duck tacos, and the avocado ice cream taco...
Which was more of a dessert than really tacos.
I wish it tasted more like avocado.
If you are into eating tacos, then this is the event for you!
Are $2 tacos cheap?
Because I didn't think so.
haha.
Maybe it's because I'm a 99 cent taco kind of guy.
Think of it this way... you pay $12 to get in, and then it's $2 tacos.
By the time you hit $20, you ate four sample size tacos.
Those are $5 sample size tacos you just ate!
But if you love tacos, eat up!

We had a wonderful time at the taco festival.
We got there around 3 and it we were swept right in.
No lines and parking was easy.
The organizers of the festival were very organized because getting in was so quick.
My favorite tacos were the sausage tacos from the French Cowboy.
I need to find that shop because I can't get them off of my mind.
My only complaint is I wish there were more vendors that had drinks and tacos.
I would like to not have to walk around looking for drinks.
But overall and excellent and super fun Saturday.

This was my 2nd year coming to the AZ Taco Festival @ Salt River Field....and it was awesome!
Here are some great Tacos I sampled:  Gadzook's http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arizona-taco-festival-scottsdale-2?select=yMLXtQHcNh4Y1dUGlu1Qsg#yMLXtQHcNh4Y1dUGlu1Qsg  Tonto's http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arizona-taco-festival-scottsdale-2?select=U6UEfxYYHJu1sBlQwjrdHQ#U6UEfxYYHJu1sBlQwjrdHQ  Bootleggers http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arizona-taco-festival-scottsdale-2?select=3tKf9HgfPKQfa-lkD9ehDQ#3tKf9HgfPKQfa-lkD9ehDQ  Lola's http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arizona-taco-festival-scottsdale-2?select=axptXcWvf6voPHKZry0xCQ#axptXcWvf6voPHKZry0xCQ  Distrito's http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arizona-taco-festival-scottsdale-2?select=StfqxBvHQl-szN-B2uCecg#StfqxBvHQl-szN-B2uCecg http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arizona-taco-festival-scottsdale-2?select=thMPxtHOMY6ZVkNmbkb8qg#thMPxtHOMY6ZVkNmbkb8qg  Pirate Tacos http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arizona-taco-festival-scottsdale-2?select=B0Y6S_CNQf9aqr5Bt3Nz8A#B0Y6S_CNQf9aqr5Bt3Nz8A  Habanero Tacos http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arizona-taco-festival-scottsdale-2?select=zC00w76RV4x6oCeZsaG3sw#zC00w76RV4x6oCeZsaG3sw  Queso Good Taco http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arizona-taco-festival-scottsdale-2?select=zCZoKUpL5Z4xOPRVlO9oJw#zCZoKUpL5Z4xOPRVlO9oJw  Tacos Huicho (Pork Taco) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arizona-taco-festival-scottsdale-2?select=ezPMUs_cTk9Br43avkkaYg#ezPMUs_cTk9Br43avkkaYg http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arizona-taco-festival-scottsdale-2?select=9ZSHxn7qI7MF17PSb-P2Hg#9ZSHxn7qI7MF17PSb-P2Hg  El Palacio Taco http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arizona-taco-festival-scottsdale-2?select=TARUQ1_U1aaTETgbhcBsVg#TARUQ1_U1aaTETgbhcBsVg  Four Seasons Steak Taco http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arizona-taco-festival-scottsdale-2?select=REUv95P5KMpK9uYkkr1M1A#REUv95P5KMpK9uYkkr1M1A  Fuzzy Taco Shop http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arizona-taco-festival-scottsdale-2?select=s28LhTWzTs3QaokQoFmipA#s28LhTWzTs3QaokQoFmipA  Besides the great Tacos, El Jefe & Sandbar had a bar/lounge setup where DJ's were playing music and people were dancing & hanging out.
Sandbar had a cool TV setup so we could watch football.
There was also a Lucha Libre wrestling ring setup and they'd have wrestling matches throughout the day.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arizona-taco-festival-scottsdale-2?select=DIefhjiBRP1pj0PgyiBD1Q#DIefhjiBRP1pj0PgyiBD1Q  On Sunday, Yelp hosted a Chihuahua fashion contest.
It was pretty cool, but the stage was so short and the crowd was large so it was hard to see from the back of the crowd.

Parking was easy and FREE!
I can't wait to come back next year!
Return Factor - 100%

I thought this year was better than the Fest last year.
It was more organized.
We went as soon as it opened at 11a on Sunday.
We found parking immediately and we had prepaid discount tickets $6 a piece.
Once you are inside you can purchase "tokens" for $2 per piece.
Almost all tacos were a token so $2 a taco.
There were a few tacos that required 3 tokens and those were specialty ones like the crab avocado at The Monk.
Margaritas and beer were $6.
We ended up spending a total of $38.
We especially liked the tacos from Distrito, Pirate Taco, and the ahi tuna tacos at Ling and Louie's.
I like the taco festival because it's something fun to do outside in the sunshine with live music and great people watching.
I did notice a lot of families, including ourselves.
I would rate it as a good event to bring you kids to and have a good time while sampling the best tacos.

This was a fun event, but not a great value.
My husband and I were gifted free tickets to this event, and attended on Sunday, parking was easy and free.
The lines were not too long to get ID'ed and to purchase tokens.
Tokens cost $2 per token and it was 2 tokens for 1 taco and 3 tokens for alcohol (margarita/wine/beer).
Some tacos were better than others.
My favorite was the goat taco from Gertrudes and the carne asada taco from the Four Seasons.
The tacos varied in size, from a mid-sized tortilla to a mini tortilla, as well as various fillings where some places were more generous than others.
It seems that the stand that had the largest tacos won the contest, we didn't try those though.
Los Primos Carniceria were serving authentic street tacos which were fantastic, but they handed us flyers advertising for their business which offers $1 tacos, we were paying $2 for the tacos there, so we felt a little ripped off.
All together we spent $40 for 3 margaritas, 1 beer, and 8 small tacos, plus if we were to purchase two tickets at $24, it totals out to be $64, not worth the price in my opinion.
On a positive note, this one of the few opportunities to try so many different types of tacos in one place, and we discovered some new restaurants.

It was really fun and had great tacos!
Every taco I ate became my favorite one and I couldn't really choose from all of them.
The couple that did stand out were a pork belly taco and this other pork taco where the restaurant was giving generous amounts of guac and salsa on the side.
It was a great event that I would go to again if I am in town :)

Taco Fest was alright.
Probably wouldn't attend again, only because it was seriously over priced and their "voting" was laughable.
All the taco's were delish!
The music was fun and the location was cool.
The price for admission was $12 per person, all that got you was in the gate, a little obnoxious!
It is cheaper to get into the fair and I am risking life and limb when I go there.
They should cut the price in half; maybe $6 to get in and tacos should be no more than $1 (they were $2).
The point was to try as many as you could and choose which is the best right?
I need to be able to try more than 3 or 4 to make an accurate and informed choice.
I gave the admin people all my money so I couldn't get all the taco's I wanted.
The biggest flaw... the voting process.
Yes, we are in a tech area, BUT not everyone has joined in just yet.
Not everyone has a smart phone, and not everyone that does will take the time to down load a random ap they will never use again to vote on some stupid taco.
I had a smart phone, and would download a new ap just cuz, and I did.... but finally gave up when it took me 15 minutes and still wasn't able to figure the damn thing out.
Epic fail on their part for not making the process more user friendly.
Now the good parts....
I went out on a limb and was adventurous that day.
I tired Buffalo, Ahi, Tilapia, Shredded Beef and Goat.
All were great in their own way.
The toppings on the Buffalo taco were the best, yummy crème sauce and pickled onions!
The flavor of the Goat meat was by far my favorite, thank you Gertrude's of DBG!
Monti's shredded beef was perfectly cooked.
Ling & Louis had a yummy cold Ahi taco, could have been a bit bigger though.
And Rubio's had a blackened tilapia taco that was super yummy I wanted another!
I doubt I will go back, but it was fun eating a bunch of tacos with my fam and fiancé!
:-)

Taco Festival: I salute you!
Wow, this was my first time at a Taco Festival, I'm not sure if this thing happen all the time in the South West but it sure as $#!& doesn't happen in Canada!
I had a blast.
There we're so many amazing AZ  restaurants out representing as well as food trucks and super cool other places like Snoh.
There were VIP tequila and beer tents, fabulous weather, well organized parking and super great event staff.
A major shout out to Mission/House, the most amazing, creative tacos ever!
We went back for seconds - and the infused whiskey tea that Chef Louis created.
I also have to give it to El Heffe, they most definitely know how to create a party!
For photo ops, the full sized wrestling ring with Mexican luchador, ya, that was unreal!
The whole day was full of fun, tacos, tequila and new friends.
As soon as tickets go on sale for next year Arizona, buy them!
And get the VIP ones, arriving and not having to pay for everything because it's all included in your VIP price is the best!

Excellent tacos, decent price.
Fun way to kill a few hours and eat some amazing variations upon the classic taco.
