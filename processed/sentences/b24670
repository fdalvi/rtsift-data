Holy cow.
Talk about needing to increase staffing.
So I walk in and there's two people in the waiting room, this should go quick right ?
Well I get told there is an hour wait.
Well I'm already here, might as well wait.
Hour goes by and were through both people in front of me and I continue just to sit there.
They don't do appointments.
So this is really the only choice.
I would go elsewhere in the future.
Extra star is because it is a nice area that is kept clean.
The staff did acknowledge the longer wait time and apologized, which means a lot to me.

We have been waiting 70 minutes for a simple chest X-ray.
None of the staff seams bothered that patients are upset with the long wait.
Finally, and procedure took all of 1 minute.
I would not recommend this place.

people here are not friendly and long time waiting.... also charged me wrong amounts....
