I like the complex it's very quit and calm.
I should really be giving this place 1 star though because their maintenance is horrible I've been here for 6 months and have had a problem with a leak that wets my carpet and smells really bad.
Every time I speak with the manager she says it's been fixed yet it rains again and I find myself with the same problem.
I've expressed to her my concerns about the leak, holes in doors, non working closet doors, and it has not been fixed.
I think waiting 6 months for repairs is ridiculous.
They should really replace the manager and get someone else.

Only one pool that's always dirty.
No fitness area.
Crappy maintenance and upkeep of the apartments.
Can't wait to move out!
