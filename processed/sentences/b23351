I like this place!
Every time Ive been in any of these stores the products has been of high quality and the prices are ok for this type of store.
I have never been disapointed with their products after purchase.

I walked in with very high hopes and walked out very disappointed.
It really reminded me of one of those weird grocery stores in London where all the food is pre-packaged and icky.
All I really wanted was a head of lettuce and some nice produce.
I walked out with nothing.
EVERYTHING is packaged.
I had know idea!!
This place is anything but Fresh.
Easy yes....fresh no.
I will stick to Trader Joe's.
