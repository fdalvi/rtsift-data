Great coffee, quick service, attractive if slightly sterile environment.
Needs to be busier.

Awesome local business.
Great services with a variety of drinks and deserts.
Family run and very clean.
Free WiFi!

This place is a wonderful break from the chain coffee shops.
They offer a great selection of coffees, gelatos and baked goodies.
I loved the coconut bread.
The atmosphere is so relaxing I really think I could of fell asleep in there.
The owners are super friendly and the shop is also kid friendly once a month they have this guy called super dave come out and play music for the kids.
