What a great time we had at polar snow las vegas!
We had orange with sweet cream and ice cream!
My friend said he had the best tigersblood ever!
We will be back, they give you a buy one get one free  card every other time!
Craziness!
I can get whatever size i want!

The dreamsicle shaved ice is delicious and it comes with Thrifty ice cream in the middle.
I love that they give out buy one get ones (bOGoS) and the prices are great for the value.
Thanks Polar Snow for keeping the summers cool!

i have never been so poorly treated in all of my interactions with vendors such as these.
and lets be honest, the craft of snow cone making is not hard to perfect, so what else is there besides customer service?
by far the rudest, most arrogant man i have ever met.
i promise this is not senseless bashing, and i also promise that this review is not unjustified.
our experience here was that bad.
whoever the guy with the beard is needs to be very careful he does not treat others as poorly as he treated me.
i took the wrong snow cone after it was handed to me by one of the guys working in the trailer, and he freaked that he had to make another one.
he was so condescending, asking me how i didn't realize i had the wrong one.
you handed it to me!!
he lost his temper, threw the old snow cone in the trash, and basically threw a fit like my 4 year old does when he doesn't get his way.
there are much better people out there who deserve your business more than these people.
