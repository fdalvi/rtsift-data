Just picked up my Tahoe after dropping it off to get detailed.
I was amazed when I picked it up.
When I dropped it off it had about a years worth of food and drink that my two kids have dropped or spilled since the last detail.
I couldn't believe how clean these guys got the carpet.
The entire vehicle looked almost as if it were brand new and its 6 years old.
I highly recommend these guys and will definitely be going back.
They exceeded my expectations.

Good enough, except I can't stand anywhere that allows the windshield repair vultures to operate there.
It feels like when I refuse the windshield repair the car wash is subpar.
Make sure to print off the coupons from the website, you can save alot.

They always do such a good job in washing my car, inside an out, but I just hate the windshield nazi's.
I know I have a chip in my windshield, I dont need for you to point that out to me.
I just come in to get my car washed, not be interigated about the windshield!

Good car wash, they do a good job.
The prices are a little high, but they usually have a groupon deal every now and again.
Like other reviews, the windshield guys are bothersome.

Prices are high.
But still decided to get my brand new truck washed here.
Sat in the waiting room.
After watching numerous cars and trucks go by.
After 30 I thought maybe they are just doing a good job.
An hour goes by.
Finally start asking about my truck.
I go look outside it's still out front and nobody has even touched it.
Very upset because I was hoping to have it cleaned for my son's graduation.
I didn't have any more time to waste with these jokers that wanted to act tough after I confronted them about it.
No apologies just gave me a refund.
This place needs better management.

Watch out for the short black dude in the white shirt ladies.
Too big of a flirt!
Teeters on the edge of uncomfortable and scary!

Take way to long to clean my car.
2 hrs and they still haven't wax or clean the inside.
And they pushy when all I wanted was a wash and inside detailed

Horrible service!
After paying $80 for an interior detail & exterior wax, I dropped my car off at 8:30am.
Johnny, a persistent, rude sales rep asked me 4 times if I wanted to add $40 to have it buffered.
Johnny told me the detail and wax would take 2-4 hours.
At 4pm, I arrived to find my car was not done and would not be until 5:30pm.
Asking to speak with a manager, I was introduced to Jonathan.
He was also rude, unapologetic and offered no customer service.
Needing to be somewhere by 5pm I had to take my car only 1/4 done.
I asked for a refund and was told no because they would finish if I stayed.
Both at the time of paying & pick up I had to wait in line due to other upset customers complaining about service to the counter clerk Ashley and the manager Jonathan.
