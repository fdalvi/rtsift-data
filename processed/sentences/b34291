It has been 18 months since I saw Dr. Sparer and have  neglected going for a routine exam.
My knees began hurting  a few months ago and recently my shoulder began to hurt.
When my shoulder hurt so badly that I couldn't drive I thought it was time to make an appointment!
I saw Dr. Sparer on Sunday evening and Monday morning for treatment for my knees and shoulder.
By Thursday I was pain free and didn't need an adjustment!
I highly recommend him for his non force technique!

It has been ten days since my adjustment and I have been working out during this time.
My adjustment is still holding!
Yeah to Dr. Harlan Sparer, nonforce chiropractic really is amazing.
After thirty three years and ten different chiropractors I am amazed at this type of adjusting and wonder why it does not have more press?
I would highly recommend Dr. Harlan and nonforce chiropractic!
