Very friendly environment.
They take walk-ins as well as making appointments.
They do hair and wax hair removal.
They even do pedicures.
I went in for a eyebrow wax and a hair trim.
Mary did a great eyebrow wax.
When I asked for a trim she trimmed up my layers very nicely so they were more prominent.
They do charge extra for a shampoo but a shampoo and a hair cut is the only way to go.

Mary is my favorite.
However their are several options so you can find your best fit.
I get my kids cuts there too.
Not the best for kids but they do a good job.
I suggest every tries them.
Their pricing is responsible and the owner is very down to earth and workable.

I have been to several Salons both in the East and West Valley and I'm extremely happy I found this place.
My stylist is Angie.
She is super friendly and did an amazing job on my hair.
I showed her a picture of the Color Highlights I wanted and she did just that with an awesome twist to it.
She made it look even more amazing than I could've imagine.
Thank you Angie for doing a great job!

I did not get a bad cut; however, I did not get what I asked for.
I have a sever a-line bob.
I asked for Young to keep the same shape just trim about 1/4 inch off the length.
She took it upon herself to add layers where there were none, and took off about a full inch of length.
When I noticed the long chunk fall to my lap, I asked why she was trimming more than the previously discussed amount.
Her comment was "Oh you didnt want me to add layers?
" My response was, "why would you add some where there were none to start with?
" She replied "I should have I asked, Im sorry.
Do you want me to add them to the other side that I have not cut?
" to which I responded "Well they have to match...." Like I stated at the start, had I asked for her to take off an inch and turn my sleek drastic A-Line into a short choppy pixi, I got a good cut.
