Saw a guy smoking in the car while delivering pizza in my neighborhood.
Called and spoke to a manager, who says this is ok and that ALL delivery drivers are allowed to smoke.
I respect the fact that people have the right to smoke, just not in a car while delivering food..GROSS!

For take out pizza it was not bad!!
Have so many to choose from have Never tried papa johns before!
So took a chance,it was hot and came with extras!
Will I order again maybe but am going to try others since I'm new to this area!

Today, Papa's was offering a large cheese pizza (with up to 8 additional toppings for free) to acknowledge the Arizona Cardinals 4 touch downs and win in yesterdays game.
What a great deal!!
We placed an order on-line several hours ahead of time for a 5:30 pick up at this store.
I arrive to get the pie and it did look wonderful as they always do, however my request for a square cut was not done.
The cashier graciously asked if I wanted to have another pizza pie made but I declined as there was not enough time in my evening schedule.
When it arrived a the house, it was still hot and everyone enjoyed it as always.
They really do make one of the better pizza's, two very enthusiastic thumbs-up for the taste and value ratings.
My overall rating for this store is only 3 stars as their on-line system has made mistakes in the past and this was no exception.
It has already been addressed with the corporate offices and I am certain it will be addressed and corrected.
Bottom line:  Great Pizza...great price, locations everywhere.
Take advantage of their specials as they cannot be beat!!
Be cautious of the on-line ordering.
ENJOY!
