I was up north in the Cave Creek area on business yesterday and stopped by this Hot Dog stand.
What a wonderful surprise!
The Hot Dog Guy, Jerry Vicena is indeed from Chicagoland and has a good understanding on how to make and serve a tasty dog.
But, he's not just a one trick pony with his Chicago Red Hots.
He also serves a Coney Island dog, a Polish, a East Coaster, etc.
All were very good from what the folks around me said, as we sat and ate while enjoying the cool sunny day up north.
I would definitely, definitely come back or make a special trip to this Hot Dog Guy!
Nice job, Jerry!
You do Chi-caw-go proud!

Stopped by Hot Dog Guy after a hike today.
He was located on Cave Creek Road in front of El Encanto's market.
I had a Chicago Dog and hubby had a Wild West Wiener.
The bill was less than $10 and the dogs were tasty.
He uses Vienna Beef dogs and nice, fluffy poppy seed buns from Basha's.
The Chicago Dog had lots of tomatoes, a pickle spear and some good sport peppers.
The Wild West Wiener had BBQ sauce, bacon, and Frito's corn chips.
I will definitely stop by again for fast, cheap, good food!

Oh, how I have missed Chicago Dogs since moving here.
They were good, although one of my buns had a hard bottom.
He claims he bakes them fresh everyday.
The celery salt really made the dog and most of my buns were moist.
I did miss having fresh cut fries...not quite Gene and Judes...but close.

Great place for a dog!
We live in Indiana and go see him when we are in Scottsdale.
Nice to keep locals in business!

Great hot dogs, great service, and he even takes debit if you're out of cash!

Hey - All the local construction guys eat here - so you he has good quality stuff at low prices.
Nice assortment of different Hot dogs.

I was really craving a Chicago dog knew just the place to go have never been disappointed had 2 of them

Being from Chicago, I know a good hot dog.
When a friend from New York who lived in Cave Creek told us about the "Hot Dog Guy" and that he serves top-notch NY- and Chicago-style dogs, we knew we had to go.
Finding out that Jerry is a fellow Chicagoan and knows how a dog should taste was quite a happy feeling.
The Coney was phenomenal.
At the risk of sounding blasphemous--the Polish was better than Portillos'.
No fooling.
AND the best part is--you get $1 off your 2nd dog!
So, of course, we got another Polish.
Very pleasant ambiance and quick service--closed my eyes and felt like I was "home" again.
Chicagoans or New Yorkers--please stop by and give him your business.
And anybody else who appreciates a great hot dog--for that matter!!!!
