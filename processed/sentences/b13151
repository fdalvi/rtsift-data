This store has great customer service and has a lot of their jewelry pieces!
Theres a little elderly Japanese woman who works there and she is great!
(I forgot her name)... will be stopping by that store soon though... it's Movado, how can you not!
EDIT: (5/23/07) today i went to the costa mesa store and ran into one of the associates for the las vegas store who informed me that the japanese woman is no longer working there *SNIFFLE SNIFFLE* BUT the associate i did talk to today (MICHELLE NISSAN)... she's helpful, friendly, easy going..... and even though theres a movado here in costa mesa, i think i will continue to visit the las vegas store =)  ============ EDIT: 2/2008 so the associate michelle nissan is the BOMB.
i kept receiving notes from FEDEX saying i had a package and it required a signature.
well it turns out michelle sent me a package for the latest catalogs!
thanks girlie!
i haven't had much time to get to the store, so this was so helpful..... =)

This is a must stop for me when I am in Vegas.
This store is so much larger than ours in CO.
The staff is always friendly, and it seems I can't walk in without getting something!
I love their jewelry!
It is hard to find.
Can't even get it on the internet.

I was looking for a new watch... but honestly, and more importantly, I was looking for a deal.
After some negotiating, we came to an agreement... and they even suggested I have the watch shipped (on their dime, of course) to me in AZ so I could avoid paying NV sales tax.
Overall, I felt very good about the price I paid for the timepiece and the experience.
