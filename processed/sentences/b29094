I woke up with another hangover this morning (it is the festival after all).
One of those rotten, throbbing hangovers.
A 'thick head' I like to call it.
The kind where all you want to do is eat something hearty and unhealthy.
So I took a wander into Morningside.
No I don't want a brie and cranberry bagel.
Neither do I want a pan au chocolat and a latte.
And I absolutely do not want parmesan and rocket foccacia drizzled with extra virgin olive oil.
I want a fry up.
A massive greasy fry up.
And then I found the Yellow Caf√©.
Now it would be completely unfair to describe this place as a greasy spoon.
It absolutely is not.
It's much more refined than that.
What it is, though, is an unpretentious, family-run local cafe, selling simple, home-made food.
They put a Mediterranean twist on things, but that's OK because they do it well.
My breakfast was great.
Good music too.
Back to bed now.
