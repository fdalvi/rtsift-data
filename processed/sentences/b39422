Wow!
Probably the worst experience ever!
We called first and said we are snowboarding on Sunday and asked if they offer travel day before and after.
And the girl said yes.
I told her I was leaving early sat morning and if I could come down Friday end of day?
She said no problem.
So we drove all the way down from paradise valley to the store.
Got fitted.
And was told it's now $50.
I told the guy what I was told on the phone and he tells me no we don't do that.
He went and talked to the owner and he confirmed the same thing.
They said sorry but she is NEW and doesn't know any better.
And that they would not honor it after driving all the way down.
While I was telling the employee why that is very unprofessional the owner just sat there one table over and did not step up once or say anything to help the situation.
Very useless and unprofessional.
I would not recommend these clowns to anyone.
Useless liars.
It was much better before this idiot took it over.

Super helpful!
Their prices are lower than any I was able to come across in the east valley.
Prices were great, but the service and what they offer was even better.
Got what I needed quickly, and without a hassle.
I would use them for sure another time!

Totally professional and reputable local business.
I've rented gear, purchased equipment and clothing, and even traveled on one of their bus ski trip packages, and I have always remained a very satisfied customer.
The staff goes out of their way to offer help and answer questions, but not where it's annoying.
The gear for purchase is about average priced for what you'd spend in most places, but the rentals have always come out less expensive than what you would expect.
They even have car rooftop cargo units to rent.
I'll always be a loyal customer to these guys and will continue to recommend them.
