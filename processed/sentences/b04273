Very helpful!
The abortion went splendidly.
Much better than the cost hanger method.
I look forward to using their services for any future procedures.

Please don't murder your baby.
Their precious life is in your hands, mommy.

Do not come here!
This place is packed full of people waiting to have an abortion and it's really gross.
They don't take time to explain anything and they will not even let your boyfriend or husband in the ultrasound room if you want him there.
You can definitely find help somewhere else where you are not treated like cattle!

I wanted to delete my review because my profile had been compromised and I did not write that.
I think they provide mediocre service at best and the overall cleanliness of the place was questionable.
I know pregnant women puke, but c'mon can you at least clean the bathroom.
