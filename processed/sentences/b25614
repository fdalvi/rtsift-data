Everything I need for an improptu Carne Asada party - carne, pollo, tortillas and delicious guacamole!
Throw in some Bimbo pastries and Coke and I feel like I am in San Carlos!

Excellent carniceria in Peoria.
I agree with other reviews, this is the most northern carniceria to where I live and I love it.
Been here about 6 times ordering the carne asada and have never had a bad experience.
Every time I cook the carne I get compliments and questions where I buy it.
Great place!

Best carniceria in peoria.
You cant beat the price for a full tray of cooked carne asada meat.
Love going here and buying lunch for work for everyone.
Insde theres lots of cooked and uncooked meat to chose from
