This is a restaurant inside of the Fiesta Resort Conference Center.
It deserves it's own entry here on yelp.
Now we didn't get to have the complete restaurant experience here due to it being late, and our only reason for being here is a flight missed connection.
I have to give 2 thumbs up for the service in the lounge area with a smiling face by Jenn the waitress.
She had to work late with the rush of hungry travelers, but she didn't seem to mind.
I had a soup and salad.
On the menu it said "Chef's Famous Chicken Tortilla Soup.
" I had to try it and wow...it's the best I've ever had anywhere.
So, here in our situation tired, hungry, and stuck...I discovered the best Tortilla soup ever.
I wish I had the recipe.
If anyone ever gets graced with it, please let me know.
Delicious!

I'm assuming this is pretty standard for a hotel restaurant to not be amazing, but this one was mediocre at best.
Underwhelming service, unimpressive food, small menu and pretty pricey at that.
I'd say take the shuttle to a different restaurant in town.

20 mins for tea, the place was not even busy bad service good food!

I am staying at the hotel and I've been eating the spinach salad since I'm on a healthy diet.
It seems its the only thing I can eat but the burger, fish and chips was enjoyed by my boyfriend very much.
The staff is super sweet and very nice.
