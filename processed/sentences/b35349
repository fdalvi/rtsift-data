The pizza is amazing.
I love the deep dish stuff.
Don't ever tell me how many calories - but the stuff is amazing.
Tried their salads and those were good too.
Typically, I say that most restaurants do one thing really well - however, they do many.

The double-decker Chicago-style pizza is a winner!
The sauce is fabulous and it's cooked beautifully.
Well done!

We decided stop in to have a slice or two.
The dining / waiting area was completely filthy.
The floor was covered with a variety of dead bugs and garbage and the two small tables were sticky.
I like their food at their other restaurants but will never go back to the Monona location.
