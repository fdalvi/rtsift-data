no appointment needed walk in and you will get treated asap!
I've had to get blood work done several occasions for physicals and what not and I will always choose Sonora Quest Laboratories.
Professional, quick and pain free.
I had 12 viles drawn once for all types of test and  they were done quickly, painless and even had a nice chat with the professional drawing blood.
Always choose Sonora Quest they are the best!
