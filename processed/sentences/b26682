I've been here quite a few times this month for Februany, aka $5 footlongs for anything except premium subs.
Since it's the closest spot to my home, I think it's about time they got a review.
The service is consistently fast, and the food is just fine.
I've also had no problems redeeming my survey code for a free cookie (if you don't know what that is, check the back of your receipt next time).
Preparation seems pretty consistent except for one occasion where they might have skimped a bit on my chipotle mayo.
It's kinda small, but aren't they all?
Only things stopping this from being a 5 star are that it's a fast food chain restaurant and that the white guy (haven't caught his name) constantly tries to upsell.
He asks if you want more cheese and whatnot, and it gets annoying.
Note to self: keep getting my sub toasted because it seems that it's $5.41 for both toasted and untoasted.

Long story short got a tuna sub it had other foods in the tuna ....I almost puked it was a strip of backon inside my tuna.
The manager was nice but the store is unclean.
They just slop things together so their are tons of food inside other foods.
The bread is hard it dont matter what kind of bread you choose.
But who cares if the employees are nice.
Im buying food and I dont like they unsafe unclean habbits.
I wish the health dept would pop up out the blu and regrade them.
I bet they would get a F+

Employees were very fast and friendly, place was nice and clean as well.
Will definitely return!
Location is on a busy corner.
