I really like this company and here's why:  -Punctual, presentable and professional technician -Staff took the time to explain what was wrong with the unit and why -Fast service - Was recommended to us by word of mouth (to me, the best form of advertising) -Reasonable rates

Family business, great customer service, reliable, honest, fast, friendly.

Great service at a great price.
Would recommend these guys to anyone!

Initially I was very impressed with this company.
They were able to get a friendly tech out the same day I had issues with my AC unit.
The tech seemed knowledgeable and was able to complete the repair in a timely fashion.
I was even considering referring this company to my family and friends.
That was until 3 days later when my AC unit went out again.
The unit was displaying the exact same symptoms as before I paid them for the repair.
When I called the technician and let him know that the issue hadn't been resolved, I was told I'd be liable for another service charge if I wanted to get this addressed.
To make matters worse, it was at the emergency on-call rate which is almost twice their normal price.
From a service standpoint this is a very poor business practice.
Why do you charge the customer again when you failed to solve their problem the first time they paid you?
Sadly, I cannot recommend this company to anyone.
