Poor customer service.
Told me to go to another dunkins for what I wanted.
I drove here from Laveen!

This place was neither bad nor great.
It was just ok.  Staffed with one person in the middle of the day.
The guy behind the counter was a little bit slow.
But, for a location in a gas station, I didn't expect much.
I'd hope they have someone better working the morning rush.
The donuts are still the best.
I can't stand Krispy Kream.
