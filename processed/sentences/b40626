My friend set up a girls night for eight of us to do wall yoga.
It was an hour long and was very peaceful and relaxing.
The stretching poses were great and left feeling rejuvenated.
Looking into a group date night in near future.

Wonderful yoga studio.
I have had 2 of the instructors so far and they are both wonderful.

This studio is professional, helpful, clean & taught by the best.
There is no pressure at this studio!
First timers are more than welcome!
Many of the teachers do what ever they can to help you and make sure your comfortable.
Chona has a great thing going here!
Try out a class and see for yourself!
