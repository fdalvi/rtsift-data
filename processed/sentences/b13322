This is no longer a Long John Silvers.

Well, it's cheap fast food fish.
I've given it a few tries, and really just not worth it even for cheap and fast.
Half of the fish they give you has been sitting in oil and is soggy-oily on the bottom.
Fries are meh.
The hush puppies are really good if done just right, but that's only about 50% of the time.
I doubt I will be back.

I love their thick, crispy fish, chicken, fries and hush puppies!
Their new fish ciabatta sandwich is now my all time favorite - I won't get a fish sammy from any other fast food restaurant now.
