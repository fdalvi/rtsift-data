The facility is very new and nice.
Some of the staff are exceptional and some are what you'd expect to find at the VA...
The guy who did the blood draw on me was super friendly, did an awesome job, and was very professional.

What can I say...the place, staff and doctors are great.
I hate to go to the dr to begin with, and the VA has made some serious changes in their level of patient care over the years.
This facility is just an example of the steps in the right direction.
