Regardless if it's busy or not, this staff is extremely helpful, and down to earth.
First time at this Outlet and the prices are good and way better then some of the actual name brand stores.
Thanks!

Was just there, the selection is great.
I like that althought they are in an outlet mall they have the current styles available.
Many stores at the outlet centers carry OLD merchandise, not Robert Wayne.
Staff was helpful and friendly.
They have a great Selection of UGG's.
Prices are good as well.

bought shoes and then exchanged them for diff ones.
pro tip:  clean them before you exchange them.
it'll save you a lot of hassle.
