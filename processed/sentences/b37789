I lived in Riverview Park Apartments for just over 2 years with a good friend of mine.
When we first moved in to the community, we loved the landlords, space, location and overall apartment.
It was a quiet community and we loved how close it was to a lot of attractions.
However, after those landlords left (which was about a year later), I truly felt the complex went for a nosedive.
I noticed the tenants coming in were trouble.
I firmly believe our neighbors were drug dealers and on one Saturday night, someone tried to steal stuff off our patio!
The cops were called and I informed management but they really did nothing to alleviate my concerns.
I didn't feel safe living there and tried to be home as minimal as possible.
Maintenance was also a problem, there's only 1 guy for the entire complex.
I had to make many reminder phone calls to management for repairs needed and it took weeks for stuff to get done.
Management at that point was very unpredictable and kept trying to increase the price of our rent.
At that point, we had enough and decided it was time to go.
After we moved out, we hassled with (again) new management to get out deposit back in full.
We eventually did but was a frustrating process overall.

We have been living here for a few months now and have been very happy.
At first glance from the outside this place is nothing to look at, but inside has everything you need!
Jen the property manager is AMAZING!
She has been so helpful with anything we have needed.
As a travel nurse I have lived in several apartments and for the location, space and price, this place really can't be beat!

My family has lived here for 2 years and we like it.
The property manager is great!
Maintenance is done quickly and we are right across from the beautiful Riverview Park!
At first glance it may not seem like much but the inside of these units is beautiful.
All tile floors are a plus especially if you have small kids or pets.
