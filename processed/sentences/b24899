This is the McDonald's located just inside the newly remodeled Wal-Mart on 59th ave. & Bell.
Review is for breakfast experiences only.
Service was prompt and polite, and I didn't have to explain over and over that I wanted no bacon, or have a cashier that could not figure out how to order an "egg and cheese biscuit".
Food came up fast, tasted the usual McDonald's way, and then I was off to fight the other Wal-Mart patrons (at least the lady in front of me extinguished her mini-cigar before going into Wal-mart).

Let me start by saying I am not one to complain because I've worked in fast food before but this is ridiculous..
Hate this McDonalds.
Staff is rude.
And service is horrible.
I went through the drive thru getting my Neice and nephew food after school and I paid the guy in cash and some change and was a dollar short so I have him my card and I got my food and got home then I got home checking my bank account to see that I got charged for the whole meal on my card and then my niece told me her sandwich wasn't there..
So I got angry not only double charged but didn't get the food.
So I went back and told the manager RION (that's his name) what happened and I was friendly at first but after waiting 15 minutes for him to count the register money to see if they were over tells me they are only 8 dollars over and I could take that or nothing..
I told him I was charged 12 extra on my card after already paying in cash.
And I asked for the guy who was helping me before to come up to clear the confusion and the fucking manager tells me that he's working and they would slow business down if they brought him up.
First of all, the business already sucks!!
If he's charging everyone double and not giving the right food.
So if you must go to McDonald's then go to any other one but this.. Horrible horrible horrible people there.

Quite Breakfast.
Come in morning, fast and good.
