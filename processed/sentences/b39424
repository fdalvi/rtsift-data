Went in for an oil change I was in and out in no time.
Mike did a 27 point inspection and let me know what was going on with the car he was quick and great I'll be back!

These guys are the real deal.
They take good care of me and my family.
I took several cars to get maintenance work done I was in and out.
No shady work at this place, the mechanic gives you a honest opinion on labor and parts.
They also call to make sure the vehicle is running well.
My motorcycle got an oil change which was done very professionally.
Thanks guys I recommend

My first visit to Automotive Performance Specialists was yesterday.
I was very happy with the service I received.
I felt they really worked hard to make sure I was happy.
I had the AC compressor replaced, and Mike suggested a couple other repairs that needed attention as well.
He took photos of the parts that needed replacement and offered to email them to me.
When all was said and done the entire repair bill was over $200 less than the estimate given to me to by my former mechanic for the compressor alone.
Thanks guys

I've been there 2 times so far.
First time was a small repair and they got me in and out in minutes.
Second time was a bigger repair and they were great!
Friendly people doing honest work for an affordable price.
Just the type of shop everyone needs for their repairs

I Took my motorcycle in it had a nasty Oil leak.
The mechanic was concerned and said he will tighten all loose screws change the oil.
I feel very safe with Automotive Specialist.
Thank you very much for fixing all of my vehicles all I can say is, I am in good hands.
Give them a call I give up!

Mike the Mechanic.
Good as they come very thorough with the job he performs on working on my vehicles I bring to their shop.
Makes it very affordable no complaints here.
THANKS AUTOMOTIVE SPECIALIST
