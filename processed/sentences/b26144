I can't thank this place enough for being so awesome!!!
As some may have seen from my past reviews I had a very bad experience with a mechanic and was so scared to get ripped off again, but I came here and they were very honest and fixed our car in a very efficient time and even went and smogged it for me!
I could not be happier and I HIGHLY recommend them to everyone!!

These guys have really been taking care of me.
I've bounced around for years feeling like every mechanic was ripping me off, until I finally found Johnny D's.
They not only make you feel like family, but they truly want to help you.
I will never go anywhere else ever again.
I friggin' love these guys!

What a great place to get your car fixed.
They shoot you straight and fix only what needs to be fixed.
Very friendly and u feel like part of the family when your car is all done.
There motto is Fixed Right The First Time and that's no Joke.
I have been going to them for years.

The whole crew at Johnny D's is fantastic!!
We called them up to set a drop off time for some maintenance work to be done on our work van.
Drop off went great and pick up the next day before noon was perfect!!
Thank you all for the great personable, customer service.

Great service and fair prices!!
A rare gem in Las Vegas!
