I love sted fast tattoo!
My fianc√© and I also love Chris.
We don't go to anyone else for our ink.
The new shop is in a better neighborhood and has so much more space.
Chris is a perfectionist, which is exactly something you should look for when finding an artist.
Along with his perfectionism, his work is awesome and will do everything to make you happy with your new tattoo.
His lines are clean, his colors stay bright, check out his traditional work and his lettering.
Make sure you contact Chris gasca for you next tattoo.
You will never be disappointed (702) 250-1818.

I got a tattoo with Anthony ,had a blast , all the guys in the shop are super cool I would recommend coming here !

Anthony is AMAZING!
I've been getting tattooed by him for the last 8 years.
Super talented and reasonably priced.
I wouldn't go to anybody but him!
If you're looking for a new artist I recommend this shop and Anthony as your artist!
