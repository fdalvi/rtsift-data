I have had the pleasure of being under Marthas care for the last two years.
She is extremely knowledgable of gynecological, obstetrics, mental health and nutrition.
Plus, she is a nurse practitioner who specializes in women's care.
There are many midwives who have not received the training to do midwifery the correct way.
But Martha has delivered babies along OGBYNs with an amazing patient following.
Martha has saved my mom by using natural hormones.
I encourage all menopause women to see her.
She takes insurance.
The only con is she can run a little late due to spending do much time itch her patients.
