I really like the new Terminal 3 in this Las Vegas Airport.
Good restaurants/bars and the duty free shop has a great selection of booze and all sorts of stuff... so dont spend all your money at the casino!

Great selection!!
You can even taste the wine/alcohol before buying it, Annoyed that I had to wait so long in line, but sh*t happens.

I love how this store has the most interesting selections from technology, sweets, and clothing items.
Not to mention, Gucci watches and jewelry.
I would consider this the high end of ABC stores that leans more towards a department store feel as you can get great gifts minus the tacky touristy items as you travel back home.
However, it comes with a higher price tags as they include the tax into the retail price even though it is considered Duty Free.
This is the place to come for all your needs even if you're looking to space out with some nice new Dre headphones during your 10 hour flight home which is a must.
