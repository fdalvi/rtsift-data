Went to Court's shop at the old location once before and provided amazing service, as I have listed on my previous review.
Came to the new location today to get a Crimestoppers Remote starter installed in my '14 Corolla S. Waited two hours as stated prior to installation.
Waiting area was nice, there was A/C and water was offered.
Friendly staff.
Everyone was very professional; I would def.
recommend 808 Car audio evolution.
Thanks again guys!

Very happy with services hey provided me.
They did a car alarm install the same day I came in just to inquire about prices.
I have been actively shopping around for 5 weeks.
They are a true one stop shop.
Courtney was very informative and willing to help answer all my questions.
Please pay them a visit.
Highly recommend them.

Amazing service!
Very quick and friendly!
Had a car alarm installed and after a couple of months it started acting up.
I brought it back and they installed an upgraded version free of charge!
They're really passionate about their service and that is truly hard to find now a days.
Definitely 5/5 :)

I went to Courteney last August 2013 and inquired about a custom sub box for my car.
Being that my car is a yaris, I wanted to keep the spare and have a functional trunk.
He made a custom box with my specifications and haven't had any problems.
He told me the job would take the entire day - that's fine.
When the job was done, he gave me a call and asked if I could pick up the car.
I couldn't and when he heard that, he offered to drive my car to my house!
What amazing customer service.
Courteney is friendly and did a great job.
I would definitely recommend him to friends and for future stereo install.
Thanks bud!
