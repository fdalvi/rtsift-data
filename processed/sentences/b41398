(Impression mainly from soft opening)  Note: You should love the noble piglet!
Pork and pork based items dominates ~96% of their non-beverage menu.
There has been a lot of buzz regarding the opening of Hiromaru Fusion Ramen since the Ramen Festival at the Rio last year.
And finally they are opened for business!
Excited!!!
What I love about this type of ramen restaurants is the fact that their menu is so simple and straightforward.
Just four (4) ramen to select from, and whether to upgrade some add-ons to the ramen (extra Chashu, roasted seaweed and even cheese!
), or side orders of Gyoza, Chashu Pork Bowl, Karaage, Curry and Hiromaru Buns.
None of that 150 menu items from your typical Chinese American Take-Out restaurants, or the 10 page menus at older American diners.
Essentially their laser focus attention to making what few items they have on their menu to the highest degree of expertise their kitchen crew can mustered on a daily basis is what I admire.
So here is what you can order from their 1 page menu:  Carbonara Ramen ($10.95) - the chef's signature fusion ramen inspired by the Italian Carbonara pasta.
The soup base consist of Tonkotsu pork broth and milk (expect watery broth and not thick traditional Carbonara pasta sauce).
It is topped with still runny egg yolk, bacon, Shio and fresh scallions, resulting in a beautiful presentation of yummy ramenness.
Flat thick noodle is served with this bowl of ramen, I assume to better grip the creamy fusion ramen broth, but eating this without making any unintentional splashes is very difficult.
If you can manage that difficult task, mad props to you Ninja!
Shiroi Tonkotsu ($7.95) - according to the Chef and the menu, "the best salted ramen is created with salted sauce and brown garlic oil.
"  I have not heard or read otherwise, so I shall defer to the ramen expert on this one.
This most traditional of the 4 ramen options is served with Tonkotsu pork broth with salted sauce.
Chashu pork, hard boiled egg, fresh scallions and Kikurage tops thin ramen noodles to complete this entree.
The soup is delicious (at my limit for how salty I like my ramen broth), but I prefer slightly thicker and chewier ramen.
Kuroi Tonkotsu ($8.95) - this is a special salted ramen made with Chef Kawai's master's secret "Ma-Yu" (black garlic oil) recipe.
It is essentially the Shiroi Tonkotsu with the special ma-yu.
Tate-Yama Ramen ($9.95) - easily the tallest ramen you can order from the menu, which is inspired by the largest mountain in Chef Kawai's home prefecture.
The double portion of thick ramen (aka Kaedama) and mounds of vegetables (bean sprouts & cabbage), is served with a soy sauce base + salted sauce and baby-backbone fat, Chasu, hard-boiled egg.
The typical ramen-ya side dishes are available for ordering and some.
The Hiromaru Buns (steamed buns + Butabara pork belly in original Hiromaru sauce) sounds amazing and tasted as good as it looks!
The Japanese mayo with the lettuce was an interesting creamy touch.
Chicken Karaage was fried nicely, but still moist inside and is perfect as is or with a light squeeze of lemon.
No alcohol is served, at least not now, but sodas and teas and bottled water are available to help lower the sodium concentration is your stomach.
The decor is simple and modern, they really did a great job renovating the space vacated by Cafe de Japon.
Even the large "private" room off to the side looks nice and inviting, and ready to accommodate patrons.
Fast service, yummy food and attentive staff, so far so good!
Ramen portion is average or slightly smaller, I can do 2 bowls for sure, maybe 3 bowls when I am in beast mode.
So the 2x ramen noodle option at the time you place your order is recommended if you frequent food eating contests.
5 ramen spoons outta 5.  Review #16 of 2014

This is where Cafe de japon used to be.
They changed it... a lot.
This is a good thing.
Cafe de japon has been replaced with something much, much better.
Right off the bat, the interior is a revelation over the old one.
Everything is redone to a modern and refreshing take on a ramen restaurant.
Squared wooden-looking tables, heavy square seats, ramen spoon and napkin presented nicely, and a nice bright interior to match.
It actually feels a bit like DW Bistro.
Casual and yet upscale in its own way.
The service.
As this place is new, it's still being worked out, but I'm pleased to report it is extremely thorough.
Almost too thorough.
Everything is promptly taken care of.
Items come out all at once, with lots of waiters/waitresses.
There are little touches involving the service like coming by with black pepper grinders for your carbonara ramen.
Speaking of food...
The pork buns.
These were tasty.
First bite, you taste the seasoning on the pork.
The The rest of the bites, you are greeted with the same tender pork, plus mayo.
Usually I'm not a fan of these, but I think these were one of our favorite things.
A simple but tasty creation.
The curry.
Really smooth and strong curry.
Not spicy at all, though the option would be nice.
Served with a piece of tender pork, asparagus, and a slice of red bell pepper.
Again, simple and to the point.
Presented nicely with small portion - closer to a sort of fine-dining experience.
I would actually say avoid this for being $8.50 with little more than rice and curry sauce.
The carbonara ramen.
So, this is exactly what you think it is.
It is carbonara pasta.
Even the pork tastes like bacon, not the same pork you are getting in all the other dishes.
The bowl is presented with an egg yolk in the spoon.
Yup, this is carbonara.
Chopped Japanese mint tossed in for an extra hint of flavor.
This was not our favorite item because we thought it was out of place.
It just wasn't our desired flavor for ramen.
If nobody told us it was ramen, we wouldn't know.
Portion is relatively small compared to most places.
A simple dish outside of the carbonara factor.
Also, nearly impossible to eat without splashing broth everywhere.
Lastly, this is also expensive.
The shiroi tonkotsu.
This is more of the traditional ramen we expected.
The noodles were thinner, and the broth was tasty with a creamy texture.
Savory without being too salty.
More traditional cut of pork over the one in the carbonara.
Again, simple.
It's the purist's ramen, if you will.
It isn't our favorite ramen style.
Again, this is based entirely on the soft opening so take that for what it's worth.
If I were to rate Hiromaru on food alone, it would likely be 3 stars.
The service and experience, 4.5 stars.
For us to return, prices would have to be significantly cheaper considering the sizes/portions and simplicity of it all.

Came here on their 2nd soft opening day.
There was a LOT of waiters/waitresses waiting at the door and greeted us the second the door opened.
Two of my friend's had already arrived by the time, my friend and I had gotten there (oops i took the long way there apparently... XD or rather the slow way haha).
First impressions - LOTS of people working.
Probably to get used to the environment and process.
Decor.
Very simple.
Red and White.
First thought i had, "why does this remind me of In n Out....?
" LOL anyway Design almost kept like how it was when Cafe de Japon existed.
Bar area.
More open now with the various table set ups.
Chairs are a bit bottom heavy, so not too easy to move.
Each person is served with a small salad bowl, even before ordering.
(surprising)   Since it is still their soft opening, they were not offering their complete menu.
Carbonara Ramen - $10.95 - "Signature ramen noodle fusion inspired by popular Italian Carbonara pasta.
" A soup base with the original tonkotsu pork broth and milk.
Toppings included is an egg yolk , bacon, shiso, and fresh scallions.
The type of noodle selected for this ramen is flat, thick noodles.
First impression, something new to try.
Their rendition of a popular italian dish, in a japanese style.
Soup base, is light, due to the broth being mixed with milk (which i dont think is normal cow milk, reminds me of soy milk, maybe?).
Noodles are thick, non-traditional ramen noodles, which you don't see often, but cooked to a nice al dente, which gives a nice bite !
=D The egg yolk, im pretty sure was laid in raw, and left with the broth to cook slightly?
gives a nice rich flavor overall.
Bacon, gives a nice flavor, esp since they had it lightly seared on a grill, but not a fan of bacon.
The shiso leaf, actually look me off guard.
Gives, something along the lines of maybe a basil flavor?
Overall, this ramen is not bad, since its lighter than the shiroi tonkotsu ramen.
Not my favorite, but i like the noodles they use.
Shiroi Tonkotsu Ramen - $7.95 - "The best salted ramen is created with salted sauce and brown garlic oil.
" A soup base with the original tonkotsu pork broth with salted sauce.
Toppings included is chashu pork, hard-boiled egg, fresh scallions, and kikurage.
The type of noodle selected for this ramen is thin noodle.
Thin noodles.
Overcooked in my opinion.
Cooked a bit too long.
Lost its "bite".
The soup is quite salty.
Probably from the "salted sauce"... whatever that could be.
Very heavy in garlic flavor, mostly from the garlic oil.
It was surprising to me they did hard-boiled eggs.
I'd prefer a soft-boiled egg with a runny yolk.
The "kikurage" (wood-ear fungus) is quite normal to be in a japanese style ramen.
The thing that was nice to me, was the chashu.
In comparison to like Monta, this was not fatty at all.
Majority meat, with a thin line of fat.
A nice touch is they seared it on a grill.
Adds a nice flavor to it.
Not a bad ramen, though soup base with the salted sauce (what is this?!?
) is quite salty.
During this soft opening, they also had a few side orders available.
Hiromaru Gyoza - $5.50 - Grilled pork dumpling  Hiromaru Buns - $6.00 - Two steamed buns filled with butabara (pork belly) and served with Hiromaru original sauce  Karaage - $5.00 - Japanese fried chicken  Pretty good !
to start off, the meat is a dark meat.
On top of that, its marinated/seasoned so even the inside of the meat is flavorful.
The batter used is not too thick, and is nice and crispy.
Nice side to get !
HIromaru Japanese Curry - $8.50 - Japanese style curry rice with chashu pork  To be honest, upon bring brought out this order, first thing that came to mind, was "overpriced".
At $8.50, you get about the amount of a small bowl of rice, in a pool of curry sauce, ONE slice of pork, two short spears of asparagus, and a sliver of red bell pepper.
The curry sauce, .... very UNDER-whelming.
Flavor wasn't there.
Felt diluted.
Not flavorful at all, like some curry.
Some had said its like what you would get from a box of curry, at a grocery store.
To me, it was not strong at all.
I tasted the sauce straight up.
If i had ate it with rice, id be like... uhhh wheres the curry?
Aside from that, ONE slide of pork?
really?
wow...   Service wise, they were very attentive.
They picked up finished bowls quickly, and were quick to refill on water.
Hope their attentive service will last after opening.
On the side note, they have another room, decorated differently next door.
The waitress had told us it is for dinner service for the izakaya?
as well has some private VIP rooms too.
The decor is complete opposite of the original side.
Overall, not bad for a soft opening and new style.
Would like to come back to try different side dishes next time (gyoza and buns) as well as the other two ramen they offer on their menu.
For the price (ramen), i'd say they should include one more slide of pork though.
Seemed a little "skimped out" on only have 1 slice....

There is no doubt that Hiromaru is the hottest new business for anyone who attended or followed the Aki Matsuri festival for the ramen, or for ramen fans in general.
I didn't attend the festival, but I am aware that Hiromaru presented a very popular offering there and made it known that they were planning an outpost here in Vegas  Fast forward about half a year and I got a tip from my friend that they were finally ready to open.
There were a couple issues over the weekend that pushed back the opening just a little, but I'm just thankful that I  have been lucky enough to have eaten here three times now.
Got welcomed to soft opening #1 through expressing keen interest to them in-person and on the phone, and subsequently went to soft opening #2 last night and grand opening day today.
I will go over the items that I had so as not to make this sound too much like a story or event review.
I deliberately waited until opening day to post this, so I am judging mainly on food quality, service being a work in progress and price of food being non-existent for my first two visits.
House salad: this is a complimentary little bowl of greens and oil that they present to every customer upon arrival.
I found some of the purple leaves a little bitter, but it's a nice fresh start and a welcome  Hiromaru Buns: butabara pork belly in a white bun with some sort of house-made mayo.
I enjoyed it.
I'm told that it's not as good as Fat Choy, which I still haven't tried, but it is at the very least a competent offering.
[UPDATE 3/12: tried Fat Choy's pork belly bao, which utterly blows this out of the water, but that's mainly a testament as to how good Fat Choy is.
]  Karaage: your typical ball-ish fried chicken with a slice of lemon and a little lettuce.
It wasn't that crunchy on the first day, but it was on the second day.
If karaage is your thing, try it.
Hiromaru Japanese Curry: rice, typical yellow curry, and chashu pork belly.
Not spicy.
I could not and will not get myself to like this enough.
It tastes fine, but I just wouldn't order it knowing that Japanese Curry Zen is just down the street.
Shiroi Tonkotsu: the "basic" ramen with chashu pork, half of a hard-boiled egg, scallions, and kikurage mushrooms.
I tried this on the first night and wasn't impressed overall.
The sesame-heavy broth really, really threw me for a loop.
I also didn't like the hard boiled egg as a stylistic choice vs. soft-boiled, but I thought the noodles were decent (maybe not al dente) and the chashu pork belly was nice because it's meaty much more so than fatty.
Maybe I'll try it again in the future, but my grade would be an Incomplete for this.
Carbonara Ramen: this is the one that you want to have, seeing as how you're going to a place with "fusion ramen" in its name.
It has a lot more to do with a carbonara pasta than it does with typical ramen.
The thick noodles are al dente, the egg lends a nice flavor to the broth, and the thick-cut bacon, while predominantly chewy, completes the experience.
Couldn't taste the sesame for some reason (was the milk that helpful?
), so I enjoyed the shiso-accented broth.
Because it is a fusion ramen, I would not directly call it better or worse than my favorites at Fukumimi and Sora, but mainly different.
Kuroi Tonkotsu: basically, Shiroi plus black garlic oil.
This is what I chose today because they were out of Carbonara and Tate-Yama supplies at the time for whatever reason.
I am very glad that i tried this because 1) now I know that the shiroi flavor the first night wasn't a fluke, and 2) I got more accustomed to the sesame flavor enough to enjoy the ramen today.
I would still not pick this ramen over Fukumimi or Sora, but I think I would rank this above Monta, which really has not impressed me as of late.
This is a very promising ramen shop with a dedicated management team, and you should know that they're still ironing out the kinks in the first week.
But so what if they took ten minutes to give me my check?
I can't hold it against them at this point.
Give them a try some time and see what you think!

Located in the Cathay Hills plaza near Lindell Road, the signage is easy to spot.
The restaurant has a clean, modern design.
White, red, and wood fixtures and furniture.
There is also a second dining area with booths and beautiful lighting.
It's definitely more spacious than most ramen joints.
Lots of light, very welcoming.
I was really looking forward to trying their Cabonara or Tate-Yama Ramen, but they weren't serving either today (the soft openings possibly depleted their thick noodle supply).
So, we ordered the only other two ramen choices available: Shiroi and Kuroi.
Shiroi Tonkotsu ($7.95): Pork broth with "salted sauce" and brown garlic oil, served with thin noodles, and topped with chashu pork, hard boiled egg, fresh scallions, and kikurage.
The broth had a really nice creaminess that was almost milky.
The garlic oil was surprisingly light.
It had a great depth and flavor.
The noodles were good and the pork wasn't fatty.
Kuroi Tonkotsu ($8.95): Completely identical to the Shiroi Tonkotsu except it's made with ma-yu (black garlic oil) instead of the brown garlic oil.
The flavors are similar, but the black garlic is a bit more robust.
Both broths were both delicious in their own way.
We also shared two side dishes, Karaage ($5) and Hiromaru Special Fried Rice ($6.50) made with egg, chashu pork, and scallions.
The Karaage had a light batter and good flavor.
I loved the squeeze of fresh lemon on the chicken too.
The fried rice was very tasty!
The chashu pork and scallions flavored it nicely.
The service was friendly and I was surprised to find that Mr. Kawai was in the kitchen since he has his six locations in Toyama, Japan.
Anyway, I will be making my way back next week to try the thick noodle ramens!

*This review is based on the grand opening.
I'm sure to go back to Hiromaru and see if I'll make any changes to my review*  Saw that Hiromaru was opening a location in Vegas and I was excited.
I had gone to the Japanese festival and tried their ramen months ago.
I loved it so this was big news.
I came here on the grand opening and was greeted by a huge staff.
They were all so welcoming!
The interior is pretty hip with its red and white decor.
My boyfriend and I already knew to get the carbonara ramen because that was what we tried at the festival.
Carbonara ramen is $10.95.
Pretty pricey in my opinion.
We also got a chashu bowl for almost $7.
After ordering we were given complimentary salads.
The salad had a refreshing dressing on top.
We got our chashu bowl first.
The chashu is topped with chopped greens and a sauce which I don't know the name of, all on top of rice.
If you've been to monta, it's nothing like it.
I personally prefer fried chashu.
This pork seemed to be steamed because of how soft it was.
Don't get me wrong, it still tasted fine!
Now onto the ramen.
The carbonara has THICK noodles with a milky tonkatsu broth.
It comes with bacon, but I switched it out for chashu for no charge.
Lastly, it has an egg yolk on your spoon that goes with it.
The broth was thicker than what I had at the festival but it still tasted great.
If it was thinner it'd be perfect.
The noodles were huge.
It's like udon except harder.
I don't know how to feel about the noodles to be honest.
The ramen tasted different than what I had at the japanese festival.
It was kinda disappointing but the ramen was appetizing regardless.
I'm sure to go back and try their other ramen.

I visited Hiromaru on their grand opening and wasn't personally all that impressed.
Their menu is very simple.
Only four types of Ramen and a few other extras such as Karaage, curry and buns.
We started our meal with their Hiromaru buns.
My pork belly was tough , like I could barely chew through the meat.
So I was left a bit underwhelmed with my bun experience.
Secondly I really wanted to try their carbonara ramen since I've heard that is the show stealer, unfortunately they were out.
I heard they had a great soft opening but its kind of a disappointment not to have star menu items on their grand opening day.
So I ended up settling for the Shiroi Tonkotsu ramen with extra chashu.
The broth was tasty but I personally wasn't a fan of the noodles.
I like a slightly thicker noodle.
The chashu was good but almost all fat with very little "meat.
" Overall it was just an ok ramen experience for me.
Maybe I'm just a creature of habit and prefer Ramen Sora.
Although I wasn't the biggest fan of Hiromaru I will return purely for the interest of the Carbonara ramen.

This review is solely based on their second day of soft opening on March 4th, 2014.
After hearing how Hiromaru will be taking over Cafe de Japon's location, I was excited.
No wait, let me rephrase.
I was ecstatic.
Especially after trying some of their ramen at the Japanese Festival, which took place at Rio last year -- I just couldn't wait.
And now it has finally opened.
After much of my nagging and broken record-esq behavior .. my three friends and I made our way to Hiromaru for a late lunch on that Tuesday.
We got there a little bit after 3 PM and the restaurant was fairly empty.
We were greeted as soon as I opened the door and were seated right away.
Well, two of my friends arrived earlier, so Andrew C. and I just joined them at the table.
The menu for Hiromaru is fairly simple.
There are a total of 4 different ramens for you to choose from and about 7 side order/appetizers.
Now, because it was still soft opening, everything that we ordered was free.
However, it was a limited menu.
We were limited to two different ramens: the carbonara ramen and the shiroi tonkotsu.
As for the sides, we got to choose from: Hiromaru buns (pork buns), karaage (fried chicken), and Hiromaru Japanese curry.
Andrew C. and I decided to get the carbonara ramen and shiroi tonkotsu so we could try both and share.
And our friends decided to get a side of the karaage and Japanese curry.
After we ordered our food, we were served a small bowl of salad right away to start our meal, which was nice.
And before we knew it, our orders were filtering out ....  Hiromaru Japanese Curry ($8.50) - this side dish was the first to come out.
It came with a small bowl/plate of curry, rice, slice of pork, and asparagus.
I didn't like it.
The curry was runny, watery, and pretty average.
It reminds me of the type of curry that you buy at grocery stores in boxes where you mix water in with powder to create the dish.
You can skip this.
Karaage ($5.00) - Only one phrase could justify this side dish.
"Surprisingly good.
" Seasoned dark meat deep fried with a light batter.
It was delicious.
Try it.
Carbonara Ramen ($10.95) - This dish is your east and west fusion into one.
Nothing can get more fusion than this right?!
I mean, carbonara RAMEN?
Where do you find this?
At Hiromaru.
From what I've heard and read, this is what made Hiromaru famous.
The amazing creativity behind this is beyond genius.
But I'm confused about what I'm supposed to be thinking while eating it.
The soup base is tonkotsu with milk.
It didn't look creamy per say, but it was a milky texture.
Flavor wise, it was a little bland.
If no one told me it was a tonkotsu base, I would've never known.
There was two strips of bacon in there as well.
They were grilled before hand.
You know what would have made it even better?
If it was cut up in pieces like it was shown in the picture on their menu.
The noodles were a little flat and thick.
It's typically not the type of noodles I prefer in ramen but it was cooked perfectly.
It was al-dente, just the way I like it.
Shiroi Tonkotsu ($7.95) - Was this what I ate during the ramen festival?
It tasted a whole lot different here.
First bite?
Delicious.
Second bite?
Wonderful.
Third, fourth, fifth, sixth bite?
I think I'm going to have to pass.
This was a tonkotsu soup base with salted sauce and brown garlic oil.
The soup was light but heavy in flavor.
It was salty and garlic-y.
I normally like salty foods but too much of it, especially in something heavy such as this, can get boring.
After the first bite, I knew that this dish could risk running a flat line for me.
Too much of something is still too much and in this case, I think the salted sauce tipped it over.
The slice of pork, however, was nicely seasoned but because of how salty the soup is, it was an overkill for me.
Everything started tasting the same.
Aside from that, the shiroi ramen came with thin noodles but they were a bit on the softer side, which meant that they slightly overcooked it.
Now, don't get me wrong .. the food is good but I'm not sure if it's for me.
Though, I may definitely go again just to see if they did anything different from the soft opening.
I may have to ask if they can skip the salted sauce and make sure the noodles are al dente as well.
Overall, I think disappointment may be the word for this little trip.
Hopefully my second trip here will be better.

Any ideas you may have about Ramen...get rid of them.
Hiromaru opens a whole brave new world of flavors in ramen.
From their thicker, house-made noodles to the taste of fresh-cut shizo, the scrambled egg still sizzling on the plate with the presentation of the fried rice...There is nothing like this in Vegas.
I had the Carbonara ramen, which was absolutely perfect.
But I really don't think you can go wrong on their menu, even with the non ramen items.
Their karaagge is far and away the best I've ever had.
This place is wonderful.
If you like ramen or japanese at all, get to Hiromaru.
Now.

My wife and I were excited to try this place.
The seating is a bit strange and the lights are a bit bright.
We ordered 2 bowls of ramen and karaage.
35 mins go by and we notice guests who arrived 15 mins after us already eating.
A guy in a suit comes by and asks us "How long have you been waiting?
"  I tell him a long time and he asks us if we would like anything else from the menu.
My wife tells him that we just want what we ordered.
I think they finally realized that they gave our food to the wrong table or somehow lost our order.
Some more time goes by and we get up and walk across the way to Cathay House for some chinese food.
Very disappointed as the food looked good.

Simple menu but everything we ordered was tasty.
The service was definitely 5 star.
Towards the end of our meal, a waiter asked if we enjoyed our meal and for any recommendation on what they can improve.
We felt that the fried rice and the carbonara ramen could use less salt.
But other than that, the flavors were spot on.We can wait to try this place again.

I came to Hiromaru today and I feel like it would be wrong for me not to write a review to warn people of the food.
I am really confused as to how this place got so many 5 star reviews.
First things, first.
There was mad construction being done on the restaurant... they were straight up building a door with hammers and shiet right inside.
I had to ask to see if they were open because I honestly was not sure.
Once we came inside we were seated in the room where they were doing construction rather than the other quieter room.
I got a front row seat to the construction guy's belly hanging out of his pants.
Sometimes I couldn't hear what people were saying over the hammering.
If you don't have your door built, why are you open?
We tried the karaage chicken, pork buns, and shiroi tonkatsu ramen.
The karaage chicken was nice and crispy but lacked flavor.
I like the karaage chicken from Tonkatsu Kiyoshi much more.
The pork buns were disappointing.
The pork belly is served in a bun with a mayo type of sauce.
The pork was not appetizing and tasted of nothing.
More seasoning needed.
The ramen was flavorful in the soup... the shiroi is much creamier than expected.
It almost looked like the carbonara ramen in the menu.
The ramen noodles were not ramen.
They were closer in texture to spaghetti.
Some sort of wheat pasta... nothing like the bouncy yellowish noodles you would expect.
They were clumped together in our bowls... we had to literally use our chopsticks to separate them.
The eggs were not a nice soft boil but an overdone hard boiled egg (and served cold somehow, not freshly prepared).
They didn't have any condiments for the ramen on the table and when I asked the waitresses seemed confused as to what I wanted.
They don't have sesame seeds or chili pepper.
They gave me chili oil and sriracha sauce... the chili oil was okay but they need to have condiments on the table at a ramen restaurant.
Overall very disappointed and almost offended... had to stop by Big Wong and get something after my meal that I could enjoy.
I am sorry Hiromaru... nice try.

Excellent food, great service, and the prices were just right for the portions.
They just opened so they have a working menu in progress.
No alcohol yet.
:-(

YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(69/365)  "Hiromaru is HERE!!!
"  This is the latest Ramen spot to open up in Chinatown, and after people had a little taste of Hiromaru at the Aki Matsuri Festival, Yelpers are making the trek here like a bunch of flies on a freshly made turd!
In the former Cafe De Japon spot, the interior has been redone with bursts of red and white, and the other half of the room still under construction to feature more Japanese Fusion items.
We ordered The Carbonara($10.95),  Karaage($5), and Tate-Yama Ramen($9.95) The Karaage, although juicy, barely had flavor, pretty skimpy, and lacked the crisp exterior I'm used to having in other tastier versions.
Our Ramen arrives, and the portions are pretty huge!
Wifey's Carbonara is very good, as was mine, but the Tate-Yama advertised a double portion of the thick noodles....my bowl was more like one third thick noodles and two third bean sprouts.
Banchan for days I tell you!
Another bummer?
Hard boiled egg...:( It advertises it on the menu, but there's nothing like SOFT boiled egg with your ramen IMHO....  Great thick noodles, and very tasty broth, but the kinks still need to be refined, and we'll definitely return when Hiromaru is up to speed.
ALOHA!!!
Shaka Meter:  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uu  3.5  *Great thick noodles with perfect texture and tasty broths, they'll only get better as time goes by...

Hiromaru originated in Japan and they still have locations there.
They have 2 doors - use the left one.
My main mission was to try their black garlic ramen since that's my favorite ramen of all.
I was very impressed with how clean and slick the interior looks.
Red accent wall, white walls, red chairs - my favorite color.
I had great expectations but I was very much disappointed.
This replaced the good ol' Cafe de Japon (you will be missed).
I thought this place would be packed since they're new and people would want to try this place - but no.
I went here with Tu Anh and Tony who've been here a few times since they opened.
We got some appetizers.
I asked for oolong tea but they ran out of tea.
Seriously?
We were given a mixed greens salad with a light dressing and immedicately, Tony said the salad was better when they first opened.
Hiromaru Buns: The pork  belly was tasty.
It has greens and Kewpie (Japanese mayo) in it.
I lost the pork belly somewhere in the steamed buns.
Too much bun, not enough meat.
3.5/5  Gyoza: I've never been so disappointed with gyoza before.
One side is supposed to be soft and the other side crisp with slight burn marks.
Well, theirs has burn marks around one side of each gyoza and the rest seemed raw.
According to cooking expert, Tony this is due to the fact that it was cooked from frozen.
The pork filling didn't have much taste and the dipping sauce had too much soy sauce.
1/5  Kuroi Tonkotsu: Thin noodles in tonkotsu pork broth with ma-yu/ black garlic oil topped with 3 thin slices of chashu pork, hard-boiled egg, kikurage, and scallions.
There's not enough broth.
3.5/5  Kaedama: Tony let me try his thick flat noodles for comparison since we have the same broth anyway.
These noodles are unnecessarily chewy.
It was like chewing on cartilage.
I heard/felt a pop from my mouth - my jaw locked for a second.
"They were softer the other time I went here".
1/5  Those red chairs are so darn heavy.
I workout but I was not expecting those suckers to be THAT heavy.
I kinda like my back and I don't want to break it.
The consensus: INCONSISTENCY.
How things were cooked and tasted on opening day is different from 2 days ago and last night.
I'm willing to give them another try and hopefully, I catch them on a "good night".
I would have to go to Carson/Torrance for my favorite bowl of black garlic ramen for now.
*sigh*

I really wanted to like this place as I heard so many great reviews given their history and when they were at the Ramen Festival at Rio.
I believe most of the issues are due to execution but for starters, you are literally blinded when you walk in.....Man it is bright.
There are HUGE red chairs to plop yourself into.
The complimentary salad was a nice gesture but after that things were just aight.
We ordered the Shiroi, Kuroi, and the Tate-Yama selections.
The Carbonara sounded great but I don't know if I could do a full bowl as I imagine it would be pretty rich.
For the 3 Ramen's we found the broth to be too salty.
Noodles were either really over cooked (Shiroi and Kuroi) or slightly under cooked (Tate Yama)   I personally liked the noodles in the Tate-Yama as they were probably the thickest ramen noodles I ve ever eaten but based on other reviews I can understand where people are coming from as they are thick and doughy.
The Tate-Yama was my favorite - i love bean sprouts and it was topped with a mountain.
Overall everything was decent.
I would come back to give it a second chance but i wont be rushing.
Businesss was pretty slow - hopefully this is just opening jitters.

During my first visit here I got the second ramen item on the menu and the pork buns.
The broth was so salty and the thin noodle was overcooked - so terrible that I had to stop eating after a quarter into the bowl.
The pork buns were dripping with grease.
Gross.
I told Tony T. that I'd never come back to this place again.
Fast forward a week later, the lovely Cathy C. asked me to meet her here before going over to Cafe Teaze.
When Cathy C asked to meet with you at a food place, you don't say no.
So of course I agreed!
This time, I asked for the carbonara as I heard praises about it.
This turned out to be a huge mistake!!!
They used bigger noodle for this ramen item.
Unfortunately, the noodle was so undercooked this time that it was barely edible.
On a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is super overcooked, 1 is raw and 5 is al dente, this noodle was probably somewhere around 2 or 3.
My dining friends agreed with me on this.
You can't pay me to come back here ever again.

Today was my first visit here (3/16/14).
I, along with my parents were disappointed and we won't be back for sure.
I understand it's only been few weeks but as much as I tried to like this place, I just couldn't.
ATMOSPHERE: Spacious but the lighting was too much for me.
Too bright!
Good lighting for a selfie I guess lol  FOOD: Carbonara ramen-didn't really like the thick noodle but that may just be a personal preference.
Enjoyed the first two bites, then regretted the fact that I mixed in egg yolk with soup.
Soup was kind of oily and couldn't keep eating after halfway.
It's very unique but I didn't like anything about it.
Kuroi tonkotsu-my mom ordered this and according to her, it's a little bitter.
She enjoyed the thin noodles.
Tateyama ramen-lots of bean sprouts.
My dad ordered this and he liked the broth.
He didn't enjoyed the thick noodles.
STAFF: I felt really uncomfortable because they stood by our table and watched us eat O_O.
When my dad finished taking the last bite, this lady quickly came by and took away the bowl.
He was going to enjoy the broth but I guess that's a part of a good service (?
)   CONCLUSION: Not coming back

We had the Carbonara, the Shiroi Tonkotsu, and the Kuroi Tonkotsu.
The Carbonara was rich and creamy, perfectly seasoned, with an interesting wide noodle, just really beautifully done.
The Shiroi was the table favorite hands down.
Slightly creamy, but not heavy, Noodles cooked to perfection, not overdone.
It was a perfect balance of flavors.
The Kuroi was earthy and meaty.
Very enjoyable.
I think this may be a wintertime favorite for me.
The atmosphere was hip, crisp, and clean.
And we had great service from all of the ladies there.
I'll definitely be going back again.
And I can't wait to try the Tate-Yama

There are some things in life that are constant--the way ramen is presented and the way ramen tastes, but Hiromaru flips ramen on its head and takes it to a new level.
There are three things that are important in ramen: noodles, broth, and taste.
We all know the common ramen joints around our cities that deliver the standard pork broth or soy broth with noodles, topped with egg and a few pieces of meat and mushrooms.
Not Hiromaru.
This restaurant is a new ramen experience, with fare such as cabonara ramen and black garlic tonkatsu ramen.
The menu is short and sweet.
As with any great ramen place, there are appetizers, sides, and then the main ramen dishes.
Instead of fifteen option, Hiromaru has 4--Shiroi, which is their brown garlic oil broth, the Kuroi, which is black garlic oil broth, Tate Yama, which is a huge and has that great pork fatty taste with flat noodles, and his Cabonara ramen, which is a creamy ramen broth.
We started with a few popular appetizers--pork bun, karaage, and the special fried rice.
All of them were excellent.
The karaage arrived first.
This is as simple and beautiful as karaage gets.
The batter was extremly light and crispy and did not require any dipping sauce or soy sauce.
With a light squeeze of lemon, this karaage was perfect.
We were also presented with fried rice.
I love playful food.
You break down the rice and mix the egg and everything together in order to eat.
With the hot plate underneath, this fried rice stays nice and hot, and all the flavors of the pork with the salty egg and the sweet, green onions is divine.
I could eat a whole order to myself.
The last appetizer to arrive were the pork buns, which were different from others sold around town.
As with the other apps, minimalist food is the most beautiful and tasty, and this pork bun was heaven in my mouth.
Instead of the melty pork pieces that other restaurants have, this one is thick, chewy, but is gorgeous in every way.
The pork texture in contrast with the soft,  sweet bun was just heaven.
With a slight crispy and fresh note from the sauce and greens, this is something I would come back for time and again.
With the appetizer round complete, the ramen arrived, and it was something unique to the eye from what I am used to.
The black garlic oil provided a dark tinge to the ramen broth, which looked alien.
As I began to mix the ramen up, the milky pork broth became visible and all the flavors melded.
The noodles are different at Hiromasu.
They feel thinner but tastier, with more cling to the broth than other ramen.
The milky, black broth was absolutely delicious.
With the black garlic's smoky and sweet flavor against the pork broth, the umami was amazing.
I sat, face down in my bowl, slurping and sipping away quietly, trying to figure out what other flavors were layered in the broth.
With every chopstick-full of noodles, I appreciated every ounce of flavor within the universe of my bowl.
This broth is lovely and made me contemplate my ramen-filled life.
I drank every last drop leaving nothing but a dry ramen bowl to be taken from me.
I sat quietly after the entire meal, kindly paid my check, and walked out a bit stunned by the excellent food this place provides.
Given, the service is lacking, but the food is worth a return time and again.
Hiromasu brings more than simple ramen to the city--you can taste the experience, the love, and the beauty of what ramen should always be.

Ate Kuroi tonkotsu and it was pretty good.
A bit too "kotteri" to my taste but I know it's been a trend for Ramen shops in Japan.
This place has been added to my cyclic visits for Ramen.

I heard a new ramen place opened up in town so my friend & I checked it out last night.
The restaurant is fairly big- probably the biggest ramen place in town.
We went around 6:30p so there was only one party and we were seated immediately and the food came out real quick!
I ordered the shiroi tonkotsu ramen which is the white pork based soup with a hint of garlic.
It was delicious!
My friend ordered the tateyama ramen- this ramen was full of bean sprouts and the noodles were thick so it filled you up, she couldn't even finish it.
But she said it was good!
Lots of parking spots outside of the restaurant!
Came back for the second time & this time I tried the curry.
It was good!
Has a little kick to it at the end of each bite but that's what makes it good.
Sweet at first but a little spicy too!

Tried the kuroi tonkatsu.
Its was pretty good.
My friend got the carbonara ramen, liked that better.
I would recomend to others but kinda pricy.

Omfg, i had their ramen at Yokocho Ramen Festival in California and it was sofa king delicious!
It was my first time having a beef broth based ramen and the buttery accents in the white colored broth were very fragrant.
Absolutely loved the ramen noodle consistency and although the toppings were few, the noodles and soup base were incredibly mouthwatering and that's what is most important.

Me and my boyfriend went here last week.
The decor was AMAZING, it looks so clean and modern.
The chairs are a bit heavy to drag around though.
Needless to say, there are good points and bad points to this place.
Pros: The customer service is really good!
I ordered kuroi ramen but I didn't like it at all, and my boyfriend forced me to ask the waitress to change my order to a tate-yama.
I felt so bad but she was okay with it and she was really cheerful too.
Cons: The broth is really garlic heavy.
That can be a good or bad thing depending on your personal taste for garlic.
I first ordered the kuroi ramen since my boyfriend got shiroi.
I took a bite and it was so... bitter.
Maybe it's because I'm not used to mayu, but I didn't like it at all.
When I reluctantly changed my order I decided to get tate-yama, and that thing was huge.
When I dug in though, I realized why that thing was so huge... it's a huge mountain of bean sprouts.
Literally.
A tate-yama.
I could barely dig through the bean sprouts to get ramen and chashu.
I miiiight go back to this place once they get the hang of things over the few months.
Every restaurant starts out on a bumpy start anyway, so I'm willing to give this place another try in a couple months.

Craving for ramen I decided to try the new place in town and headed to Hiromaru fusion ramen.
I'm no very comfortable with the fusion word in restaurants since I'm a firm believer that original  is better.
Having said that there has been some instances when mixing two cuisines something wonderful is created so I went ahead and ordered the ramen carbonara and quickly realized this wasn't one of those instances.
For me the ramen carbonara was like some version of Olive Garden's carbonara complete with the waitress grinding fresh pepper into my plate and as she asks me to tell her when to stop.
The soft melt in my mouth pork that I'm used to in ramen dishes was nothing more than plain bacon in this dish and the broth tasted like a very watery Alfredo sauce.
Service is good all the employees are very attentive and try their best to make you feel comfortable although the atmosphere of the dining room is not very  inviting, for the lights are very bright and the combination of mostly white and red accents of the room made me feel like I was eating in the middle of a target store commercial shooting.
More earthy colors could make this place more welcoming and dimmer lighting more relaxing.
On a different note, I can't exactly recall what they were playing but the music was awesome but so was the music I was playing in my car on my way home wishing I've would've had some real Japanese ramen.
I may come back again but next time I'll order something more authentic from the menu, for now I'll give this place three stars.

We were on our way to Ramen Sora and saw the sign, so we thought "nightclub as well".
The first thing we were impressed by was the atmosphere.
The layout is day/night.
One room is white and brightly lit, the other is dark.
For lunch we decided to start with the gyoza, fried chicken, and pork belly buns.
They were all delicious.
(Although they were spiced for the gringo pallet).
Our entrees were both ramen.
Shannon had carbonara ramen (yup Parmesan ramen) with an egg yolk.
I had the black garlic noodles.
Both were good, but not as good as the appetizers.
Bottom line, we'll definitely be back.
Probably more for the appetizers than the soup.

Not much variety.
Some of the ramen dishes are milk based and not very good.
Nevertheless the fried rice and the pork were good.
They dont serve beer or wine.
I did like the decour and the service was friendly enough.

The decorations very nice, the Ramen soup is tasty not too salty, Ramen is perfect.
They seem a little rushing to me.

Do they have to charge $2 for their kroger brand hot tea?
I mean Shuseki brew their own with no charge.
I had their tate-yama ramen, the broth wasnt as rich as described i think the bean sprouts made it bland.
The thick noodles was tender the way i like it but the chasiu topping was too thin compare to ramen sora.
Soft opening menu this time, maybe it will be better next time.
Good luck Hiromaru!

Short:  Food: ehhh Ambiance: bright, clean Service: good  Long: Food: My group of 9 was able to try all the ramens and several appetizers.
Here's what I remember / what I had a chance to try Karaage - liked the flavor, but was not as crispy as I would have liked Fried rice - really good!
Definitely recommend it Shiro ramen - wayyyy tooo salty.
SO salty.
The texture of the noodles was perfect, but the broth was soooo salty as to be borderline inedible.
Kuro(i) ramen - I thought this was better than the shiro ramen, and it was nice that they use a lot of the oil.
Some places only use a little bit, rather than saturating the soup with it.
Carbonara ramen - I did not get a chance to try this, but it was a hit at the table.
Ambiance: Nice and bright, clean.
The chairs don't have backs, which was fine, except that it meant I had to put my purse on the floor (there was no room on the table), which I am not a huge fan of.
I also didn't have anywhere to put my jacket, so I just folded it up and sat on it.
Perhaps they should add little hooks to the table or wall where we can hang our bags and / or coats.
Service: Good, not really memorable.
They did a fantastic job of splitting the bill without an attitude and waited until our entire party arrived to take our order (though we were allowed to be seated).
I would come here again if I was in town, but would not drive all the way from Henderson - easier to just go to Monta on Eastern if it's not going to be that much better.

Ramen is fusion, Carbonara Ramen is a creative take on Ramen.
I tried the Black Garlic Ramen and the taste was ok, I will definitely come back and try their carbonara Ramen.
We tried the Fried Rice with Chashu hot plate and it was good.
The karaage was really good.
The place was well designed and roomy.

First impression: Right when I walked in I was blinded by the vibrant red/white walls and contemporary furnitures.
Definitely woke me up in a good way.
Service: fast and snappy.
The server made sure my glass didn't run out of water.
I appreciated that.
Gosh, their sevice = top notched compared to every other restaurants on Spring Mountain.
Food: I ordered Kuroi ramen.
It came with a complementary salad.
It was alright.
As for the ramen, it was definitely different (keep the word "fusion" in mind).
I'm so used to Monta and Ramen Sora, I guess it was dumb of me to expect the typical taste of ramen.
Their ramen is definitely something you have to get used to.

I had the shiroi tonkotsu and a dessert.
The decor was visually interesting but the red square chairs were heavy.
Quick side note:  Considering the color scheme is red and white, why are the two color-themed ramens kuroi (black) and shiroi (white)?
They could develop a tantanmen or a spicy ramen  and call it "akai" (red) lol   The service was fine and prompt with seating, placing the order, refilling my drinks and clearing the table.
In my opinion, they could learn how to explain/promote the menu items better.
The shiroi tonkotsu was fine, nothing to rant about, nothing to rave about.
I liked the generous amount of bean sprouts you add for $1.
I did not like the kikurage mushrooms being cold.
I had to press/drown them in the broth in order to heat them up.
What I was most impressed with was the dessert.
It was a yellow cake with a layer of pear fruit and thick cream dolloped on top.
It was surrounded by a liquor-based(?
) sauce and dressed with berries and morsels of chocolate.
It was delicious and I find it odd that such a fancy dessert is served in a casual restaurant setting.
My taste buds are not complaining as this was the star of the meal.
I might come back to try the izakaya side of the menu.

I don't know what the rage about this place was but we ordered the Gyoza, the shiro tonkastu and the carbonara ramen and were more than disappointed.
The gyoza tasted like it was last night's take out order that's been reheated and the soup base in both ramen dishes tasted like instant soup mix.
The service is ok and the atmosphere is good.
I just wish the food could taste less processed and more... Like it was cooked from scratch or something.

Last week was my second time coming here.
I've had all the ramen on the menu from both visits.
I can say all of them are good & they're not traditional Japanese noodles.
They're definitely "fusion".
It was something different & I loved it!
In all everything was amazing!
Staff is great & under the tables, there is a place for people to put their belongings when they eat.
I cannot wait till they open the other side of the restaurant as Izakaya!

I just ate here, so I thought I better write my review while its still fresh in my mind.
Overall this is a beautiful restaurant and a terrific place to eat.
I will come back and recommend it to other people.
Food and service was great!
We ate here on a Thursday around 6 pm; not a busy time.
We were quickly seated by the friendly manager.
And the waitress was excellent; graciously attentive.
We ordered the beers, Karrage, Carbonara ramen and Black garlic ramen.
Ice cold glasses filled with fresh Asahi draft.
Karaage was hot and delicious; we shared a plate but we should've ordered two.
We received complimentary edemame.
The soups were beautiful and tasty.
The Carbonara was delicious, but I preferred the black garlic.
We need to come back for dessert!
My critiques are minor.
I think the south wall of the restaurant could use some color or more decoration.
The wall now just feels to empty.
The red cube ottoman seats are cumbersome.
They are hard to pull out and scoot in.
They should have an upholsterer add handles to the upper sides.
In the ladies' room, I would appreciate seat protector liners and a small mirror.
Or at least a mirror in the hallway.
My husband did say that the men's bathroom had a cool urinal!
There is an additional room being finished up.
It's a dark and has a world cool ambiance.
The manager said it would be an izakaya room.
Thanks!
On a side note: When I typed in "Hiro" intoYyelp it did not find this restaurant.
I had to type the entire Hiromaru name.
Poor coding on Yelp's part.

New Ramen place!!
We tried Curry and Karaage, other than Ramen.
For Curry the meat was little too fatty and we asked more rice (they did not charge) They gave green salad and desert as compliments.
A little pricy.

Wow if you come in you gotta try the salad ramen.
This is such a great dish for the hot summer and the service is great too.

After the first time visit, it just wasn't tasty enough.
The menu looked like it was done in a rush just to open the door.
There are only four different choice of noodles.
Everything on the menu is pork.
No other option.
The shiroi ramen flavor was tasteless.
The egg which comes with the ramen was cold in the noodles.
The noodle was a bit undercooked.
The soup just wasn't hot enough.
The staff are nice but seems like they are still in process of training.

Was just driving by on way to Chinatown to eat and saw the sign for ramen so we did a fast u turn and boy are we glad we did.
The service is 5 star and the food is just too good for words the decor shouts japan.
We loved the food and the entire experience the chef needs to be commended for the wonderful food that comes out of his kitchen.
If you love Japanese ramen you must try this wonderful place.

First time here and what a pleasant surprise.
We have had a few ramen places open in Vegas since Monta and all have their minor differences.
Apparently this is Japanese chain with its first restaurant in the US.
Started with the Hiromaru fried rice, a "fluffy" rice dish with pork belly served over two fried eggs.
Really enjoyed this dish.
Then had the Shiroi Tonkatsu ramen.
Unbelievable flavor with a creamer broth and thin noodle.
We had a group of eleven and don't think anyone had anything but raves about their meal.
Service and management was great getting our large group seated and getting our food out quickly.

I really loved the Black Garlic ramen.
The buns were excellent too.
Service was fine.
My biggest negative was the lighting and the heavy chairs.
It was so bright , I thought I was in a dentist office,or Walgreens.
The Decor could be a little warmer.
At least fill in the empty walls a little.
Or a darker paint.
I love Fukumimi & Monta.
This restaurant offers a different and very yummy ramen.
But if I  were to bring my friends from the east coast to try ramen here in Vegas ,i probably would nt take them here because of the brightness.
Yes,it's the food that matters,but I personally would feel way better in a less office lighting setting.
They got the food part down.
The hang is important as well.

We didn't have a horrible experience here but unfavorable enough to not go back.
The counter seating is poorly spaced, you can really move your legs or turn.
I had to ask 4 times for our drinks which came finally after our food.
The ramen was ok- the pork belly buns were confusing.
The sauce in the meat was good- but it wasn't meat in one of them it was all gristle.
Top that with a blob of mayo and a piece of lettuce...is that the fusion part?
For less we could have gotten a much better experience at lots if other places.

A ramen spot that didn't quite hit the spot.. We are a interesting group of food critics.
What's worse is I fear taking my father places because of his reactions.
I would like to say this place met my expectations but it fell short.
They are still working on there opening and feel that it could be much better but first impressions are everything.
Service was great, I can't complain it's a really nice looking plAce and I'm looking forward to the izakaya side!
They have good pork buns and fresh Gyoza: the pork was a good size, the buns were nice and soft, not to hot ( temperature wise) but over all good.
The Gyoza was thin, lite and fresh tasting ( we ordered 2 orders).
My Ramen was not so hot, it was I wanted or expected?
It's a strange type of ramen?
Which is not something that I ate before with Ramen?
Or had a type of ramen that was more cream than soup?
Oh we'll..
It was worth a try..

I've been to Ramen spots here,  Hawaii,  and Seattle, and this is very unique and delicious.
They are very attentive to details,  perfect textures and seasonings.
And this is just the first bowl.
I'm excited to try everything!

Very, very happy with the service and staff.
As soon as I walked in I was greeted by what I assume was the owner and one of his staff.
Both were genuinely happy to have me in their restaurant.
In the grander terms of Las Vegas this kind of service can be hard to find.
The white on red interior along with open kitchen leave little room for any poor maintenance and sloppy upkeep.
Clean and crisp is a nice change from neighboring competitors.
In Las Vegas' s edition of China Town.
The menu is a very normal size for a ramen restaurant but has a nice spin in ingredients.
So if you like ramen in a clean restaurant (who doesn't), with great service, a pleasant staff and what appears to be some fine food coming with the superior service this is your place.
Thanks to the staff who made a long day with a four and a six year old have a pleasant ending.

Hiramaro VS Monta:  -The broths are flavored differently, creating a different product for each restaurant.
-Pro for Hiramaru: SERVICE!
I find that Monta no longer takes the time to take care it's customers properly.
Their service is not poor but it's not genuine.
Hiramaru provides a great dining experience highly due to the service it provides!
-Another Pro: the temperature of the broth for Hiramaru allows me to enjoy the ramen right when I receive it.
I find that my tongue doesn't burn and I can taste the flavors throughout the meal.
With Monta's temperature, I can't really taste the broth after eating for about 10 minutes because it's just too hot .
However, ramen is just plain good, both at Hiramaru and Monta, so I shall eat it no matter what!!!
-Lastly: Hiramaru provides a bigger menu and therefore has a greater selection of items to grub on!
Their prices are a tad bit more expensive.
I love the food they offer for their customers but I also love the simplicity of Monta's menu.
Overall, Hiramaru is good and worthy!
Haha.
It's new and still deserves to learn and grow, just like any new restaurant.
Monta can continue striving for greatest through improvement of service.

05/04/14 DINNER  So I write my first Yelp in quite a long time, mostly due to time constraints.
(Sheesh, should I even bother, my LAST Yelp review generated my first-ever hate mail, via Yelp's "compliment" app!
NICE!
)  I'm not gonna get into it deeply (actually, knowing me, I probably will!
), but we REALLY liked this place a lot.
It's the first of this Japanese chain's restaurants in the entire United States.
Having dined there, we feel privileged.
And dining here was a last-minute decision.
We were on our way elsewhere for a dear friend's Cinco de Mayo bar extravaganza, but unfortunately their parking lot was completely full from the very beginning, and with absolutely NO street parking for miles, we gave up on that.
(Sorry, C!
Love you, man!
)  It's not fair to review the standard ramen itself here, as we didn't have typical ramen, but we want to return and try that, to compare it to the other ramen places we've tried in Vegas.
(HINT: My absolute FAVE ramen place remains Ramen Sora, particularly the miso ramen, but we haven't been there in quite a while.
)  First off, you can order an Asahi draft for under $4, or you can order the same beer with edamame thrown in for the same price!
We opted for that little extra.
The edamame were OK, nothing special, no garlic or coarse salt.
But for free, who can complain!
As all 3 of us wanted a beer, we got lots of edamame.
Next up, if you check-in via Yelp you can get purchase an appetizer for half off.
As we had a party of 3 (but only 2 smartphones), we opted for the karaage and the gyoza.
The karaage (Japanese boneless fried chicken) are the reason this place didn't get 5 stars from me: very disappointing.
It's like they threw purchased frozen nuggets in a fryer.
Not the worst thing in the world, but greasy, not crispy, never again.
BUT THOSE GYOZA!
WOW!
We could've ordered tons of those!
Wonderful!
Lastly, my spouse and I ordered the same entree, the carbonara ramen.
I guess this is the signature dish of the chain.
It's literally a lightly japanese take on carbonara pasta in Italy.
This rocked.
Not a heavy cream sauce, as most american restaurants mistakenly do, but a light broth (using the same broth in the ramens) with cream added.
The waitress asked if I wanted thick or thin noodles, I opted to have her choose, she chose thick, and they were great with this.
Now, this dish is NOT loaded up with pork belly slices, like other ramens I've had in the past, but instead contains some chopped up pork belly and fat, which was similar to the pancetta you'd get if ordered in Italy.
At $10.95, this was a great deal and, like I said, was terrific.
Best carbonara I've had ANYWHERE in quite a long time.
(Oh, how I long for the day of the visiting barely-english-speaking Claudio and his home made pasta & carbonara, made at my apt in Sherman Oaks, CA!
)  The check was cheap, under $20 pp including tax and tip.
Needless to say, we'll be back.

I got the black garlic sauce ramen and carbonara.
The black garlic was awesome!!
perfect taste!
the carbonara taste like pasta but with ramen noodle and extra sauce.
I like the black garlic better and I would be back for this!
Dont forget to check in to get 50% off for gyoza and karage!

First time here not first time with ramen.
The sticky buns are amazing everyone should order that for an app when you go.
I ordered the shiroi tonkatsu (sp) sorry lol.
It was very good, nice and spicy which I asked for.
The chasu was better here than any of the other ramen houses I've been to.
The broth was creamy and noodles thin for my order.
Decor was modern and fit the "fusion" description perfectly to me.
Service was attentive and friendly.
Would go back but not a must.

Came here to try out the much-hyped Carbonara ramen.
Why go to a fusion ramen place if you don't try the fusion dishes, right?
Interior is surprisingly modern, despite the more traditional exterior.
Service was polite- we sat in the right-hand side with red and white decor, there was a couple in the more intimate left-hand side, not sure what the difference is to get seated there.
Started with the Hiromaru buns as an appetizer- quite nice, with doughy buns and plentiful portions of pork and special sauce.
I quite liked the almost barbecue-like sauce that the pork was cooked in.
Carbonara ramen for myself, black garlic for my guy.
I was pleasantly surprised by my dish- was a little apprehensive, thinking the broth would be thicker and create a texture I did not like (not a fan of alfredo sauces) but somehow it worked, being milky and flavorful without being too decadent or overly rich (though it was).
Did not specify thick noodles as I initially would have preferred, but received thin and appreciated the similarity to spaghetti carbonara, added to the fusion feel of the dish overall.
The bacon and fresh-ground pepper really made this dish, adding just a bit of bite to the flavor and a meaty savory element that balanced out the milky broth.
And I'm not even a bacon fan!
My guy favored his garlic ramen- I took a few bites and it wasn't really for me, flavors were bold but seemed a little off.
He has had less ramen but proclaimed that it was his favorite bowl so far, which is impressive.
Egg was a bit overcooked, but overall the dish was tasty but just slightly off and almost felt incomplete, like something was missing.
I will say that, despite the giant bowls and the rich broths, the ramen did not feel like an overwhelmingly heavy dinner- perhaps it has to do with the choice for thin noodles?
A big bowl of ramen is good comfort food to me, but I liked not feeling the sloshing-belly-full-of-dinner feeling afterward.
Would come back to try the other milk-broth ramen with ham.

I really was expecting this place to be great.
They really fall short of the "Ramen" part.
The noodles tasted like pasta and the soup was more italian.
If you love traditional Ramen, your better off waiting in line at Monta.
Oh and if you get the seafood ramen here, its just an added powder, no actual seafood is used.
They are too pricey for what you get.

Short: Good ramen, might be a nice change of pace, interesting environment.
There's better ramen shops in the area, but this one is a bit unique.
Long: Came here with a friend after spotting it on my drive home from Monta Ramen.
Looks rather odd from the outside, but inside is rather interesting.
Kinda?
It looks rather "modern" on the inside, and it feels a bit uncomfortable to me.
I ordered the Shiro Tonkotsu ramen just to set a standard to review this place from.
It's the typical tonkotsu ramen with milk added.
The noodles, toppings, and broth was pretty close to Monta ramen's, but the chashu was a bit firmer which made it more flavorful, but the broth mix wasn't as strong as Monta ramen's.
Service was alright, can't complain there.
Go here if you want to try something different--other than the tonkotsu, miso, shoryu you can get else where (there is other unique ramen spots though!).
Go if something intrigues you on the menu, but as it sits with the "unique" spins, it's not as good as more traditional places.
I'd choose Monta over this place 9/10 times.

Loving it here.. Service is superb, food is heavenly, serving size is plentiful and the ambience is invitingly modern!
Just ordered the Shiroi Tonkotsu Ramen $7.95, Fried Ramen $8.95 and Gyoza $5 bucks for a serving of 6.
Lucky me!
Just redeemed my 50% off discount for the gyoza...just for checking in!!!
This will be my Ramen spot for sick days.

Yikes!!
I started my dinner off with the Bao buns which had a sauce overload..
It was messy to eat and took away from the pork belly.
The curry bowl was boring and so was side salad that comes with it.
The chicken karaage lacked some flavor but it wasn't too bad.
On to the ramen!!!
The kuro had ZERO garlic flavor anywhere.
Not even a slight aroma of it.
There is nothing more exciting to me than the aroma of my meal in front of me.
The tonkatsu was very weird and was VERY short of amazing.. Kind of let me down and made me wish I had went to Monta or Sora instead.
(Which I had to do two days later because I needed my fix after the disappointment)   I mentioned that I did not like the kuro and they were kind of enough to remove it from my bill.
Sorry, but I won't be returning.

I had the Japanese Curry with pork  and the sauce was delicious!It tasted like a thick broth that would work best to bake a pork roast with.
However, there was a small portion of rice and the rest of the plate was all sauce!!!
I should have ordered the ramen, but I wanted to try a different type of curry .
I would definetely come back again for the ambiance.
The place newly opened and the lounge was still being built, but we had a chance to sit there since we were such a large group.
I look forward to coming back when the lounge is finished.

1st time eating here.
Food was on point.
Ordered the Fried Ramen Noodles.
So fresh.
Will def be back to try other menu items.
Cool vibe and great service.

The management or owner is descendant of the Toyotomi Clan.
Goood ramen and simple menu but awesome!

Good ramen is a worthy obsession.
Great ramen?...nearly orgasmic!
Poor ramen?...scorns the taste buds--mercilessly ridiculing your incompetent decision.
I started this review thinking Hiromaru Fusion Ramen was a 2.5 or 3 star experience...as I wrote and recalled my experience, I ended  up feeling like I couldn't justify anything beyond 2 stars.
I wasn't really a fan all the way around.
There are two distinct dinning areas.
One is bright and clean...lots of white...bright lights... accented with strong, vibrant red and some natural wood.
Did I mention this side is bright?
Well, it is...pretty sure surgeons prefer less light during intricate operations.
The other side is calm and peacefully brought together with muted browns, blues and the like.
The lighting on this side pushes towards a romantic feel and I would certainly try to sit on this side if I return.
We tried the Shiroi Tonkotsu (Salted White Tonkotsu) $7.95 and the signature-fusion Carbonara Ramen $10.95.
Neither ramen left us wanting more.
A few distinct changes have taken place based on some early comments.
Both noodles were thin, eggs were executed well.
Previous reviewers have complained about the thick noodles.
I didn't have those...I will go ahead and complain about the thin noodles instead.
I like a bit more bite.
There isn't much tooth found in these overly thin noodles.
The Shiroi had a nice flavor on the front, but lingered in a way that I didn't enjoy.
...wasn't even a fan of the thin pork in this ramen, so while I could put a whole bowl of this down, I won't be seeking it out anytime soon.
The Carbonara excited me even less.
I didn't like the flavors or the texture of the broth.
The noodles were the same as described previously, only this time there was nothing redeeming for me in this bowl.
I didn't have the opportunity to try any of the side dishes, but probably won't (unless I hear that they are something special) since I won't be back for the ramen.

I came here with my family a few weeks ago and my sister absolutely loves the Japanese feel and the carbonara ramen is her favorite!
I personally like the gyoza which is nice and crispy and the special fried rice :)

Based on my one visit, I cant say I'm a fan of this place.
The Kuroi tonkotsu ($8.95) was an odd mix of tonkotsu ramen and black garlic with flavors fighting each other for your attention.
The thin noodles were dense and somewhat gummy.
It's a place to try for the shear novelty factor of the unique types of ramen served, but I think I prefer a more traditional type of ramen.
If you sit at the counter prepare to bang your knees into the ledge beneath the counter.
If you try to scoot in -- and those seat are heavy and hard to move -- there's a high chance of you hitting your knees more than once.

The boyfriend and I finally got around to checking this place out, and while it's not the best, we'll probably visit again.
'  I'm not a huge fan of the modern red and white décor; the seats looked more like ottomans, and the place was a bit overly bright.
The seats were pretty comfortable though.
They had the door open, and the AC was not on.
I didn't find it to be too hot, just warm, but the boyfriend found the place way too warm considering that they're serving hot soup.
Service was quick and attentive.
We didn't have to  wait to be seated, water was refilled promptly, and the waitress checked on us several times.
We didn't have any questions about the food, but she seemed knowledgeable when answering the questions of another party.
As an appetizer, we ordered the Karaage, which I thought was a somewhat small portion considering the price, $5.
The boyfriend thought the portion was fine, so maybe I'm just cheap.
:P At any rate, it was tender and juicy.
Ramen, though, was only ok. Shiroi Tonkatsu was kind of bland, to be honest.
And the boyfriend got Tate-Yama, which he simply described as "Bean Sprout Mountain".

From a Restaurant Consultants Perspective  As most ramen diners know, Las Vegas is becoming pretty saturated with ramen restaurants.
This is true with Spring Mountain Road, as there's Sora Ramen and Monta just up the street.
Then, Hiromaru Fusion ramen opens a few months ago.
It's important that when you are going to Hiromaru, that you understand that it is a "fusion" restaurant, not a typical Japanese ramen restaurant.
The location is very good, centrally located on the end-cap in the center.
One feature that I did not personally like was the "hyper-lighting" that was installed with the contemporary design.
You almost need sunglasses to enter, especially when you are entering in the evening.
But, the design elements are excellent, with colors of vanilla and Asian red.
There definitely was no short cuts taken with Hiromaru,  Unlike the disappointing design with Monta, you will be pleasantly surprised at the attention to detail at Hiromaru.
The food and service were fine, especially for a restaurant that is so young in terms of age.
The ramen was good, as well as the service.
Their price points were excellent.
The important thing to always remember with any restaurant is this question:  Would you return for the food?
Our answer would be yes, especially since you have pretty good features already, which include good food, service and atmosphere.
The restaurant manager was nice enough to come by our table.
I explained to him the lighting issue and contemporary ottoman style seating.
The manager listened intently and took mental notes.
For the lighting issue, he explained that they were going to switch to the Japanese style lighting, which incorporates rice paper shades.
The ottoman style seating is a bit difficult to move, especially for younger people or women wearing dresses.
There are no back rests to these chairs and you are left struggling with how to move them.
The manager quickly noted that they were looking into "sliders", which would be placed under each leg that would make sliding the chairs much easier.
Ultimately, Hiromaru ramen will be successful.
They have an excellent opportunity to be a player in the ramen market in Las Vegas.
The important thing is that they are willing to listen to their diners, which can't be said about too many Japanese restaurants!
Hopefully, they'll have the lighting and seating issue resolved for our next visit.
In the meantime, keep in mind when you first enter that this will not be typical of most ramen houses, and that you'll be in a very contemporary one as well.
As long as you understand these issues, you'll have a really good experience!

Not bad.
We had better when we were visiting D.C.
Walked in to Spanish music playing which cracks me up but whatever.
Prices aren't bad at all.
Will continue to look for a better place.

Maybe the best kaarage in town.
The fusion style ramen isn't typical but good.
The Gyoza is great too.
The fried rice is a bit different but worth a try as well.

I've been wanting to try Hiromaru since they opened because I found that their fusion ramen creations are pretty interesting.
Seeing the Carbonara Ramen pics on yelp really had me curious.
And that's exactly what I ordered.
Carbonara Ramen --  http://bit.ly/1p02mx5 I'm probably one of the few minority that actually enjoyed their Carbonara Ramen.
It's like a breakfast ramen!
Crispy Bacon and Egg.
The bacon gave the Ramen a very nice smoked flavor.
Though my visit was pretty short and that I only had one of their Ramen bowls, I'd say Hiromaru is a decent place and I like how they have a different approach to Ramen with their fusion creations.
If I'm around the area again, I'd probably go back to try their other Ramen bowls.

I would have given this place 5 stars because I enjoyed the ramen but I found dust in the water, I'm assuming because they just leave their cups out on the table for who knows how long.
I asked the waitress for another cup of water because there were obvious dust particles floating inside.
She was pretty annoyed about it so I didn't bother asking her to change my cup.
I got the gyoza and shiroi tonkatsu and may I say, the gyoza is the best I've tasted.
They also have a 50% off of gyoza if you check in.

I ordered the mentai mayo ramen and it was fantastic!
The broth is full of massago and gives the creamy milky broth an appealing flavor.
The waitress had described the ramen as being slightly fishy, I would disagree it was quite an enjoyable meal.
Checking in here has its perks on top of the satisfying food.

It's a nice place but it's too bright.
The portions are very small for it's price.
We did check in and got 50% on the gyoza.
The ramen was okay.
The soup had a weird taste to it.
They gave us options of having it mild, spicy, or spicy spicy.
The chashu bowl was small for it's price.
The taste wasn't bad until I got to the bottom and it got oily.

We first came to this place as an alternative to Monta Ramen.
We ordered the kuroi ramen with garlic oil and the shiroi ramen.
The chashu pork belly was tough but the broths were rich and creamy.
I like how they included egg.
The shiroi broth was a bit too salty for my taste.
Overall, the ramen was okay.
The service was efficient but seemed unenthusiastic.
We didn't even get a greeting at the door.
It's worth giving another try in the future.

Not your typical ramen place.
It is a nice change.
They have various fusion ramen and also a izakaya menu at night time.
The shrimp ramen is really good.
The decor is nice and modern inside.

I ordered the gyoza and ramen with black garlic oil.
Gyoza was crispy near the edges and a lot softer in the center.
I loved the texture of the gyoza towards the edges but the center was a bit too soft and soggy compared to other gyozas.
The ramen noodles were hard which were a nice texture for the soup.
The soup base was tasty, but a bit too much flavor and oiliness that it almost seemed to overcome the overall ramen.
Towards the end, the oil was just too much that I couldn't drink the soup.
I think overall the ramen was good, but I think the restaurant tried too hard to make the ramen taste good that the oiliness and extra flavors mixed in took away from my general first impression.

First time tried the Izakaya for tapas, but really disappointed that takoyaki still frozen inside, raw edamame, slow service and very unattentive Japanese waitress.
Never come back again.

Ramen is good not your typical ramen but very tasty.
The decor reminded me of "A Clockwork Orange" which is cool but the seats with no backing got old quick.
