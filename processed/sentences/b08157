Did an amazing job creating a gorgeous bouquet for our wedding on super short notice, they were able to design something more beautiful than I could have ever imagined and kept it within my budget.
I got so many compliments on my bouquet!

We ordered flowers from here for mom's 90th bday party, based on reviews and near the location I needed them.
The flowers were very beautiful.
I'm not from the area so it was a chance.
I was completely satisfied.
The gentleman that waited on me was very nice and accommodating.
I will order from them the next time I need flowers sent.

Went in to talk about what we wanted exactly for my wedding flowers.
The lady we met with was no help whatsoever.
We had a few ideas but she looked at us like we were dumb for what we were wanting.
We left more confused than when we went in.. She said she would email us prices for the flowers we were wanting.
Never heard from them.
