I was really surprised by the hair cut I got here.
The salon was really clean,open and the dresser was very friendly.
It was a little pricey, but I got a really great cut and blow out.
Return factor?
Yep!

Only place I go and have gone to for over 3 years.
Anyone you ask in there knows who I am and that I come in weekly.
Love it!!
I would tell you who I see, but that might make me getting an appointment harder!!
HAHA
