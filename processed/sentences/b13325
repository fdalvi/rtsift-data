Staff is extremely nice (especially John).
As a female, I didn't feel like I was being taken advantage of, which I get skeptical of the chain auto places.
I had gone in for an oil change and to have my brakes checked out but found out all of my tires had to be replaced.
They showed me the interior of my tires and pointed out the reasons and gave me options of brands to choose from.
When I came in to get them replaced, they said they had been worried about me driving on them and took my car right in.
I would definitely recommend them.

I have been to this shop several times having my car repaired over the last couple of years, and have NEVER had a problem with any of the work performed.
Every single time that I have been in, they have diagnosed, ordered parts for, and repaired my car in a timely manner.
Prices are VERY reasonable in comparison to other shops around town.
This is a "mom and pop" shop with a staff that is very knowledgeable in the repair field.
I wouldn't take my car anywhere else to be repaired.
The owner, John, is super friendly, listens to what your problem is and makes sure that everything is repaired the first time through.
I have had such services as A/C compressor replacement, emissions system work, water pump replacement as well as general maintenance.
Don't trust your car to just anyone, make the drive to Glendale Repairs and you won't be disappointed.

John did my oil change and his wife kept me entertained with great conversation.
I would gladly recommend for any auto repair.
will do business again!
