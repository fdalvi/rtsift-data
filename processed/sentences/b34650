Might be the cheapest / best retail store to pick up a new iPhone5 case this side of the Pacific.
$9 for a clear rubber case (my phone is white) and a rainbow of other colors.
They also have bumper-styles for $11-ish.
Yes, you can order one on Amazon, but at least here you can see how the cases look / fit in person.
A ton of iPhone4 cases, too, even cheaper.
Noticed a wall full of knock-off Toms (shoes) for under $20 if you're into that kind of thing!

No more phone case mecca here :( Too bad!

So much potential here!
Lots of space here.
Someone hurry and rent some space, you got potential for growth!
Theres a business in there that ships packages that I have never heard of the company.
Wonder how much they charge.
One thing for sure I loved the store in the corner with all the Chinese merchandize.
I will visit here again and take pics!
