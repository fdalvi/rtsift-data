Good food, good service...FAST!

One of my favorite choices.
What can beat five bucks for a pizza ready to go when you walk in?
The cheesy bread and wings are a solid choice too.
Not to long ago my wife was having a rough day.
I wanted to surprise her when I came home from work.
I stopped by little Caesars, picked up a pizza, then picked up a movie and spent the night cuddling with her on the couch.

Prompt service.
They *smile* too.
Can't beat a $5 pizza on the go.
I'm grateful their pizza doesn't drip fatty oil like a Papa John's pizza.
The Italian cheesy bread is addictive.
Carry out only.
The Italian cheesy bread could come down in price *just a tad*.
They were experimenting with these new flavors for chicken wings.
We tried the lemon pepper flavor and the wings were a bit on the cold side.
Also very bland for the picture they put up on their menu.
They look better than what they actually taste.
