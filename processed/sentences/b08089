Rude and obnoxious people work here!
I will never go to this store again.
ESP when they are not even familiar with their products and are more interested with chit chatting with one another than helping customers.
I felt unwelcomed entering the store and very uncomfortable.
It's a shame because I always enjoyed shopping at the Body Shop in the past & love their products.
Oh well at least I can order online

I had the best experience here!
I was immediately greeted by an employee.
She was very nice and helped me match foundation to my skin type.
She was very helpful when I had any questions.
She also let me know that I received $10 off any item in your birthday month.
My luck!

I was so disappointed with my visit to this store tonight .
When I walked into the store, there were three employees all standing behind the cash registers talking and talking and talking.
Only one other customer was in the store.
I was in the store for at least 20 minutes and did not receive a single acknowledgment.
The three employees remained behind the registers.
I heard one employee identify herself as Debbie.
Terrible customer service, employees obviously need more training.
I don't plan on returning.
I'd rather go to Origins - I've always received fantastic service and friendly employees in their shop.
