I went to see Pam after a car accident where I had gotten pretty banged up and Pam was able to relieve a lot of my back and neck pain.
I've been fortunate enough to have Pam work on my back a couple of times and it is so relaxing and helps tremendously with any pain I am having.
Pam is very professional and makes you feel at ease while she is working on you.
Pam has a lot to offer besides just massage work.
She does Therapeutic Touch, Cranial Sacral, and Angel Intuitive Readings.
I love Pam and I'm sure you will too.

In April I was referred to Pam Sears for a massage by a friend.
I have had massages at several different spas and also the School for Massage and thought ok, I'll see what she can do.
I was very glad I made the appointment!
I work on a computer and have a lot of neck tension.
I don't like a deep tissue massage but I like some pressure and Pam was awesome!
I always feel wonderful after her massage!
(Yes, I return each month now.
)  She worked on providing exactly what I asked for and I have the benefit of being able to buy Pea Protein powder and essential oils at the center!
I highly recommend her for any service she provides!
Thank you Pam!

I love how intuitive Pam Sears is?!?!
Not only is she caring and compassionate she seems to know exactly what and where my body needs work!
I always combine her massage therapy session with the BioMat far infrared heat therapy as its like getting a two hour massage for the price of one AND it eliminates all soreness and detoxing that would otherwise occur for me!
