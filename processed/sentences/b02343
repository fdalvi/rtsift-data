New selection of cigars and craft beers this place is doing pick any 6 craft beers for a special price and have a great selection to choose from

Best smoke shop in Mesa AZ area that I've done business with so far!
Hands down.
Its not anything "special"; its best product, best (honest) customer service & consistently.
I've covered smoke shops in areas from val vista & Southern, broadway & Lindsay to alma school & Guadalupe.

My first visit was great, found this store had almost all of my favorite cigars in stock.
Friendly service.
However, I found out a day later that I had been overcharged.
I went back to the store and showed the clerk what I had bought and what I had been charged.
He immediately started to give me back the change that I was due.
I stopped him and asked if I could just grab some more cigars instead and has said absolutely!!
So, I will be going back and highly recommend this store.
The staff is knowledgeable and friendly and the prices are very reasonable.
5 Star recommendation!
