I had the chance to try their bubble tea and specialty drinks over the last couple weeks while they still had their buy one get one free offer (the flyers for which they were illegally handing out in various places).
The first cups of mango diamond that I got when they first opened were fantastic.
Many chunks of diced mangoes in a mixture that's has more taste than most smoothies I've had.
Their prices are also very low compared to many bbt places in Waterloo/Ontario.
The staff are friendly and kind.
The restaurant is clean and newly decorated.
However, subsequent cups of mango diamond weren't as good as the first and I wonder if I'll be going back again.

Heard about this place when it first opened through a coupon book we got in the mail, after one visit we quickly became regulars.
MANY choices, kind staff and clean please to relax with friends.
Wait times can get a little long when it's busy but that's to be expected.
Can't wait for my next visit :)
