omg amazing place!
definately try a green-sauce enchilada with cheese, the rice and beans are amazing and salsa reminds me of the authentic places in San Diego...tiny hole in the wall though, so keep an eye out for it...if you exit the 1-10 at 32nd, head south about two blocks, make a left (east) on broadway, its right after 36th street in an industrial area....if you see Napa Auto parts across the way, you found it!
:-) they will literally make you ANYTHING you want (within reasonable terms of course!
) and they have a good kids menu for the little ones

Great great great.
My coworker and I had literally hours to kill waiting on a flight out of PHX and through the miracle of the Yelp iPhone app and some assistance from google maps and one good review we ended up ag Salsa y Sombreros fit a lunch a million times better than anything HMS Host would have served up at the airport.
Yum.
We both had the special - mini tacos with rice and beans and they were awese.
Authentic Mexican tacos cooked with love from a true mom and pop operation.
And I mean literally - mom and pop were cooking and their don was taking orders.
Loved the food, loved the friendly service and especially loved the salsa bar with delicious fresh salsa.
If you ever need to kill time and eat lunch near PHX head on over.
Well worth it.
Thanks Yelp.
