Nice hotel in great locaion for visitors to Edinburgh , part of Best Western Hotel Group.
Has a lovely restaurant downstairs and got to admit the food we had was excellent as well as the service from the staff.
Ok for families to go eating as well , on busy bus route ino Edinburgh or about Â£5 for a taxi.

It is not often that I am rendered speechless (ask my mum) but walking into the Bruntsfield Bistro, the restaurant of the Bruntsfield Hotel, I was indeed, speechless.
The decor was so chic and on-trend I was literally flabbergasted.
And it's not often I use that word, as I'm sure it's not often you hear it.
Getting past the initial shock, the menu selection was great.
My first visit was for a brunch (a particularly good time to visit the bistro) and was pleasantly surprised by their contemporary selections.
The main meals are good too, not the best but still very good.
I had duck and found it a bitty tough, but I didn't mind too much.
The surroundings made up for what lacked in the food.
Indeed, I felt thoroughly cool sitting there, despite the fact that nobody other than other diners could appreciate it.
Definitely worth a visit - Sunday brunch in particular.
