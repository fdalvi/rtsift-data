My grandparents always go here when I visit.
It's a small family owned business, nothing to write home about.
I've never been there for breakfast, but their lunch/dinner entrees are typical family owned diner fare.
Their sloppy joes are above average if you're into that sort of thing, and I had a pretty good bacon cheeseburger (the patty was cooked well-done as I had ordered, and the bacon was thick).
The one thing about this place is the repertoire they seem to have built with their customers.
They know my grandpa, and always seem to know many of their other customers when I'm there.
This is in a retirement community, and I always feel so young in there :)

Not edible.

Friday AYCE Fish Fry was good.
U have a choice of baked or fried cod, soup or salad, & fries or baked/mashed potato's.
All was very good!
