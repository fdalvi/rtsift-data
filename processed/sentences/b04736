This time around in AZ I made my second trip to this Bar.
Enough TV's and enough sports to keep everyone happy.
I dug this spot because as well as offering sports in the bar area they have a nice little lounge with sofas and big screen's to enjoy the weekend games.
Along with these little comforts you can also get a pool table and the tables aren't in the middle of the mix so they don't get in the way of the people there just to drink and enjoy the games.
Funny story i was greeted by the AZ PD as I left the build and after 5min of trying to convince me to a take a sobriety test it was a good night.
Being from LA I found it hard that police would give you a sobriety test for fun.
I had to make it clear I wasn't driving and I knew I was drunk they explained they offered this as a service so people would understand that they may leave a bar thinking there good to drive but if they were to be pulled over what their alcohol content would actually read.
So after I blew a .13 I felt I had to remind them that I wasn't driving.
They laughed and sent me on my way with my DD.
Good times.
The police get one star.

Great service and good food.
Wonderful staff there.

Good service, low prices for happy hour, good bar food

This place is pretty cool!
Plenty of TVs to watch the games and they also do breakfast over the NFL season which is darn good.
Great selection on beers and the menu is great especially for appetizers.
I'm a fan of the pretzels.
They also got plenty of pool tables to enjoy!
This place is just fun to be at during the games with really good service and cold beers.
