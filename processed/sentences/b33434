Located inside Central Christian Church, you can get your Starbucks fix as well as various Christian books and music, kinda like a condensed version of Barnes and Noble.
The "242" comes from the book of Acts (Acts 2:42) according to one worker.
Goes perfectly with the amazing, upifting services here at Central....Happy Birthday Jesus!
ALOHA!!!!
YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(133/365) "Starbucks' Cousin"

Starbucks products at church for a yummy service!
I like the fact that everyone who works there does it for free and all of the profits go directly to the church.
Love!

I love my church!
Where else can you find a starbucks shop inside a church?
Why the name Two42?
It's derived from the Bible.. Acts 2:42 " All the believers devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching, and to fellowship, and to sharing in meals and to prayer.
"  Perfect place to meet other people for fellowship before service.

I like to order a coffee and grab a book to read when I visit on Friday nights.
While I don't attend church at Central, I have found the people and staff I have encountered to be incredibly nice and welcoming.
The coffee is good too!

Ordered two bagels, a blueberry muffin, 2 fresh ice teas, and a frappacino.
All great!
Makes for a nice meeting spot before the busy service.
Only suggestion-- a nice young lady tries to assist the long line by taking orders before you reach the counter, which actually seems to clog up the line and/or lead to further confusion.
Good seection of books in the bookstore.
