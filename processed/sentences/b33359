I got my eyelash extensions at ilashcandy and they are great.
I recommend them to everyone.
They also do hair extensions and I will be checking that out soon.

Did a so so job.
Expensive for the clumpy lashes I got.
I've had far better lashes since.

By far was the worst experience, my individual lashes were put on completely crooked and some up side down, I had to try a new salon for a fill because my usual technician was out of town.
I had to have them completely removed as soon as I looked in the mirror because my lashes looked like I've slept on my face all night.
Wasted 2 hours of my time and completely messed up my eyes.
