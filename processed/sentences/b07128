Good service!!
My daughter ordered the wrong pizza.
When I went to pick up the pizza they made the correct order in 10 min and they gave me both for price of the one.

Not a fan.
As far as pizza goes there are a bunch of options in Verona, especially south side, and the pizza hut is mediocre and overpriced.
It's not horrible, but I only order from here when I'm too drunk to care about quality.
Everything you eat from here leaves a greasy film in your mouth.
Like I said, when I do order from here it's because I don't care about the quality, I just want to eat.

I ordered a regular pepperoni pizza from this store and when it was delivered to my house, I opened it and there was no cheese on the pizza except for on two slices.
We called and the first girl that I talked to was understanding and said can I have you talk to the manager and explain this to him because this is not the first complaint about this.
When we talked to the manager his response was well next time order one with extra cheese.
So this means that if I want any cheese I have to order it??
Wtf.., not good service at all.
I am a very I satisfied customer

I have ordered from here multiple times and the order is either late and cold or just not even ready for pick up when I show up.
The first time they were running an hour behind which left my delivery at now 2 hrs....the manager said "I don't know what to tell you....its on its way" did not even offer a discount.
If there were any other pizza joints around here I would choose them over this pizza hut!
Service here is HORRIBLE!
