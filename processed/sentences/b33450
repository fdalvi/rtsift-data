Great customer service

Great customer service!
Ask for Juan.

Oh what fresh hell is this?
It's Verizon and good luck trying to get ANYTHING done at this store.
The wait is actually longer than the DMV.
Associates are nice, but seriously, there are no words for how long this wait is.
I was number 2, have been for awhile, then I was number 3 for a bit, now back at number 2.
End of contract can't come fast enough.
Ugh.

Logan was exceptional in customer service!
He tailored everything to our specific needs.
He mentioned ways we could save money on our plan.
He went out of his way to make sure we got exactly what we came in for.
Best wireless experience ever.
I will continue to do all Verizon business with him at this location.
