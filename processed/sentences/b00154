I've gotten my hair done here a few times and I've found that I really like the place.
It's an aveda salon and it has very reasonable prices for cuts and colors.
The gal who did my hair during my first two visits had her baby the day before my most recent visit, so I had a different newer gal.
She did a great job on cutting my hair and giving it back some shape.
She had nearly finished the cut when I mentioned that I would be willing to go a bit shorter.
She was happy to do that even though it made her have to practically start over.

Pricey and bad quality service.
I immediately had to re-do my hair upon leaving and did a much better job myself with products from Sallys.
(and for less than half of what I was charged..)  Bottom line:  Dont waste your money or time at this salon.

I created a yelp account to write this review.
I came in for a trim that I had scheduled the day before.
Only one stylist working and no receptionist.
After waiting for her to finish up with her client the stylist informed me I had no appointment.
She checked the computer we found my name written under the wrong day and time.
She was not very apologetic for my inconvenience and nothing was offered to me to insure my return.
I will advise my friends and family not to visit this salon.

I saw Bonnie at DBTB several times before I left Madison.
For me, it was the best balance of quality and cost that I found after trying half a dozen different stylists while in school.
The staff is super friendly and really put me at ease (I can be shy and dread too-chatty stylists) and I was always satisfied with the result.
Maybe not blown away, like if you're looking for something really edgy this might not be the place for you, but I'm picky and have difficult hair and Bonnie gave me exactly what I was looking for.
I also got it colored once by her, too; just an all-over so I guess it's hard to mess that up, but I had no complaints!
If I hadn't moved I'd still be going!

pricey for what you get (average cut, average color), the place is cramped otherwise nicely decorated but the mold smell from the basement sometimes gets horrendous.
Wish they would clean this up, the owner doesn't seem to care.
