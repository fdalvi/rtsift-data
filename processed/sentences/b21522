Good inexpensive giant burrito.
I had the carnitas very juicy and tasty.
Looks like they have 1.99 breakfast burritos gotta try that next time.

Better than most Taco Del Mar locations.
Not all franchised chains are the same, and the owners here seem to have more pride in their food quality.
Choice of tortillas is a nice way to start the experience, and given that their ingredients are displayed for you (Subway style ordering/preparing) things seem to be quite tidy.
Food quality is above average overall, but significantly better than  other Taco Del Mar locations.
In the past, especially when they first opened, prices were considerably high for this segment of the market.
A simple burrito combo with chips, cheese dip & drink was pretty much killing the $10 bills in my pocket.
However, they cut prices last year and it's better now, but still they're on the high side compared to nearby Rubio's, Dos Amigos, and Baja Fresh.
Major downside is the excessive delays during busy times.
Maybe it's a lack of staff, or maybe it's the fault of the business model whereby each customer slowly picks and chooses each and every ingredient in their burrito.
Either way, the line doesn't move fast when it's busy, and a couple times I've had to just leave because it was obvious that I wouldn't get out of there quickly and/or get a seat in the small location.
Visit in the off-peak hours and you'll be fine.
But how often can you do that if you work for a living and have a busy schedule?
