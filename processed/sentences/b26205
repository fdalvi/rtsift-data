Needless to say, I was a nervous mother of a 4 year old toddler taking him to his first dentist visit.
I'm relieved to say it went better than I imagined!
Dr. Cheever had the utmost patience with my child, even when my son started fussing.
A dentist who doesn't believe in restraining his little customers, just making them feel at ease.
He even suggested that to make future visits less scary for kids, to stop by for a free toothbrush, play with his waiting room toys, then head out, just to make them feel more comfortable going to the office with no exam.
Never thought of that, but I thought it was ingenious, and very clever to offer.
His office was clean, his staff was efficient and friendly.
I would definitely recommend Sunset Pediatric Dentistry for any parents looking for a great dentist for their little ones!

If you need a dentist for a child, this is the place that you need to be.
Both my kids like going there.
Dr. Cheever is a big believer in the idea that kids should not be traumatized by the dentist.
He allows them to run around the office, play with the chairs to see how they work, and the uses good verbal and nonverbal techniques.
Son had to have a tooth pulled and doesn't have any issues in returning.
Daughter had a cavity filled and again no issues.
Daughter sees the health district building (where they give vaccines) and turns around to run away.
Neither kids think that way about the dentist and I am forever grateful.

The best pediatric dentist ever!!!
My kids just love it here!!!
Staff is very professional and kind!!!
Office is very clean and child friendly!!
