Great discounted burning man shopping and beyond.
She's a sweetheart and this a legit small business worthy to support!!

Sexy handmade things!
Lady was South American and very nice!
She has wide selections and most outfits fit well on every body type!
If I ever go out this way again!
I would probably shop here!
Thanks for the hot red bikini!

I'm upset that I have to give this business even 1 star.
My bf and I had gone to eat arepas and seeing that this was the first time we ever saw this store open, decided to stop in.
At first, the owner/mgr lady was great... friendly and helpful.
Then, when I decided to make a purchase (of an item I'm sure I could find much cheaper online), things went south.
I purchased a yelp deal of 50 for 75 and the owner refused to honor it.
She kept saying that yelp did not have a connection with her bank account and that yelp doesn't charge me- that my credit card information is only taken so that a redemption code is provided to me so I can receive the deal.
Mind you, I've purchased yelp deals before and my card has MOST DEFINITELY been charged.
I called my credit card company and had them verbally tell her that it was a purchase I already made and that my card was being charged by yelp.
However, because the charge was in a pending status she still kept arguing that I was not being charged and that she would give me the 50 for 75 deal but I would have to pay the 50 to her, when I had already paid it to Yelp.
Also, throughout the whole time she kept pushing that I had to write a review to get any deal.
Needless to say, I will not be purchasing anything from this business now or ever again and have already contacted yelp about her refusal to honor the deal and getting my money back.
I will give her one thing though, she got her review.
