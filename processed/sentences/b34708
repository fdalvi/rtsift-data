This company was able to work with my in-laws that lived in Northern California and provide them with coverage as if they were in Phoenix.
My mother-in-law, could not have been happier with the speed and efficiency that they worked with.
After replacing 2 windshields for my in-laws I am for sure going to call them if I ever have any issues.
Thanks for keeping me in the good graces with the in-laws!

We received prompt, courteous and efficient service.
What more can one ask for?
I would recommend this to anyone.

Our experience with getting our windshield replaced was great.
I procrastinated and avoided those guys at the car wash saying my windshield was cracked and unsafe.
Finally I called American because I heard I could get a new windshield for free and they would come to my house.
Too good to be true?
It was true.
As a topper their service was good too.
