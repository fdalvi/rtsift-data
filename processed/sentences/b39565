This place is a disgrace to Scotland!
When the Council sold the building a few years ago, it was for its use as a high quality museum of weaving.
That's now a few tatty exhibits shoved into a back corner.
Otherwise it's all just a dreadful shop selling the worst tourist tat rubbish, almost all obviously imported from sweatshops overseas, despite the deceptive labeling, and disgracefully shoddy (and non-authentic).
It's a tragedy that Edinburgh tolerates such a humiliating disgrace in such a prestigious spot right next to the Castle.
If you want a kilt, don't even consider looking here or anywhere else on the high street, unless you want to look a joke in your nylon skirt!!
Shocking.

I was a textile major in college, so I was drawn in by the displays of actual looms.
You have to walk through too many cheesy touristy shops that will convince you that your name has a tartan, even when you're not remotely Scottish.
And everything seems to be covered with a layer of dust and grime (which is not uncommon for actual textile mills).
I did enjoy the attempt to show how the wool is transformed into the tartans, and I did see a few workers down on the older looms actually making something, though I doubt it's anything that gets sold in the store.
They've also got an area where you can have your picture taken in Highland dress, so yeah, it's pretty cheesy all around.
That said, I did find a collection of Harris Tweed patterns that I hadn't seen elsewhere, and I did pick up a Harris Tweed bag that I'm looking forward to using in the cooler weather.
And they'll give you the paperwork to get your tax refund at the desk on the lowest floor.
Sure, it's a tourist trap, but if you can get past that and actual view the looms and such, it can be slightly educational at the same time.
