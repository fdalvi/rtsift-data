Do not use the drive-thru at this location!
They have messed up my order 5 out of 5 times I have used the drive up.
They act like they don't care.
My husbands sandwich toppings end up on mine, mine end up on his and we have never gotten a sandwich made correctly.
Save yourself the annoyance of paying $7 for a sandwich just to get it wrong.

Everything so far has been up to standard.
They offer delivery service which I am too wary to try.
Waay too much opportunity to get things wrong there.
Pretty friendly service every time and this location is open 24/7!!

I looked this subway a lot it has a drive their and they deliver.
The food has been good every time I eat there.

good price, clean location.
