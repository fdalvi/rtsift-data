I found this store almost by accident.
It is a wonderful, wonderful place.
They have a very full inventory of books, DVDs, devotional material and collectibles for the home.
If you find yourself in north Scottsdale, I would make a trip here!

I was looking for some gifts for people who werent exactly the religious type but it was for a death so i felt like i needed something spiritual.
I found this place on yelp and it was gonna be a 30 minute drive.
But the women were so nice on the phone i had to check it out!
And is was DEFINITELY worth the trip!
Devotion is by far the most wonderful Christian store ive ever been to.
It has something for everything.
And a HUGE selection of decorative wall crosses.
(My favorite) Once i found what i wanted the lady even gift wrapped my purchases in boxes with ribbon!
Talk about customer satisfaction.
And prices were great!
I will for sure be returning to devotion.
Oh and ive already been telling everyone I know anout this store.

Devotion is one of my favorite stores in the area.
Very helpful and friendly staff, beautiful store, lots of merchandise to choose from.
I constantly go to buy a single gift...and leave with more.
There has never been a time I made a purchase that I wasn't asked if I would like it complimentary gift wrapped.
What a service!
Would definately recommmend this store.
