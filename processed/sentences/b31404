Shopping for new sheets for our new bed, we found what we were looking for.... 400 thread count sheets under $40??????
SOLD!......ALOHA!!!

There's only one reason I go here.
Pillows.
They have the only side sleeper pillows I've found that don't suck and don't break down after 2 weeks.
If you're into window treatments, a few overpriced towels, and other odds and ends to try and decorate your house like it's getting ready for a magazine shoot this is also your place.
But for me it's all about good pillows.
Life is too short to be miserable from a lack of sleep and Anna's has what I need.
(And no I'm not talking about the down filled pillows that cost $2 more and don't hold up).
Thank you Anna's for helping me to get a good night's sleep and have one less reason to be grumpy.
I can let crappy lunches at Due Forni and Lotus of Siam make me grumpy instead.

I love this store the staff are helpful and kind.
Yes the store is clean and the prices are on point :)

Always been a fan of Anna's (Ha!
That's the name of their loyalty program now!).
I shop here frequently for items to beautify my home.
Over the years, other places have popped up and I will not name them here out of respect, that are seriously beating them in the price category.
For example, I bought two contour pillows from here for $19.99 each and days later, found the exact same pillows (company and all) at another favorite store of mine for $7.99 each!!!
Argh, I was so mad!
Had I have not slept on them already, I would have immediately returned!!
Overall, they have some really nice items in this store.
I have decorated at least 40% of my home with Anna's fashions.
Their quality cannot be beat.
But, and I don't know if it is just me, it appears some of their items are priced higher than I remember.
I am not a cheap-skate in any fashion of the word, but I love a good deal, and this is why I shopped Anna's in the first place.
But lately, I've been finding either the same items or comparable items in other stores for a fraction of their cost.
