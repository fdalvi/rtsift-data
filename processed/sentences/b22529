I really want to leave 4 stars for this place.
It's new.. it seems family run.. the people working there were oh so nice.
I was just disappointed in my sandwich.
They use boar's heads meats and cheeses, but they don't carry any of the more "exotic" delish cheeses like havarti.
Can't fault them for that.
I had a turkey & cheese sandwich on a hero with garlic spread.
Bread was blah.
Out of a bag, boring, not tasty at all.
Garlic spread was all mayo and no flavor (I'd prefer to see more of an aioli type spread, but that's me being picky).
The only yummy thing about it was the turkey - which I can buy at Smith's for less.
At $7.99/sandwich (with no sides!
), I just expect a little more pizazz or taste.
Next time I'll try an Italian sub and hopefully it will be more exciting.
The fiance had some of the warm food - chicken cordon bleu with veggies and potatoes.
He loved it.
They also carry bfast and whatnot so I'm interested to try some of their other foods.

I had a sandwich from here.
I was not sure what to order, but my friend suggested that i try the chicken with cheese.
i was expecting something like sliced meat, but it twas a thick, juicy piece of chicken with cheese and and veggies.
I really enjoyed it, and they also included a mini anti-pasta salad and bread pudding.
I dont know if is how they normally do it, or if it was because i was with my friend, who is a regular.
Either way, i was happy regardless.
the prices may be high, but the sandwiches are very filling.
i had half for lunch and the other half for dinner   It breaks my heart that when i pass by, few cars are there.
It is located in the small plaza just underneath Carmine's on the Hill.
There isn't alot of businesses that are open at that plaza....bummer...
I hope you give it a try!

Closed.
Damn!

THIS RESTAURANT IS CLOSED!
The Pasta Shop took over the location, which is a huge upgrade.
