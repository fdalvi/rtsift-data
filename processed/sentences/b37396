Guitar Tree has an eclectic collection of rare and collectible guitars.
Their prices are reasonable, the customer service is excellent, and their love of guitars and music shows through the interactions they have with their customers.
Thanks for the gold top Les Paul, fellas.
It is amazing.

This place has some really unique guitars that you will not find anywhere else...
They also have a really great tech named Doug, who does amazing work and is very easy to work with.
I highly recommend checking it out.

I've spent endless hours walking around Guitar Center trying to find a guitar that sounds great, looks great and fits my budget ( about $500 ).
I walked into the Guitar Tree with the intention of browsing and walked out with the perfect guitar!
The staff was friendly and they have great products.
I recommend everyone gives this place a chance before making their next guitar purchase.

great shop!!!
nice guys!!!
they know their guitars and are always helpful.
I would recommend them over any other shop in the valley!!
love the Guitar Tree!!

If you're looking for some strange and awesome guitars this is the place!
Their guitar tech is also great and very fast had my guitar set up in a day!

I had been shopping for a guitar for my daughter around town and doing my homework on the Internet when I saw this place advertising on Craigslist.
I took the time to stop by and am so happy I did.
The staff was immensely helpful and I ended up walking out with two guitars, cases and a recommendation for lessons for less than I planned on spending.
Thank you Guitar Tree

I broke my acoustic guitar string early Saturday morning.
Called revolver records store and they sent me here for strings.
I rode my bike up here, nice little house, that's the business.
Can't miss it, big sign.
Cool people greeted me, no douche musician types that don't want to help you.
We chatted as they rung me up.
They told me they also carry vinyls here as well.
Good prices, I'll be back!
