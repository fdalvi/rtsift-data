Stayed in alot of shady Vegas hotels.
And this isn't the worst one..that warrants the dual stars.
Other than that, location is decent and price is right.

There is no reason to come here.
Well, the cafe is good.
If you are looking for affordable and good off-hour eats then come here and get your grub on!
Other than that, the tables (gambling kind) are kind of a joke and the rooms here... well, stay somewhere else.

good breakfast buffet and good steak and eggs deal.
but very crappy hotel.

the only thing that saves this crackhouse of a casino is it's all you can eat breakfast buffet.
wonder what it'll be like once it turns into the hooter's casino?
probly just as terrible.

Horrible, horrible, horrible.
First we made the mistake of getting off the elevator on the 5th floor which had been completely gutted for remodeling.
No wallpaper, no carpet, nothing but a lamp with no shade on the floor and an impending feeling of doom.
(our room was on another floor)  We were woken up to a giant jackhammer on the floor above us at 7am.
We then had to go through hoops to get moved to the 2nd tower which was not under construction.
The restaurant staff told us a meal would be comped and then tried charging for us.
The supervisor argued with us and basically told us we were lying.
When he went in the back we stole the food.
It's now the Hooters Hotel and Casino.
The construction is reportedly over, but as god is my witness i will never step  foot in that building again.
