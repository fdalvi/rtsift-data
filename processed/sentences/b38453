So, I had The Gyro & Fries.
It was pretty good I had Better But there's a lot worst out there too.
The atmosphere is real nice real clean, Its only been open 4 days so I hope It stays that way.
Nice and Friendly staff.
The only thing I would say I wasn't a fan of and to be honest it's not that big of a deal.
I prefer white onions on my Gyro not Red but it's still was good.
I'll Go Back For Sure

I ordered the chicken gyro and my boyfriend had the lamb gyro platter.
The meat was perfect, not overdone at all and was well seasoned.
The veggies were fresh.
It was reasonably priced especially for the atmosphere and the fact that you get real plates (I like that little detail.
) The outdoor seating is a plus too.
I would definitely come back.

I had the chicken and vegetable skewer, both were excellent and cooked to perfection.
The staff is very friendly and the service was excellent.
I would definitely go back!

Came here yesterday for the first time and was more than pleasantly surprised.
The area was very clean and tidy.
The food came quick and was delicious.
This is by far my new favorite greek restaurant!
I ordered a hummus and chicken plate and it was way better than pita jungle or any other local greek restaurant.
The staff were very helpful and friendly.
The owner, Mike was absolutely fabulous and wanted to make sure we were happy with everything.
I highly recommend this!

This section of Tempe has received a glut of Greek restaurants in the past year.
Within a 2 mile radius there's  Niro's, Tzikii's, Café Greco and one other I can't remember the name of.
This place is solid!
Yes, they are a little pricey but they are good.
Aesthetically speaking this is probably one of the nicest Greek restaurants I've been too, everything is very clean.
Their cash register is actually an IPad with Swype attached to it which is a little weird and cool all at the same time.
Their side Greek salad is very proudly prepared, I hate when the side Greek salad sucks, but this one had all the fixins (olives, pepperoncini's, onions, feta, tomatoes, cucumbers).
The Gyros are made to order, the meat is literally cut right off of the spit in front of you.
I can't wait to make my way through the rest of the menu.
I think this restaurant will be able to strongly compete against the other Greek restaurants in the area.

I live within a mile of this place and had been wishing for a good Greek restaurant to open up (plenty of not so good ones are already open).
Got my wish with this place.
The food is excellent, especially the chicken.
I really like that the owner, Don, is always in there working and taking pride in what he does.
Very friendly service, very modern and clean restaurant.
I eat here at least once a week.
- never disappointed.
They are also very good and fast with call in orders.

Great little Greek restaurant!
The staff is friendly and welcoming.
Stumbled upon this place through groupon and really glad I did!
Their gourmet gyros was amazing!!!!
I will definitely be back.

WOW!
I chose this place because I read a few nice reviews...
Guess what, those reviews lied!!
My husband and I walked into this very "tecky" style place.
(next to Jimmy Johns which is where we should have gone) They have menus on flat panel TVs and a very neat ipad looking checkout counter.
We went to a booth to wait for our food and had a different setting then normal.
The booths are VERY wide.
When we got our food it was awkward to eat because the seat is farther from the table then it should be.
(The table does move, but still is not planned well for groups/couples to sit across from each other) We were sitting on the edges of the booth and still leaning to eat.Now for the food we did get... We both ordered gyros, my husband got the soup and I got the salad.
The soup was so bland and tasteless we could not figure out what it was.
The texture was weird too.
I caved and asked the girl what it was and she said it was lentil soup.
I don't know where hey got their recipe, but it needs revised.
My salad was dressed with a dressing that wasn't shaken, it was very oily and also bland.
The gyros had nice pita bread, but that was it.
They are not shy on the amount of meat you get, but it has no flavor either!!
The tatziki was very watery and the tomatoes not ripe yet.
All in all, the food is substance and that is about it.

thought i'd try this place since its so near work but this is definitely the first and only time i'll go to Mika's.
i ordered the gyro platter ($12.95) with fries and salad.
at first glance this price is a little steep compared to other greek restaurants in the area ($8.95 or $9.95).
with a drink my lunch came to about $16.
a little high but i figured i'd give this place a shot.
i ordered to go and had to wait for about 20 min before my food was ready.
i was a little disappointed to see the size of the portions (this is a $16 lunch meal...).
getting this back to the office and digging in, i'm equally saddened by the just average taste.
the fries are not salted or crispy, the salad is bland, and the meat ... well it was definitely not plentiful and definitely not seasoned enough.
all in all a really disappointing experience.
YC's or jimmy john's will be getting my business when i turn into that plaza.

Within the past few months a slew of new lunch places have opened up by my work, one of them being Mika's Greek, so I was pretty excited to try them out.
When you 1st walk in, you think wow, what a cool looking place, its clean and modern, and has nice flat screen tv's on the wall, and when you pay you will notice their really isn't a cash register, it's like an ipad sort of thing, but I have to say its pretty cool.
Also the kitchen is opened, as you order can see them cooking the food, I like that.
I ordered the lunch special, I went with a chicken souvlaki pita which had sliced onions, tomatoes and tzatziki sauce and it came with a side order, and I chose fries.
The pita was nice and fresh, the chicken was tender and delish, great flavor, only down side to it was for me, there wasn't enough tzatziki sauce, but that's only because I really love that stuff!
Haha   It was a great lunch time meal, look forward to coming back and trying out the rest f the menu.

Very modern, friendly and fantastic food.
I am fortunate to work close by and stop in often.
The manager/owner is very friendly.
Overall great experience.

I felt like trying something new and I live right by Mikas.I have driven by thinking I need to try that place since I love Greek food.
I tried it today and it was amazing.
I had the original gyro and it was loaded with meat and it was perfectly cooked.
I also had the jalapeño hummus and Greek wings.
All were excellent.
The restaurant was also very clean and nice.
I called in my order and it was ready when I got there.
Highly recommended.

GIVE ME MOREEEEEE.
Okay this place is glorious.
My boyfriend and I bought a groupon to try it out which included a pita of your choice with a drink and a side.
Awesome.
I also had to get the hummus sampler because I loooove hummus.
I was so stoked when our food came out because the portions are nice and big, the fries looked fresh and crispy, hummus and my lentil soup looked delicious.
Thankfully I was starving that day, otherwise I would not have been able to finish my meal.
It was one of the best pitas I have ever had.
Fries, hummus and soup were divine.
Service was perfect.
The man who is there often is very nice and even nicer to look at, hahaha.
I love this place!
Try it!

I was super excited to try this place out because who doesn't like a little OPA!
in their life?
I must say this place is killer.
Clean and modern inside, helpful staff, and great Greek food.
I had the Grilled Greek Chicken platter and my Fiance had the Gyro platter.
We both split the Hummus sampler.
The gyro meat was moist and flavorful, grilled chicken with cooked to perfection with just enough spice to know it's "Greek Chicken", and the Hummus and Tzatziki were just out of this world!
Overall it was a good experience, will definitely be back!

Quite possibly the best gyro I've had in Arizona!
Mika's serves up reasonably priced meals with high quality, very fresh ingredients.
We came here with a Groupon and were pleasantly surprised by the quality, portions, and atmosphere of this cute little Greek eatery.
Our Groupon included 2 pitas and 2 fountain drinks.
We decided on the Mediterranean chicken and a gyro picado.
Each pita comes with a side (Fries, soup, salad, or rice).
We chose rice and soup as ours.
The gyro meat was tender, with well balanced flavors in the pita itself.
There was a lot of meat and veggies inside, which made the pita a great deal since it also included a side.
I loved that they had a unique twist on the classic gyro pita, adding jalapeno to the mix to add some spicy kick.
The lentil soup I had was quite good.
It had the right amount of spice, and was filling and hearty.
The Mediterranean chicken pita was also very good, with tender, juicy chunks of chicken.
The pitas themselves were soft, slightly grilled, and came with the option of regular or wheat.
I tried both types, and they were both equally good.
As for the side of rice, it was well seasoned, with a nice fluffy texture.
Fountain drinks are free-range, and there's also a tea station with several options of tea available.
Sodas are Coca-Cola brand products.
The atmosphere had a nice modern feel, very unlike other Greek places I've been to where they have a slightly outdated look, accentuated by those cheesy "GYROS" posters that look like they're from the '70s and '80s, of a young lady brandishing a gyro.
This restaurant is definite gem of a find through Groupon.
Go here if you want delicious Greek food!

Hands down the best Greek in town!
Quick service, always great food whether you dine-in or take-out, clean and modern atmosphere.
One of my favorites!
The Scottsdale location is amazing too!

What a joke these reviews with 5 stars are or family friends or members.
Decor nothing special except for I pads tje cashiers where using.
Atmosphere well there was a cook using a blender which made it a unique back ground.
Dolmas no flavor, greek fries are a joke, gyro was dry and old not even long  slices tazaki was tasteless greek salad was okay fries where soggy we where the only table in the restaurant.
Our bill was over $35 for lunch there are way better greek restaurants and way more affordable in the area.
For all of u that gave those 5 stars go try some other greek spots in the area then u will understand what I'm saying.

This place just opened a few months ago along with a few other Greek restaurants in this area.
There are now like 5 Greek places within a 2 mile radius of each other.
Strange that they all picked this area.
I think Mika's is one of the better ones though.
The restaurant is also very modern in its look.
Nice and clean too.
You can see right into their kitchen and watch them shave the meat right off the big roasting block of meat.
Their Gyros, the G is silent people, are really good.
They add diced tomatoes to their Gyros which I think adds a nice flavor and is different from the usual.
At least different form the Gyros I have gotten before.
Their fries are pretty good too.
Everyone in my office loves this place and every time they have a meeting they send me over here to get them lunch.
I don't mind.
I will back for sure.
Maybe not all the time because it is over $5 for lunch but it is still not bad and their gyros are packed with beef so definitely worth the money.
They have other specialty sandwiches that I might try at some point but it is hard to pass up a good Gyro.

Had original gyros and a Greek salad.
Loved it.
Very fresh.
And the Greek dressing was perfect.
I'll come back and try more items on the menu.

I've only eaten here 3-4 times now, but I will continue coming back.
Fast service, and very friendly staff.
I always end up getting the same thing, it's so delicious.
The Chicken Souvlaki pita is amazing.
Their grilled chicken is awesome.
Good pita bread, delicious hummus.
I also really like their Greek salad.
They have pitted kalamata olives, which is a plus.
I love Greek food!

My new favorite place for gyros!!
Large portions, choice of fries, salad or soup with with gyro for under $8.00.
Everything was fresh and clean.
Service was friendly and quick.
Will definitely be back!!

Absolutely delicious.
I discovered them by going to Jimmy John's and then deciding on them instead since they are next door.
Glad I did.
I can never turn down Greek food.
Everything here is delicious.
I usually get the Chicken Souvlaki Pita with a Greek Salad.
Amazing.
I have never been disappointed.
I really like that when I pay with my card I can earn stars, and after 10 meals I get one free.
Wonderful staff, always smiling and very friendly.
Definitely would recommend.

I LOVE MIKA'S GREEK!!
This place is located just a hop, skip, and jump away from where I work.
This is by far the best place to get a gyro or a pita.
My apologies to those other places who sell the same thing, there's a new sheriff in town and they blow you guys out of the water.
The customer service is great.
There is always a smile of their face, which makes a world of difference.
They're really quick, so this works out great when you're pressed for time.
I like to just call and order my food, very rarely does this take longer than 15 min.
The Chicken Souvlaki Pita is AMAZING!!
The chicken is never dry, it's always really tender and moist.
I'm super happy they opened up.
This place is great for lunch and dinner.
You must come here and try it for yourselves!

Great for kids -- and their grandparents.
Took all three grandchildren and all of us were happy with our meals.
Kids portions actually seem adult sized.
We were kinda like the Three Bears -- one had the chicken wings, 2nd had the grilled chicken, and the 3rd had the gyro.
Kids got right down to business and we could tell they were very happy with their dinner.
I was truly amazed at the amount of gyro meat for a child!
One grand-daughter sampled the rice that came with my delicious falafel platter, then asked for more -- wondered what gives it the yellow color.
Plenty of FRESH pita comes with all the plates.
This was our third time (husband and I) to come to Mika's, and all three times we've been very impressed: very clean, bright, roomy, friendly service, healthy and savory food.
First visit was with a DealChicken(I think--maybe it was a Groupon), so I'm hoping Mika's was well rewarded with that venture.
AND, daughter-in-law stopped in to retrieve her two daughters, decided to order, savored --  said Mika's will be on her restaurant rotation, too.
Opa!
My five stars-- for a quick meal, can't be beat.
Not for a date night aimed to impress, be aware.

Haven't had time to write a dazzling 5 start review of this place yet but after my delicious hummus plate, I figured I may as well.
Every time I walk into this place I am greeted by smiling face that seem genuinely happy to be at their job.
The owner is always around and is also very pleasant.
This is one of the cleanest places I have ever eaten, you can tell the employees and owner take great pride in their appearance because this place is sparkling.
The food is delicious, the BEST Greek in Tempe.
GO FOR THE JALAPEÑO HUMMUS, you'll never go back to pita jungle.

I should really write a review for this place since I eat here pretty much weekly for lunch.
My coworkers and I have tried all the nearby gyro places and we all agree Mika's is the best.
They even let me customize the Mediterranean like crazy (no tomato, no pickle, white pita, spicy tziki, spicy hummus).
Our only gripe is we wish they made a chicken shawarma pita also, since we can't find a good one nearby and we know theirs would be the best.
Very clean, nice digital menu boards and iPad registers, soothing new age music, and some of the best greek food in Tempe (especially for the price).
Can't go wrong!

This place is really, really good.
The chicken in their chicken pitas has a great marinade and the grill flavor is awesome.
They offer wheat pitas as an option which is really nice and their side greek salad is way above par for most greek salads.
The decor is also very modern and the restaurant is always extremely clean (bathrooms included).

It's GREAT Gyros, best around the restaurant is immaculate, etc.
Dito for all the reviews but someone needs to mention that they definitely "don't put enough of their tziki sauce on their gyros.
That is consistent we go there all the time and mention to them they always make you purchase another...

This was our first visit and we will definitely come back!
The food was very good, the dining room was very clean price was great for the amount of food we received!
The Greekumbers were very yummy!

Rough morning?
Rough week?
Rough MONTH?
(We won't go there) Forgot your lunch?
Mika's Greek to the rescue!
Been meaning to pop over here for a while now.
In search of something protein loaded / semi-healthy to fuel a workout, I got out of my office (and perhaps get out of my funk) and drove over to Mika's.
First of all, it's extremely clean and modern inside.
No frills decor, screens overhead detailing the menu and iPad registers.
Very nice gal who took my order.
I got the Chicken Souvlaki Pita combo with a salad.
$7.95.
No drink, but there's a Coke Freestyle machine here.
Food came out in about 15 minutes, piping hot.
Pst, secret's out: If you get there at or around 11, you'll get your food quickly before the lunch crowd arrives.
Generous portion of juicy, well marinated chicken with tomatoes, red onion and tzatziki sauce enveloped in what seemed to be a grilled pita.
While it was delicious and filling, the tzatziki sauce was lacking depth in flavor.
Where was the lemon, garlic and dill?
All I was tasting was yogurt and salt and pepper.
:(   The salad had all the characteristics of a typical Greek salad: Cucumber, tomatoes, onions, kalamata olives, sprinkle of feta cheese and a pepperoncini.
What I loved about it?
The dressing!
It was oil based, not creamy ranch like stuff like that one Greek place.
Next time I'll get it on the side though, as whoever prepped the salad went cookoo bananas with the dressing.
3.5 Stars: Nothing mind blowing here like my friends made it out to be.
Hoping this was just an off day with the Tzatziki because everything else was delicious.
I will definitely return to Mika's Greek to try their Original Gyro, with Andrew C. -  And perhaps up this rating!

Good quality food.
Free WiFi.
HiTech iPads for placing orders.
Will e-mail or text receipts.
A little pricy for a fast food bistro.
