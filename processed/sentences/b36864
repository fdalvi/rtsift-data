Need your shoe(s) shined?
Don't know where to go?
Bring one, a bunch or sit in the shoe shine booth and you can get them done here!
Location - For me, it is great.
On the Southeast corner of Pecos and Flamingo near the gas station.
Easy parking, right at the door of the entrance.
5 star  2.
Price - 6.00 for shoes and 8.00 for boots.
Can't get better than that!
5 star.
Quality - Nice.
Tim is the owner and he even took care of the threads from my leather shoes, that were fraying.
The shine is great and just right.
Not caked on and not the fake stuff.
All real wax.
5 Star  Where can you fine a shoe shine booth with an attendent?
At some of the casinos, at the airport, however, parking and access is tough and also the hours they have are tough.
This place is open 7 days a week from 8:00 am to 4:00 pm.
If you have a lot to do, suggest you drop them off and pick them up later.
I highly recommend this place.

Tim was great!
I can't recommend this place enough.
He gave my dress boots a great polish, gave me some pointers on caring for them a little better AND even taught be a better way to tie them.
I'm 31 and this guys is teaching me to tie my shoes?
Awesome.
This stand is over 25 years old and experience counts.

Great service!!!
Reasonably priced.

Tim is a wonderful gentleman.
I started to come to him about 3 weeks ago and come in weekly for him to touch up my boots.
He doesn't aim any less to make them shine bright to perfection.
Cost is feasible for the pocket but don't underestimate the dollar you give him for his work.
I highly recommend him and his services for all shoe shine.
Both skilled and knowledgable!
