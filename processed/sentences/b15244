Valley Respiratory is OK, but I am no longer a client.
I had a CPAP machine get stolen out of a rental car and they just completely couldn't deal with the situation.
Even though my health insurance plan allowed them to rebill for a new one, they just through up obstacle and objection and internal process and procedure rather than take care of the patient.
(ME)....  Anyways, this whole mess caused me to go to a new provider of services and they handled it promptly with one call to my health insurance provider.
Under normal circumstances these guys are OK, but I would reccomend going to a larger organization with nationwide presence such as Lincare.

AVOID.
I tried them again and they have gotten worse.
Called for supplies, and was told I had an outstanding balance.
Found out that A) Our bill was not late, and B) It was $11.
Can you believe these idiots?
AVOID AVOID AVOID.

Valley Respirator was the preferred vendor for Mayo Clinic and I have been very pleased with them.
Some slight miss-communication because my zip code is Goodyear but I work close to the Mesa office.
My supplies went to their Glendale office.
Billing has been painless and almost everything has been covered by my insurance and on-line payment of my bills have been flawless.

One of the most inept companies I have ever dealt with.
Forget getting a callback...I have been waiting for them to return my calls or emails for a week.
Called several times, left numerous messages...no response.
And wait until you order something...inevitably they will either send the wrong item or in my case lose the order entirely.
Pass this place up like the plague.
