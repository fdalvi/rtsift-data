I recently moved here and was looking to have a tattoo removed.
They also had this company with tattoo vanish where I had my tattoo removed.
I have always wanted to do permanent make-up but I was always hesitant.
I met the owner, Mary, who has 30 years experience and was rated one of the top in the country.
She made me feel very comfortable and relaxed about doing the procedure.
After my tattoo appointment I ended up getting my eyebrows done and I LOVED IT.
I am definitely going back to have the upper and lower eyeliner done.
The process did not hurt at all and was numbed before and during the process and my recovery time was very short.

I would highly recommend Mary's permanent cosmetics procedures!
I recently had my eyebrows done, and am EXTREMELY PLEASED the results.
Mary is professional, skilled, and knowledgeable.
She will custom design a timeless look specifically for you.
Thank-you, Mary!

Unfortunately, Mary Arnold-Ronish passed away on March 13, 2014 due to back surgery.
I will miss her greatly.
She was so professional and such a sweet person.
