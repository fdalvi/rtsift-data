My german shepherd/chow chow mix mutt received his first bath and brush from Tabby & Jacks on Capitol Square yesterday and he smells like a million bucks.
We did the bath for one hour plus the Furminator, 5-step special add on for $15 to help with his insane undercoat shedding.
I've shopped around and thought this was the best deal.
His coat looks healthy for spring and most importantly, is staying on him and not all over our house.
Other places I've tried in Madison didn't brush out the fur quite as well, so we will be back.
Another perk, Cooper's Tavern next door offers 10% off for customers that have bought a grooming session at T&Js.
So, while our pup was being washed, we dined and drank next door with our coupon, it was lovely.
One slight con: service checking in and out can be a little slow, especially as a first time customer.
Plan for a little bit of paperwork and extra time.
With that being said, he was done on time, as they had quoted.

Mrs. Flea (my dog) isn't a fan of having her toenails trimmed, and that's unfortunate, because she can grow some wicked talons in no-time.
I've tried (and failed) to cut her nails on my own; how a 5-lb dog an wriggle and wrestle so fiercely is beyond me.
After trying several other options for nail cutting (vets, other groomers), I think I've found a winner.
Marcelle did an awesome job of trimming Flea's ridiculously long nails, and she did so in just a few minutes and with zero drama.
The rate was more than reasonable; I've paid twice as much for a nail trimming at the vet, and it wasn't half as good.
Book online, get your confirmation, bring in your four-legged-friend, and leave happy.
It really is that simple.
Oh, and BTW - Marcelle gave my friend's dog a super awesome lion cut a few weeks ago.
She did such a great job with it; he gets tons of compliments on the cut.

ZERO STARS for GROOMING.
DO NOT get grooming from Tabby & Jacks in the Madison area.
They are the reason I have spent close to $1500 now getting rid of my dog's MRSA ear infection.
Yes, you read that right- MRSA.
I called and left a message for their manager, in a very nice, heads up sort of way, and they couldn't even be bothered to call me back (It's been a week).
Seriously, my message was like "I'm not litigious, and I don't want anything from you, but you need to look into this because it's 99.999% chance from you.
" Too bad, I (and my dog) liked the individual groomer, but clearly their institution has some serious issues with cleanliness and, almost worse, can't even follow up on a concern this big with a repeat client.
DO NOT trust your pets' health there.
