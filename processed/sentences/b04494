I've tried Barbers all over Glendale, and Najib is by far the best around.
This new shop he is working at is really cool as well.
It's sports themed with nice TVs and sports decor everywhere.
They also have an active duty military discount.
You won't be disappointed.

I've had about 5 different barbers here, and never once had a bad cut.
They all seem to know what they're doing.

Found a new place since I came to town and like it.
Had to say good bye to my Gal in NJ.
Sorry Stacey.
Roseanne is my new clipper!

What a bunch of really cool guys.
Came in on a Sunday afternoon to get my son a cut and they had him looking right for Monday morning.
Prices were reasonable and conversations pricesless.
These guys are super nice, and makes the kids feel very releaxed.
This will be his spot unles we move.
