This is just a regular old subway really and even though no matter where you are every subway smells the same and no matter what subway you get they all just taste the same - I just can't help but like them, well, as long as my sub comes with plenty of Southwest sauce.
I usually go for the sub of the day as at £1.99 it's a bargain, and like I said, no matter what you get they all taste the same anyway.
I popped in here the other day, but instead of a sub I opted for the nachos that have recently appeared on the menu.
Plenty of nachos, lots of cheese and a generous helping of salsa and jalapeños too - no complaints from me!

Standard subway, reliable taste wherever you go.
It's my favourite.
