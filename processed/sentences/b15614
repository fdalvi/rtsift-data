Slow as a slug, and they usually eff up my order but its ok.
I continue to go here for sweet teas with lemon, and when I order food they usually forget something Im ok with that.
This place has a horribly small through lane if you dont wanna go through th drive thru, SO BEWARE!!
We also go here bc they have my sons Mcdonalds night so we go and eat out little ice cream with fries and enjoy the AC.
The drive through is SOOO SLOW and the workers are usually rude but what do you expect?
They hate their job, but please dont forget my lemon in my sweet tea!
Cheap fatty food, but if youre in a semi rush or dont wanna cook go for it bro!

Its a McDonalds, clean but staff is young and immature.

Want a quick water cus its 108 outside?
Sure.
Tap water $1.00 didnt want to pay for tap water just a cup?
.64 cents for a water cup.

12:30pm:  The woman who took my order was pleasant enough.
The manager-type who put out my order seemed harried.
Not sure who was responsible but I had to ask for my drinks.
It was the rush hour so I'll give them a break, although I did notice the pick-up counter was getting backed up with people waiting for corrections.
2:00pm:  I ordered a sundae for me and a shake for my son.
The man who took my order was very pleasant.
Although  it was not busy at this point, the manager-type still seemed harried and flustered.
I saw her make the shake and then disappear.
The young man who brought out the sundae had to go looking for the shake and found it at the drive-thru window.
The good parts:  the Playland space was clean and the wifi worked.
Oh yeah, and it was cheap.
The ice cream was very good.
It just bums me out that I could have gone to In-N-Out, where they always get my order right and they are friendly and efficient.
If it wasn't for Playland, I wouldn't go here.
