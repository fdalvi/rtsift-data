We got off to rocky start, but the folks over at Complete Marine came through in the end.
Thanks for sticking with it!

Not very happy with complete marine  went in looking for a steering system for my pontoon project  bought a rack system steering kit and had to pick it up from marine wholesale like 5 miles away when I got the  package it was one that they have in there   Catalog for $159.
And I was charged $199 plus tax ,went back to complete marine, they said they could get the same product but they'ed have to order it from California and I would have to pay shipping !
not sure why they can't honor the catalog price !
Doesn't seem right to me!
$40 mistake on my part  Lost customer for them.

We bought  Bayliner from Complete Marine and it has been a good experience.
Larry, our salesman was great, and Lee who went to Bartlett Lake with us is very knowledgeable  and patient.
We decided it would be best if  Idrove the truck, and my husband drove the boat when we put it in the water.
Lee was wonderful in showing us how .
The other dealers didn't seem to care if we bought a boat or not, but we felt welcome at Complete.
5 stars for Complete!

I've purchased boats in the past, as well as cars, both new and used.
I can't say I've had a better experience than what I received at Complete Marine.
Larry was the sales person and he took care of everything for us, acting as our POC for trade-in, paperwork, and service.
This dealership also allowed a "lake test" of a used boat and worked with the schedule of when I was available.
I would recommend anyone shopping for a new or used boat start with Complete Marine.
You won't need to visit anywhere else to find a great customer experience.
