I have been wanting to stop by one of these since I got here, in spite of the fact that they are a fast food chain.
The reason is because I remembered how good their oysters were.
I decided to get the 7 piece fried oysters and chips meal instead of just the 4 piece.
It was a whopping $4.50.
It was 50 cents extra for a 5 oz tarter sauce.
The oysters were as good as I remembered and I was glad I stopped.
The fries were a bit salty but still better than a lot of places.
I will definitely keep this on my must visit when in Arizona list.

Ugh.
It's just not very good and the service is lacking.
Go a little further to Pete's Fish & Chips.
It is worth it.

Food is absolute garbage.
Came out stale and cold.
A completely unsuccessful rip-off of Pete's.

Places like this should just close down.
Horrible food...horrible service...the employee complained because I didn't call in my order for 2 crappy meals.
You're better off taking the bun off a fish filet from mcdonalds and eating it with ketchup...nuff said.

This place closed down three months ago.
