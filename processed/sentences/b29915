Sara is an amazing and intuitive massage therapist.
She has a great sense of the body and how to seek out my problem areas, and really gives such a great overall experience.
I reccomend her highly!
I've been to many massage therapists in my time- and no one was able to completely relax me like Sara.
Make that appointment today...

I have gotten MANY massages and Sara is by far the BEST!
She is energetically intuitive and an extremely adept bodyworker.
Sara always takes the time to really find out what I need and then caters the session directly to those needs.
She had a beautiful technique and has helped me reduce my body tension, anxiety, and TMJ.
Sara has helped me create a better sense of overall well being and I am so grateful.
I highly recommend regular sessions with her.
She's wonderful!

Sara has healing energetic hands.
She massages from an intuitive healing place.
You are surely going to be in complete bliss after her work.
You must try it to believe it!

I have literally had hundreds of massages in my life and Sara stands out amongst the best.
I have been receiving regular bodywork from her over the past 8 months and she has helped me recover from stress, structural alignment issues, headaches and fatigue.
I feel renewed after each and every session.
I highly recommend her to anyone looking for quality, therapeutic massage and bodywork.

Emailed today to get a massage, Sara responded back immediately.
