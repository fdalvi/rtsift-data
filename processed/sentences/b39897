This is another wee gem for lunch.
My vegetarian pals particularly like this place because the menu usually offers them a good choice.
You can get a really health lunch or snack here but its not as cheap as some places in the vacinity.
We can usualy get a table here which makes me wonder if some people presume you need to be attending something in the Storytelling Centre to use the cafe.
Its ideal for just a coffee as the coffee is really nice here.

This review is for the cafe.
We ate here for breakfast and then again for lunch.
Embarassingly forgot to pay for the breakfast so we came back, paid and then stayed for lunch.
Both meals were reasonably priced & staff was friendly.
Good food too.
