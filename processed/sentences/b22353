On a family vacation in Vegas last week we ate at this restaurant and experienced the worst service I think I've every experienced in my life.
We were at the restaurant at opening time in order to make a show a little later that evening and everything moved at snails pace from the moment we arrived.
The real capping moment was when after a very long wait for our food my 6 yr old's food came out incorrect.
There was a complete lack of regard from our waiter and most of the restaurant staff as to this issue and while they did finally bring a replacement there was no urgency and no apology.
In fact the replacement came 15 mins before our show was about to start so my daughter was never fed.
That's 1 3/4 hours to get a pizza.
The only reason I'm not giving it 1 start is my wife liked her food.
Did I mention the point when the waiter poured water on my Dad, or when the wine was delivered but then not opened for 10 minutes....

Room service had an hour wait, so I tried this place.
Not worth the $$$.

Quick and cheap, two things that you dont find often in Vegas.
Everyone were super nice and smiled.
If I stay here again, I'm definitely stopping in again
