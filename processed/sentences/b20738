Chinese restaurants that have a dual role as both takeaway and dining venue often have to struggle with the annoyance of takeaway customers shimmying past the tables and the preconception of takeaway quality food served in a restaurant environment.
Kwok doesn't seem to address these issue with full success but does provide some interesting and tasty dishes.
What Kwok does have, however, is a ability to offer some unusual alternatives to the usual Chinese cuisine regulars.
An interestingly spiced 'Eight treasure shredded duck' and a dish of mussels in black bean sauce are a few of the unique offerings.
The menu is hit and miss, though, some dishes will leave to satisfied and other will leave you questioning the flavour combinations.
B.Y.O.B and some inexpensive set menus equate to a cheap eat though, so Kwok is worth a try.

Kwok may not be the classiest of Chinese restaurants, but its specials board in particular reflects the quality of the experience you can have in here.
The service is friendly and the food, although not speedy to reach you, doesn't take too long to arrive.
The menu is extensive, but I would certainly advise looking at the specials for something unusual to try.
I went for a white fish stew which was served in a delicious oyster sauce and their tasty special fried rice.
They also do a takeaway menu which is a hit with the locals and they seem to have good banter with the staff.
Their prices are what you'd expect and I paid about Â£10 for my meal which was pretty reasonable.
I'd come here again just for that specials board.

Before I tried Kwok I hadn't eaten in a Chinese restaurant for about 2 years as I found most to food to be no better than a microwave meal.
You won't find any of that here though as the food is always fresh and good quality.
It is definetely not glamourous surrounds with the paper table cloths but the welcoming atmosphere and great value more than make up for this.
The owners are also great fun when they have time to come and chat.
Kwok has restored my belief in Chinese cuisine.

We were in on a weeknight back in July while on vacation in Scotland.
Rating Kwok 5 stars because the food was fresh and good quality despite being relatively late on a slower night with service was helpful and friendly.
We had a nice chat with the folks and the pace of the meal was just right for us.
The choices include the standards of Chinese cuisine but also some house specials or combos that were interesting.
We'd certainly go back if we're ever in town again.
