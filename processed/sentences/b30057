Highly recommend you attend this Art Expo.
Very high qualify artists.
Watch their works in progress.
Don't miss the show.
Check out their website at http://www.arizonafineartexpo.com.

This show is a ten-week show that is open every day from the end of January till the beginning of April.
It seems like there are about 80-90 different fine art artists who have working studios/galleries.
The artwork here is diverse and beautiful.
I saw contemporary and traditional artwork.
The show has bronzes, jewelry, photography, oil painting, kaleidoscopes, acrylic paintings etc.
There is also a cafe that serves coffee and tea, sodas, water, breakfast, lunch and snacks.
I ate a cheeseburger and it was very good.
I also saw some information that there are free art classes for veterans.
The day I went, the veterans were learning to sculpt for future bronze pieces.

The Arizona Fine Art EXPO, produced by the award-winning Thunderbird Artists, showcases more than 100 nationally-acclaimed artists applying their artistic talents in studios.
This event gives patrons unprecedented access to watch the world's most gifted artists.
This coming January 19 through April 1, 2012 will be my 4th year exhibiting here.
Great artists and great art.
A great way to spend a day.
