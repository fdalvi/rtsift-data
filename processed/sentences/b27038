I trusted this criminal with an expensive weighted 88 key MIDI controller that I was very fond of.
All it needed was to be opened up and an internal battery replaced.
After 3+ months of excuses (a different one each phone call) I just gave up on it.
I'm convinced this individual is a scam artist that gets people to leave their valuable gear with him, and he turns around and sells it.

The truth about 911 Keys and sound is that Mr Davis is one of the most reputable and professional  repair services.
He may be busy because he is so  good  but his integrity is never in question.
I have worked with Mr Davis for over 20 years

Heard of 911 from a friend.
Great local place for any repairs you may need.
Mr. Davis got my Yamaha keyboard back to me in tip top shape.
Very professional and nice as can be.
Definitely the only technician I will be taking my equipment to now.

I have a Baldwin DC 100 baby grand piano, that suddenly had power failure.
I was referred to 911 keys & sound from another reputable piano repair place.
Alex told me upfront what the initial charge would be.
He was very courteous, helpful and was able to repair the piano to my surprise on the first visit.
Saving me more time and money.
I definitely would use 911 keys & sound again with confidence.
