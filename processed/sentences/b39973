I opened my Chase bank account at this location because it was close.
When I opened my account, my banker was friendly and gave me all the information I needed.
She answered all my questions and made sure I was happy with everything because I had explained about my past banking experiences.
When I went back to ask about setting up my online banking, the teller was nice enough to show me how and did it right there for me.
I had returned again to deposit several transactions and they explained how to do it through the ATMs outside and inside the store.
They're quick and friendly compared to other banks I've been to.

I haven't actually been inside, but found the outdoor drive thru well-lit and clean.
You can tell that this location is new.

The staff at this location is great!
My wallet disappeared while I was on vacation in Las Vegas and they were very helpful.
Don't get me wrong, I had to jump through a few hoops to prove I was me, but that is exactly the way it should be to protect my information.
The folks at Chase, especially the manager (I think her name was Sarah) saved my Vegas vacation!!!
Thank goodness for the new instant debit card service and the wonderful helpful staff at this location!

Best Chase Bank in town.
Clean office, friendly and professional staff and the bank kiosk inside lets you make withdrawals any kind of way you want.
If u want $17, $56, $763 ect.
It lets you choose what bills u want  1, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 dollar bills.
Pretty cool to me.
Now I don't have to be stuck with a bunch of $20 bills
