Dirty, indifferent (borderline rude) staff, the place is a pigsty, poor selection (poorly stocked, I guess), and did I mention the place is fucking filthy?
Flies and crickets abound (and I don't mean the ones you can buy as lizard food), lots of bags of dog food leaking on to the floor, etc etc...just terrible...almost depressing.
To the employees at this establishment (who might be all related, from the vibe I got on a hot and humid day not too long ago) - I'm sorry you have to work retail, and on a Sunday.
Bear in mind there's always someone out there who will gladly take your job and do it far better.

For a big box pet store it is about as good as it get in my opinion, not that I have been to all of them but I have been to a few of them.
