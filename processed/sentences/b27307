I can always count on Daniel to make my hair look great!
I have been all over the valley getting cuts and color, and no one does a consistently better job.
I would follow him anywhere.

Daniel is really awesome!
I have gotten so many compliments, from many different people, on how great my hair looks!!!
He truly listens to what I want as a customer and then goes about cutting, coloring, and creating as he cultivates my appearance.
I also appreciate the fact that he works with me on my eclectic schedule.
Moreover, I like how he posts "special rates" on his FaceBook page : )  I would highly recommend his services to anyone, whether you are a male or a female.
Daniel at Alchemy is a 5-Star Stylist!

When I moved to Phoenix from NYC 6 years ago, I tried about 10 salons and couldn't find one with which I was happy, including some big, expensive salons.
I found Daniel in 2007 when he was working at another salon, and I've been following him every since.
I have never had a bad haircut, my color is always perfect, and he makes himself available to me whenever I need him.
Plus, his prices are very competitive.
I tried two other salons through the discount emails and each time Daniel had to fix my hair.
I will never go to anyone else again!
I recommended him to friends who tried him and they were very happy as well.
I agree... he's a 5-star stylist!

I tried Daniel after reading these reviews.
Although I only went to him a handful of times as I've just moved out of state I would highly recommend him.
He knows what he's doing with hair color and his cut was very clean and perfect for straight or curly hair.
Thanks again Daniel!
