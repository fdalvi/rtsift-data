I purchased 2 Chicken Parmesans, and went home, apx .5 mi from store.
I added a liberal amount of refrigerator ketchup, my wife a ranch from the store.
About 1/3 in I realized it was raw, not a little pink but mostly.
I went back to the store and spoke with manager Armando and showed him the sandwich.
He said he would make two more and disappeared, no apology, nothing.
Another worker dealt with us and was courteous but again not even an apology

Burger King tries really hard to be as good as McDonald's!
I received a coupon from one of the Phoenix area coupons books that all school kids seem to sell these days.
The expiration was at the end of the month, so I decided to give them a try.
Wow, the menu has gone upscale!
Now, we have good looking salads, wrap sandwiches, smoothie drinks and even Cinnabons.
Also, Burger King has this new TV ads featuring celebrities like David Beckham, Jay Leno, Salma Hayek and R&B singer Mary J. Blige.
Who sings about the ingredients of their snack wraps.
Sad.

Their Classic Chicken Sandwich is still a piece of process meat, and the Whopper still has those little pieces of brown substance on one side of their burger.
My last rant will be the taste of their onions, which still tastes as if they've left them out too long and have oxidized.
I know I'm going to regret it in several hours.
