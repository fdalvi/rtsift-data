Rude welcoming by owner.
Store was completely empty and owner yells from back of salon "what do u need".
Walked out before giving a dime to a business that doesn't understand service

I had a great experience.
I stopped in not really knowing what time it was, and they took me right away.
I arrived before they even opened, oops.
What great service to get me started to soak while they finished setting up.
It's a little hidden in the strip mall, but clean, and affordable.
Since this place is under new management there was a special for a manicure and pedicure for $30!
Well worth it.
I will be going back and am telling all my friends to go there too.
I really liked that the owners asked me questions and got to know me.
I felt like I was one of the family.

This is the ONLY place I get my nails done because they style the best, most detailed work and are so incredibly caring.
Tim and Kimmy are the sweetest ever and Kimmy consistently has a new type of polish or design to try!
Gorgeous shades and designs to choose from and a huge variety of gel polish.
Love them!!!
