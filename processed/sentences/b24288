A very solid, inexpensive pizza buffet.
I like the food much better than Cici's.
The cheesy breadsticks are heart-stoppingly good.
The buffet includes a salad bar and some pastas, but I usually stick with the pizza.
Only thing lacking is the dessert selection doesn't compare with Cici's.
A lot of the time there is no dessert pizza out.
They will make whatever you ask for though so that's a definite plus.
Could stand to have the tables and booths wiped down a bit more frequently as well.

This restaurant is now closed and was replaced by a place called NaNos
