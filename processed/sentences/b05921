This Brakes Plus.
The is best Brakes Plus.
Jeff And Lee are great.

Just finished an oil change.
Known Jeff and Lee since they opened in 1999.
Prices and work have been great.

I've known that this place has been here for awhile and is privately own so I decided to finally get an oil change and for them to check the brakes on my '08 scion TC.
First, let me mention sometime last year I had them check my brakes cause it was screeching from my previous brake job from just brakes and I was told they were fine and it's probably cause they use cheap products.
So this time around I got my oil changed and a brake job and when I drove off I had a loud metal scraping sound coming from my car.
So  I just back and luckily caught the owner 10min.
past closing and he repaired the metal scraping sound.
I really think since I was the last customer on a friday afternoon my brake job was neglected.
To top it off, my parking brake was somehow changed because it does not always engage and I was pretty upset at the situation.
It has been 2 days past so this review is not out of anger.
I really wanted to trust this shop but I dont think I will return.

I've been coming to Jeff and Lee at brakes plus since I moved to Vegas almost 2 years ago.
I've received nothing but the best service from them.
They came at a recommendation from my parents and my tax specialist.
I bring my cars here for everything.
I happy to have found an auto shop where I don't feel that I need to get a second opinion on any diagnosis.
Great guys at this shop

Not sure how my original post ended up in "tips".
Just retyping it here under reviews.
I just read some of these negative reviews and I was offended by it.
First off, I'm a female.
Secondly, I've been going to Lee and Jeff since right after they opened because my father found them first.
I have referred countless people and businesses over the years, had people thank me for it and I will continue to do so.
Never in my life have I met more honest mechanics that DON'T treat women like morons.
If you want honesty and a true commitment to service, check them out!
