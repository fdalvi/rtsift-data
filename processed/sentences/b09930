A client's husband passed away and in calling florists to inquire of services, I finally gave up and walked into the local Safeway.
Not the greatest selections, but in this pinch, they came through with a beautiful arrangement; affordable too.

This is the closest convenience store near my house and I really like the staff here.
They open up new registers as soon as they see the lines getting long and they're really helpful and friendly.

I came here after reading online that this bakery would make custom cakes.
After just visiting their bakery right now I now know that statement is false.
They will only make cakes that are in their book and won't change a thing to customize it.
The only change the lady in the bakery mentioned was that they could just ice a cake and sell it to me just like that and I could decorate it myself.
What the heck seriously?
I think that defeats the purpose of me buying a cake from a Bakery!
