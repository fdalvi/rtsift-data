Great guys with the best equipment and the lowest prices that I could find anywhere!

My first trip to AZ and a friend of mine recommended Go Fast Rentals in Mesa.
The staff was great in helping us select a off road toy for the weekend.
We landed on a UTV Two seaeter and headed to the dessert.
Other than that one time with a blonde in Cabo this was the greatest weekend.
The UTV was brand new and quick, it felt like we were doing over 60mph in the dessert and your couldn't feel a thing.
At the end of our trip the drop off process was really easy.
I can't wait to come back for another weekend.
highly recommended, you wont regret it!
