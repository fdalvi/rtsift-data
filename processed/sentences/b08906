I can't believe I have been fooled by all of those horrible commercials "2 pair of lens plus the eye exam for $59.99!
" for so many years.
I didn't understand what a true optometrist could be until now.
Dr. Biglaiser is totally old school, he has been practicing for 50 years, FIFTY YEARS!
and he knows what he is doing, PLUS, extra bonus he has frame inventory starting from way back when he first started practicing.
So if you are looking for true authentic 50's, 60's, 70's, glasses you should stop by, I had a blast just trying all them on.

This place is a joke.
I have reported to our insurance company for fraud.
They billed us for lenses we didn't get and also charged our insurance company for a contact lens fitting we paid out of pocket for.
Save yourself the time and hassle.
I've been working with our insurance company to get this rectified, but honestly, what a mess.
I will say the exam was thorough, but it did take a long time (4+ hours for two of us).
It's safe to say we'll be staying far far away from this place.
