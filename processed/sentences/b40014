I should by all means be the duke of tropical smoothie cafe but I always forget to sign in.
XD   That being said I intend to claim my title in the near future as I don't plan to stop coming anytime soon.
This is the first place for which I ever use a full publication of coupons.
I am genuinely in love.
My mainstay smoothie is the health but.
It's not overly sweet and is rather smooth and creamy.
I feel like there is actually a good amount of sustenance behind it.
Today I went with the southwest chicken salad and it far surpassed my expections.
Id take a picture but it's already gone!
The island green is definitely delicious too.
I have tried a few others and have enjoyed them all.
The only problem I have is I wish they had different sizes of smoothie but I won't hold that against them.
Despite a bit higher price than the average place I pop into for lunch TSC makes it worth it in quality and I am more than happy to write a five star review!

This place is great!
Staff is super nice!
Place is clean!
Smoothies are not only awesome tasting but are healthy too!
Don't forget they have food!
I realized you can swap fake chicken in for the real thing and it tasted awesome!
I will def be back!

Great tasting smoothies friendly customer service and they are pretty good with not messing up orders.
They messed mine up one time but if your looking for a good sized great tasting smoothie this place is at the top of my list.
