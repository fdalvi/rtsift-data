I contracted 5 Pints to produce a real estate website a couple of years ago.
They were very helpful with the set up and training to manage the site once it was up and running.
In the months since the launch they have always responded quickly to my questions and changes or improvements were performed quickly at a reasonable cost.
I would recommend 5 Pints to others looking to boost their businesses web presence.

I utilized 5 Pints Productions to upgrade my website.
They did an oustanding job.
Great attention to detail, provided me with helpful suggestions and actively looked for ways to deliver the results I desired at the minimum cost possible.
They were able to come up with a number of creative solutions along these lines.
Every time I've worked with them they are knowledgeable, friendly, professional, and the final result is top-notch.
If you are looking for website or video production help, I would highly recommend you check out 5 Pints Productions.

I have had 5 Pints do 2 web sites for my Business - The first one blew us away compared to our old one - Our customer responses/emails were up 20-fold conservatively.
They do a great job of setting it up and then training so that we can control our own changes.
When issues arise they have also been extremely responsive to correct or adjust the site as needed...
I would highly recommend any business small or large to have Justin and his staff either update or create your web-site!!

Justin has been our web designer going on 2 years and we couldn't be more impressed with Justin and his team.
He took us out of the 90's and brought us into the 21st century lol.
5 Pints has created 5 different website for our company and we are so impressed with each one.
We would highly recommend this team of professional, courteous and just an outgoing individuals.
