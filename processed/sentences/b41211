This McDonald's is located in the Midway section of Circus Circus where the circus acts are performed and kids games played.
I believe the prices are the same as regular McDonald's locations.
They are not priced higher just because they are located inside a Hotel Casino in Vegas.
So that's a good thing.
There are plenty of tables for seating.
Nice spot to getaway from some of the craziness in the casino and/or children's games.

HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!
They gave me half my order and told me I would be called again when the rest of my order was ready.
Well I was never called so when I went up to the counter to inquire about my order, the employee was very rude and claimed I was called several times which is a lie because I was waiting at the counter.
I had to go back to the counter when I realized those idiots forgot to give me my drink cups and I was scolded that I should've asked for my drink cups when I picked up my food.
As I was walking away they were loudly talking $ht about me.
UNBELIEVABLE!

This is probably the best customer service I've gotten at a McDonald's ever in my life.
Their cashier Felecia was so nice that it caught me off guard.
Of course it's just your regular McD's but with fast & friendly service!
