Plain and simple..it doesn't matter if the bathroom is clean and the receptionist is friendly...the ONLY thing that matters is whether a patient got the results he or she should have expected.
In my case the answer is a great big NO.
I paid a lot of money and spent a lot of time only to have to get the same dental work done all over again because what was done here didn't work.

Have gone here for years.
Love the staff and the office is very welcoming.
Would not go anywhere else

We love Dr. Isom and his staff!
The location is perfect and the office is always clean and up to date.
Grateful for their service!
