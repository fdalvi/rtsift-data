My grandparents went here, my parents go here, and now I go here.
That should say something in and of itself.
The staff here that I've dealt with have always been pleasant.
Plus, he's got an in-house lab for all your blood draws and UA's and such.
Dr Drury himself is always pleasant.
He takes his time with patients, answering all your questions and never making you feel rushed.
Because he does this with all his patients, sometimes you have to sit in the waiting room a little longer.
Overall, top notch.

He is an awesome doctor.
My husband and myself owe him many thanks for saving my husbands life with his thoroughness.

We have been with Dr. Drury for 6 years and highly recommend him.
He listens to you, does not rush you and refers to specialists if needed.
The office is changing and I hope he will still be as accessible as he has been.
They are a busy, full service practice with a lab that is expanding.
NP and PA Sarah and Mary are also highly recommended.

I love this guy!
He's old school and a very competent Dr.!

Dr Drury is the best doctor I have ever had in my 59 years of life.
He is sensitive, listens to you and is a great diagnostician.
My only issue is that he recently joined the IMS corporate  group which is a terrible mistake.
They are generally incompetent, the billings are often incorrect  and billed deceptively to make the most money possible.
It is very sad that such an  exceptional physician feels the need to join this pathetic organization.
The previously wonderful office staff seems to have disappeared as well and you now must deal with rude and disrespectful personnel.
If you can deal with the disgraceful bureaucratic mess of the office now, then I highly recommend him as an excellent practitioner.
Make sure you don't let the office staff and other practitioners mis code your visits.
It is all about money now that the corporation is running the show!
