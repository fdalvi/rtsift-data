Clean, friendly, good selections and a great location.

I don't shop at Safeway much but when I do go there for a specific item, I always enjoy going into their store.
Clean.
The deli counter peeps seem to be really nice.
Managers are a hoot.
Like I said before, I don't shop Safeway often but I do like this one when I need a specific item.

Screw these guys.
They decide to expand their store and in the process kill a small business.
The Mail Vault was closed with 2 days notice to accommodate their expansion.
I am all for saving money on food, but I will never spend a dime there after they had shown their true colors.
I don't care if its the leasing companies fault, they managed to kill a the type of small business that supports the American economy.
If I could post a huge middle finger to this company I would!

Small store but the great employees and managers  make it up for it.
Wouldn't shop anywhere else!

It's a grocery store...
I don't know exactly how to review it  It offers the same as most other stores... And as with everything sometimes prices are good and sometimes prices are bad  It's close to where I live and convenient
