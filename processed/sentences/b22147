If the food wasn't so cheesy (i mean literally) I would rate it 4.5 but then again, i don't really have the option anyways, ;-)   Great little town next to Madison - my boyfriend n I were on road trip and didn't wanna eat @ any chains - so we took the map of Madison area and threw a dart @ it.
It landed on Middleton and so did we...   Bavaria Cafe is nicely decorated and have some yummy cakes and pastries you must try to believe.
We got chicken quesdillas and it was more cheese then chicken/vegs.
Not a fan of that - I stuck to the carrot cake and let my bf finish the quesadilla.
He has no complaints.
Corona for $3.25!
Also try the spotted cow.
;-)

Went to the Bavaria this morning for breakfast...it's pretty much your local family restaurant...complete with flowery booths and more than a handful of "regulars".
The only thing I didn't like was the fact that my waitress seemed in a rush to get my order.
She asked me if I wanted coffee before I even got my butt in the chair(I DID look tired...), and came back with a cup in 30 seconds...and wanted my order.
I asked for a minute, and that's what she gave me.
Feeling rushed(I was torn between the blintzes and the eggs Benedict), I went for the blintzes.
They were quite good(better than the coffee which was nothing better than tolerable).
Really, two could have split one order.
I'd go again, but I guess I should have my order on-hand.

Sofra offers a mix of American and Mediterranean cuisine.
I visited around 1pm on a Tuesday.
The place was nearly full, and we were seated promptly.
The interior is comfortable--and interesting mix of cusual and upscale decor.
The waitservice was very professional.
I ordered a Turkey Avocado Sandwich.
It arrived promptly and tasted good.
The menu is quite extensive and there is a good selection of daily specials.

2's little harsh, it's more like 2.5.
I smelled bleach as soon as I sat down at a booth near restroom.
But that was only a warning sign.
While my friends seemed to enjoy their omelet and benedict for brunch, my so-called Belgian Waffle suffered from a serious identity crisis.
I want to know what was Belgian Waffle about it.
What I got was a pale colored, flavorless slab with out-of can syrup/juice immersed soggy mess.
Wow, really.
How could you do that to a plate of waffle?
The service was ok.
Pleasant, but without a charm.
The place gets busier with after-church crowd on Sunday.
So timing is a key.

It was soooo much better before they changed the name!
Way to pricey now for what you get.
Menu turned more upscale.
The old Bavarian was a much better place.

Really good for lunch!
The tortilla soup was good, and I had a delicious salad with lamb and beef sausage.
Quick, friendly service too!

Could have been one of the worst meals we have had in ten years.
I got the baked cod with roasted potatoes.
The fish was a perfectly shaped rectangle that tasted like cardboard.
Had to have been from a box.
Also, still wondering how to make roasted potatoes tasteless, but they did it.
My mom didn't even finish her bowl of soup, and it was all she ordered.
It was my second visit, and deinitely my last.
Don't waste your money here.

If you want to get away from the chain store restaurants that dominate in this area and try some excellent Mediterranean food for dinner, this is the place.
As long as you aren't looking for fine dining.
Run by an Albanian native, Sofra has an eclectic menu.
We went all Mediterranean, and loved it.
First the wine list: Three or four dozen wines, good choices from all over the world, with only one priced over $30.
Great start.
Once we understood the owner's background, we decided to go all appetizers.
We had calamari, hummus, olives, and dolma for a light dinner.
The servings were all large, accompanied by plenty of pita bread.
The olives were good, the calamari was predictable, the hummus was delightful.
The dolma: Absolutely delicious.
The best I've ever had.
They were cooked well so the grape leaves were nice and tender.
The rice and feta combination inside was just right.
Then the yoghurt/dill/oil sauce made them outstanding, with a hint of tartness and a burst of flavor with each bite.
Nothing dull about them.
They were memorable, enough so that I'll make an effort to go to Sofra's when in the area just to have the dolma again.
The decor matches the menu - a bit of everything.
Service was good.
This isn't a white table cloth restaurant.
It's a fun place with some outstanding Mediterranean food.

I had brunch there last weekend and was in food heaven.
I have a rule that I never order any dish that I can make myself, so I immediately gravitated to the Albanian sausage dishes.
After all, where else in Dane County can you get Albanian sausage.
I asked if the could add it to the Mediterranean Scrambler since my husband was getting the skillet and the waitress was very accommodating.
It was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!
If you love sausage, this stuff will blow your mind.
The copious amounts of fresh veggies didn't hurt either.
With the included toast, it was really filling and a great value.
Filling or not - this brunch so we had to have dessert:) We topped our already glorious meal off with their Black Cherry Crepes.
They have this soft cream cheese filling in them that is just amazing.
I ate as slowly as I could because I didn't want it to end.
I know others have complained about some of the other dishes, but reviews I read on other sites talked about how great it was.
I guess it's all about your personal taste.
I just wish the ENTIRE menu was Albanian so that there was more unique stuff to choose from.
My husband and I were both thrilled and can't wait to try some of their Albanian dinners.
For anyone interested in their brunch, it's served Saturday and Sunday and was pretty busy, but the place is big, so I didn't see anyone wait for a table longer than a few minutes.

Sofra isn't awful but it isn't fantastic either.
I got a sub-par breakfast but would like to try some of their lunch or dinner options before completely writing it off.

Delicious food and friendly service!
The vegetarian platter is delicious with fresh pita, roasted veggies, home made hummus, vegetarian Dolmades and goat cheese!
2nd time here and love it!

The vegetable plate, albeit kind of expensive, is absolutely delicious and highly recommended.
I can't speak much for the rest of the menu.
I ordered the Salad Nicoise and thought, hmm, I can make a much better salad dressing at home, with olive oil and lemon juice - so I took the rest home with me.
With thoughts like that, why bother to go out and eat?

You have to try this place!
I am a fan!
The food is terrific and service is outstanding!!
Driving around after some plans fell through I let my stomach be my guide and wound up here.
As I sat down a woman who I assume is the owner greeted me and made me feel very welcome which was nice because I felt a little out of place going to a restaurant on a friday night alone.
My waitress was also very nice and very genuine.
I ordered the Mediterranean White fish which came in a tomato based sauce that I can not stop thinking about!
Forgot to mention that I started off with a tortilla soup which was surprisingly good for a restaurant that wasnt a Mexican restaurant.
I went for the gusto and ordered a coconut pie for desert with a dessert wine which was a mix of 3 reds and some cocoa.
No complaints!!
Everything was amazing!
I went back a couple of days later and tried the rotisserie chicken with rice and grilled veggies.
Again no complaints.
Amazing!!
That meal started with Albanian soup that was great.
I love this place and cant wait to take the man.
The portions are huge and the plates are filling.

Stopped by for Balkan Night a few weeks ago, which was a special event, so I can't really comment on the everyday Sofra experience-- but Balkan Night was really a blast.
Live music, dancing, and everyone from the owners to the waitstaff to the customers all were having a fantastic time.

I was on vacation in Middleton this week  and my friend that lives there and I were looking for something different to have for lunch.
Sofra looked nice from the outside so we tried it.
I believe the place was recently redecorated because another customer remarked on the removal of some tables and placement of some booths making the place look spacious.
I really liked the decor--bright and modern with a fresh look.
We were a little late so missed a lunch crowd if they did have one.
The place had three senior citizens eating alone reading the paper.
It seemed like the type of place they frequent.
I mentioned to my friend these three seniors should have sat together and made a party of it...  My friend and I both had the Gyro ~ Savory gyros meat, sliced thin and served with onions, tomatoes, cucumber sauce and feta cheese on a grilled pita.
Mine with french fries (hey, i'm on vacation and calories don't count!
) and she had the chicken noodle soup.
Sandwich was very good and very filling.
I especially liked the cucumber sauce that was on the side for us to put as much on as we liked.
My fries were really good but my guess is that they were frozen--the type that are dipped in something to make them crispier.
I liked them but they weren't like fresh cut fries.
My friends soup looked OK--she really liked it.
The soup had large chunks of carrot and celery in a clear broth.
it reminded me of something you might find at a cafeteria.
Not out of this world but good and hearty.
All in all, I would recommend Sofra but not highly recommend.
Staff was very friendly and efficient, prices were reasonable and food was good.
Not the sort of place you would go to if you are looking for a special place to eat but yes, it was good and filling.

The atmosphere and food were fantastic.
The red pepper dip was out of this world.
The presentation and flavor were exceptional.
You're not getting a chain restaurant dining experience when you come here.
You're getting a home cooking family flavor in a modern bistro dining experience.
The price also can't be beat.

Albanian Qebap with wedding soup (fridays for the soup) and a Capital Amber...  At almost every place we go, i will try something different each time (*if we go back) to round out my experience and try to find something i really like...
I don't think i can move past this one the menu; it's really that good.
It was also great to see our server really enjoying that we were loving the food too

This was our first time trying Sofra and I have to say it was a huge hit.
We were seated immediately, even on a busy Friday night, and our server was prompt and attentive.
The menu was short but tantalizing; I wanted to try nearly every item and our server's descriptions of the few we had narrowed it down to made it even more difficult to choose!
My husband had the Albanian Qebap platter and he thought it was out of this world delicious.
Fantastic especially for meatlovers.
I had the chicken medeira plate and it was mouthwateringly delicious.
We had the best service we have had in a long time -- even though our server was new (only been there a week) and was quite busy, he took the time to make conversation with us, check in regularly, and go above and beyond our expectations.
The only reason I am giving this a 4 instead of 5 is because the atmosphere leaves a bit to be desired.
Kind of bland ambiance with an awkward host station that had no seating for waiting patrons.
Other than that, it was fantastic.
We will definitely be back.

This is one place I really miss since moving away from Middleton.
A great variety of Albanian/Greek food.
I ate there at least once a week and never had a meal I was disappointed with.
They  always had  great, homemade soup choices and interesting specials.

Great customer service and delicious food.
Quiet and relaxing atmosphere, friendly staff.
Very reasonable prices.
Perfect place for a family dinner.

Albanian food -- who knew it was so simple and delicious?
I was at the Middleton Library and in search of something that was good and would not make me sorry I decided to eat out.
Albanian sausages.... signs all over saying they were available by the pound..
The best part is their sausages they make by hand and sell for people's tailgating parties wedding etc...  At first I was going to order a Gyro but then I needed to try a hamburger made form this Albanian suage .
So light and delicate lamb/beef mixture but so light and the price was very reasonable for the QUALITY of food.. That is what I was looking for quality.
They changed the name and appearance from a German restaurant a few years back and the food was awesome then !
Little did I know they are the same owners who decided to go back to their Albanian roots !
Jazzed up the place as well..   comfortable contemporary very warm and cozy still.
THEY MAKE THEIR OWN BAKLAVA!!
Delicious coffee I had with it as well...

Delightful little restaurant with amazing service and pretty fantastic French fries.
I'd give a higher rating but I only ordered a blt.
I'll have to try again.

Just ate at Sofra for the first time in a couple years, I think.
It was delicious and the service was as good as I remember.
In years past I cannot say the food was more than just average, but the dish I had today was something I will definitely go back for.
At my dining companion's recommendation, I ordered the Albanian Qebap (Sausages) - All-natural, homemade lamb and beef sausages, grilled and served with scrambled eggs and homemade potatoes, skillet style.
The sausages had a sweet taste with a hint of something familiar that I could not identify (old age).
Normally they are served with fries and Shephard's salad, which my friend had (his usual when he eats here).
Great value for the portion.
Cost us $15 for lunch after tax/before tip.
Service was very friendly and attentive.
It was great sitting out on the sidewalk.
We interacted with many neighbors and friendly faces walking by.
Cannot wait to go back

We love this place for breakfasts and dinner.
Best item on the menu is the Albanian quebabs, which are huge!
They are a beef / lamb mix, so if you are like me and can't enjoy half of what is on a breakfast menu usually it is a great choice,  for dinner, You get six sausages and a ton of fries.
You also get soup or salad.
We usually order the salad, which isn't too special, but is good.
Wednesdays are free sangria nights when you order from the dinner menu.
The only reason I don't give it five stars is because sometimes the service is hit or miss.
When it is the owner, they are fantastic, but the past couple of times it has been general waitstaff, one girl was dressed so inappropriately that my husband couldn't even look at her.
The two outdoor tables do get busy in the summer, and I do find myself wishing there are more.
One thing to mention is don't go in late.
We once went at 8:30 and they wouldn't seat us.
Annoying, but as we have been back so many other times and enjoyed it, not worries.

The food was good, (I had the gyro).
But the reason why it is A-OK was because the waitress abandoned us midway and she just talked to her friends for the last half of our meal.

A wonderful homey aroma as we entered this intimate, casual bistro for a Sat night dinner.
I was thrilled at the prices for the large plates offered!
We went for the Albanian entrees: Chicken appolonia and Qebap (lamb/beef sauages).
The chicken kebabs were so juicy and served with dolmades and a little spinach pie.
The sauages were light if a little salty and came with delicious, crispy french fries sprinkled with feta cheese and  a shepherd's salad - which is vinegar marinated tomatoes/peppers/onions/cucs.
I liked this salad a lot, reminded my of my Mom's cooking.
They have a wide selection of desserts, but I felt like these were not homemade nor traditionally Albanian.
So skip dessert and have an appetizer instead.
They know how to cook their traditional foods for sure.
I will be recommending this delightful little cafe.

My husband and I were looking for something different after shopping in Middleton and stumbled upon Sofra Bistro.
We are glad we did.
The atmosphere is sweet and the service is good.
The menu is interesting; it was nice to have choices that we don't get everywhere else.
On the other hand, I am only moderate in my food adventuresomeness, and I was not scared off by the menu choices.
Meals come with freshly baked olive bread, which is delicious, and an Albanian-style chicken noodle soup that is a little creamy and has a touch of lemon.
I had the beef skewer dinner, and that brought the only negative of the meal: my beef was so tough I couldn't eat it.
After spitting three pieces into my napkin and attempting to cut into several more, I gave up.
The server was accommodating and offered to bring me something else, but I chose to eat the vegetables, rice, and hummus on my plate and leave it at that.
As a result, my meal price was reduced by over half.
My husband's lamb chop was delicious.
I think I just ordered the wrong thing.
We will go back and I will expect to have a delicious meal!

Friends recommended dinner here and we came on Friday night.
It was wonderful!
We had the Mixed Grill Platter for Two.
It had Lamb Chops, Chicken Skewers, Albanian Sausages, Dolma, Hummus, Red potatoes & Fresh zucchini.
The Albanian Sausages are lamb and hamburger made from the family recipe without casings and very tasty.
The lamb was excellent.
The zucchini and petite sweet peppers were grilled and wonderful.
All in all, it was a great evening!

Your typical American family diner with all-American food items on the menu, which is just average tasting.
Great service and very friendly staff.
Booth and table seating available, suitable space for larger groups.

Cute clean and authentic.
Any place with a great breakfast AND mimosas gets 5 stars automatically, but these guys deserve it.
The Armenian sausage is wonderful!!
(Just hope I don't have to breathe near anyone the rest of the day).
The chicken skillet was really good but menu says pulled chicken and it was just nice hearty chunks.
If you like spicy, ask for their crushed red pepper, I almost stole the jar!
It has to be home made as it was better than any I've had.
Worth a visit for sure.

Quaint place to meet for coffee or a meal.
I had the Clam Chowder with my Mediterranean Panini.
The soup had chunks of potato, vegetables and some hearty sized clam.
I really enjoyed the panini, it's refreshing to have just a roasted vegetable sandwich.
I did fight the idea of eating it like a normal sandwich(the veges fell out ..all over the place) versus cutting it up..
I did ask for some mayonnaise in case the goat cheese wasn't making the sandwich, uh...wet enough.
I can't explain how I like me sandwiches any better than that.
The server suggested the Roasted Red Pepper Mayonnaise and it was fabulous.
I really didn't need it that much, in fact, it became a dip for the veges that kept falling out- even when cutting it with a knife.
All in all, I'd come back and order these two items again, but I'm ready to try the breakfast!

Fantastic!
I went here on 4/5/14 for lunch with my husband.
We had coffee to start, which was delicious.
They use their own blend that's locally roasted.
It was just what we needed  for a mid-morning pick me up.
My husband ordered eggs, toast, and their own (delicious) Albanian sausage.
He liked his meal a lot, but my meal stole the show.
I ordered the Beef Skewers entree which consisted of steak tenderloin medallions seasoned with Mediterranean spices and served on steel skewers.
The steak was served with grilled zucchini slices, homemade yogurt-dill sauce, a delicious veggie-rice pilaf, and a side of homemade hummus.
Where do I begin with my praise?
First of all, the beef was **tender**, which was my biggest concern when I ordered.
They asked me how I wanted the beef cooked (medium rare), and then delivered me perfectly seasoned beef with a perfectly pink medium rare center.
The yogurt-dill sauce was great, and I used it as a dip for my meat.
The zucchini was not mushy and had cute grill marks on it.
I don't love zucchini, but I was able to eat a few pieces of it, which is a true testament to how well it was prepared.
The hummus was awesome too...except  that the hummus was sort of on its own, so I ordered a side of pita to dip in it.
The pita was warm and crunchy around the edges when it was served, and it was the perfect complement to the rich and garlicky hummus.
On top of the excellent food, service was extremely friendly, prompt, and the waitress tasked with refilling water and coffee was on her game.
Our glasses never went empty for more than 10 seconds before she was back with a refill.
This was on a Saturday morning after we waited for 5 minutes for a seat.
The place was pretty much at capacity, but the service was still top-notch.
The only negative in my eyes was that the menu is a bit pricey, and the portions are a little on the small side.
I've never been the type of diner to equate large portions with a good restaurant experience, and I have a normal to small appetite anyway, so it wasn't a problem with me.
However, a big burly man might have an issue with portion size.
I also feel the price reflects the quality of the food, and the old addage "you get what you pay for" holds true.
Finally, it's only a couple dollars more expensive than going to someplace like Perkins, and it is 100000000 times better in every way!
Next time you want to go out for lunch or dinner, give Sofra a try.
It's awesome and I guarantee you'll have a great experience there.

My husband and I ate here on Saturday night.
It was the night before Easter so there were not many customers which meant our service was fantastic and we were served super quick!
I had the mojito which they made less sweet for me...nailed it!
We started with the dolmas, which were good but kind of spendy for 4 small stuffed grape leaves.
It also came with this amazing olive bread that was grilled.
Then we both had soup.
My husband had the tomato bisque which was super delicious and I had the Albanian wedding soup.
It had great flavor but the noodles were so over cooked they turned to complete mush when they kit your mouth, that was a slight disappointment.
I would like to try it again to see if the noodles were less cooked if it would be better.
My husband ordered the beef tenderloin skewers, which were over cooked and had a funny taste to me, but he thought they were fine.
I ordered the rotisserie chicken, it came with roasted vegetables, and lemon oregano potatoes and this was amazing.
It was a huge portion for under $13.00 and worth every penny.
We want to give this place another try and next time we might split this dish so we can try a few more appetizers and perhaps a dessert.
So overall it was good but there is room for improvement.

WONDERFUL!
I've never knowingly had Albanian food and ohhhh do I like it!
When I eat something that is new to me I tend to go a bit overboard on the ordering.
As per usual, I dined here by myself (Actually I got takeout.
), and ordered enough food for dinner as well as lunch the next day.
Gotta love having a corporate expense account.
I ordered the beef stroganoff, Albanian wedding soup, dolma, Albanian sausage, and had a free sangria.
Yea, entirely too much food.
The beef stroganoff was great.
Sauce was well balanced for a restaurant stroganoff; however, a little saltier than I would have made it at home.
Nearly perfect ratio of sauce to noodles as well.
I appreciate that.
The soup was... different.
Different than any soup I've ever had before.
Thick, creamy, lemony, with tender chicken, and noodles that I thought were a tad soft.
I should have asked how it was spiced.
The flavor is lingering in my mouth as I write this and it's a lilttle woody, a little earthy, a little bitter, and pretty damn delicious!
I love dolma.
My wife doesn't like dolma like I do so when I have an opportunity to charge an order of dolma to the Fortune 500, I jump on it!
This is one of the better dolmas that I have had, and I've had all sorts from many cultures, both homemade and restaurant made.
I consider myself to be a good judge of dolma, and I consider this to be pretty good.
Texture was perfect: soft, but stayed together for dipping.
Lemony flavors from the slices it came served with (I didn't squeeze any on).
Albanian sausage, this is what everyone on this Yelp page is talking about.
Awesome!
I love sausage in general, so I may not be the best judge of this as I am easily impressed, but I can say with certainty that no one would walk away disappointed in their decision to order it.
On top of all of this, one of tonight's specials was a free sangria with entree purchase.
I enjoyed the sangria very much while waiting for my takeout order, which made the wait time (about 15 mins) pass by very quickly!
If giving half stars were possible, I would rate this place a 4.5.
I'm rounding up rather than down because of how great the people working there are.
Friendly, generous with that free sangria on a takeout order, helped guide me through the order, etc.
