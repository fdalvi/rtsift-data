5$ hot and ready pizza?
Can't beat it!
My son and I love coming here for a cheap meal!
Very clean,polite staff...and you may see a sister wife!

Nice cheap pizza.
Sometimes there's a really long line and sometimes it's not as fresh but hey, $5 pizza.
Can't be too picky.

That 'Combo Mambo' door chime is THE WORST!!!
I had to wait for a Deep Dish pizza at 5:05 pm wasn't this suppose to be Hot & ready??
The wait was fine but that damn door chime has caused me to HATE LITTLE CAESARS!!;!!
10 Minutes of BIte Bite sip sip I'll NEVER TOLERATE THIS AGAIN

The pizza is standard Little Caesars pizza.
Can't complain about that at $5/pizza.
The B grade from the health dept was somewhat disturbing, especially when I see a guy with a huge afro in the back making pizza without a hair net on.
Was totally surprised I didn't find a hair in my pizza.
