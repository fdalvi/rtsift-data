If you're like me, and live at the health club, you know how crucial it is to have a good "go to" cafe.
I happen to be on an extremely strict eating plan, so smoothies are a staple.
Life Cafe makes the best smoothie in town.
I opt for their proprietary "Fast Fuel Optimizer-Vanilla Lite," with peanut butter, banana, and water.
I'm not sure why most places have trouble getting the consistency right, but LC nails it every time.
The wraps and sandwiches are fantastic, too.
Kids will have no problem here, as they have everything from pizza to chicken nuggets to mac 'n cheese.
I'm getting hungry.
See ya!

If its here, it's healthy.
I love that the food is all natural.
