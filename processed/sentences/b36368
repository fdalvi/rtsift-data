I have to start this review by saying that Sarah is the best stylist I have ever been to!
She has been doing my hair for the last couple of years now and I leave her salon glowing every time!
She can do anything requested of her and she always gives great suggestions.
Her salon is located in Old Town Scottsdale, very close to Fashion Square Mall.
The salon is nice, private and very comfortable.
If you are in need of a new stylist or are considering dropping your current stylist, go see Sarah!

Sarah is amazing!
She has never made a mistake on my hair and am 100% satisfied every time she does it.
Sarah has done my hair for homecoming, put extensions in, colors my hair and trims it as well.
The salon is a quiet and quaint atmosphere and super friendly!
Sarah never fails to make you feel welcomed and I reassure you your hair will always turn out exactly how you planned!
I highly recommend this stylist and encourage you to try her out and you will love her!

This was my first visit to Sarah and it definitely won't be my last.
I got a Brazilian Blowout and since I needed a touch up of my color I asked her to do that as well.
My color (highlights) have never looked better!
The blowout was a breeze and I absolutely love the condition my hair is in now.
Sarah is a very personable, efficient, and easy to be around gal.
I know how hard it is to find a good stylist so look no further!
