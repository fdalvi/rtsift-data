Like Stephanie, it was the promise of soup, bread and tea for only £3.95 that attracted me into Cafe Vivo.
I'd been wandering around the Canongate area all morning and I need a bite to eat and as it had been raining on and off, a hot cup of tea was just what the doctor ordered.
It was choc-a-block and I was lucky to get somewhere to sit but I enjoyed sitting near the window, people watching and chomping down my vegetable soup.
Delicious.
I can definitely recommend this as you won't find a better deal in the area if you have a hankering for soup.
Overall, this is a great little cafe with competitive prices and a great range of foods to choose from.
It has a nice, relaxed vibe and the staff are friendly too.
The only downside is that it's very popular so can get very cramped but it's worth it.

A really lovely wee cafe in the old Town.
My husband was taking part in a race in Holyrood Park so we wanted somewhere just for a coffee and cake.
Despite being very busy the service was quick and cheerful and at £2.20 the very large lattes were good value for money.
We shared a piece of chocolate brownie which was excellent.
Nice decor and a great independant coffee shop.
