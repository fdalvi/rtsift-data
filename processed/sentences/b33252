Looking for a QUALITY Leather Theater Group for my home...
I am so tired of those furniture sales people treating me like I am just their next sale - Jodi took her time with me to get to know what I actually was looking for instead of trying to stuff me into a sale.
She took the time to explain to me the difference between bonded: which is EVERYWHERE and REAL Leather.
Knowledge IS power and she gave me the knowledge to make an investment in a beautiful piece at a great price that will last a long time in my home!!
So happy I took the time to shop here!!
NONE BETTER!

bought my leather sectional here a few years back...it is very nice...still looks great...they did not negotiate the price point i wanted, but, i bought anyhow.
The sectional looks brand new!
Has not faded...it was about 4K delivered...but, worth it...i will get probably 20 years from it!!!

Awesome leather furniture but the sales person, Jody I believe.... Horrible.
We decided not to purchase there and went to another vendor who sells omnia leather.
She gave us a price, we went back to order then she jacked it up nearly $1200 and refused to honor the original price she quoted and wrote down!
Do your research, if you want omnia leather, find a different vendor!!!
We did and couldn't be happier!
