Standard quality DQ soft-serve here.
Drive-up speaker needs some help though.

DQ is a great place to grab a dessert and the best place of any of the other fast food establishments hands down.
You have several options to go with, shake, sundaes, cones or my favorite (and many others) the Blizzard!
For those that don't know, the blzzard is ice cream mixed with your favorite topping or candy bar (Oreos, Twix, Butterfinger, Nestle Cruch, M&M's etc).
A real treat!
Each time I've gone, the dessert has always been ready within in a few minutes.
The one time I went through the drive through, we were in and out within 3 minutes.
I typically don't go to DQ to eat a regular meal.
Once in a while I will get the chicken finger basket, which is a few chicken strips, fries, a piece of toast and gravy.
Very Good!
The burgers are ok, but if I was in the mood for a burger, I'd hit another establishment.
Just my preference.

Dairy Queen = nostalgic yum for me.
This location has a drive-thru, which makes it easily accessible nostalgic yum so it's even better than some!
I've actually never been inside.
So, why 5 stars?
They have the star pops when some others don't!!!
Ye-ah!
Also, their pecan caramel chocolate thingy is Packed with pecans.
See ya there!

Service is terrible, kids working here don't care about their jobs and it clearly shows.
The ice cream is just like any other DQ- good but over priced.

My review for DQ?
Yum.

Love this location because their staff is friendly and their service is really good.
Have never had a bad experience with this restaurant.
They are easy to get in and out of and not far from home, which I also like.
I usually come here for desserts and the occasional comfort food.
Their loudspeaker at the order area could stand to be fixed though because at times it's hard to hear, let alone understand what the employee is asking or saying.

I can't believe I'm considered a regular here.
Service is lame to pathetic.
There is no customer service, it's more like a question and answer at the drive through.
Curt.
No explanations.
No apologies.
Nada.
This is what it costs and then the obnoxious and sarcastic "Have a good night.
"  Ya know DQ, I could get a cheaper cone at McDonald's or even better, a frozen custard from Freddies.
And there is Rita's too.
So many more options -it's not just DQ.
Get your stuff together and teach your staff to get the job done and add a dose of common courtesy to the "customer service.
