Possibly the worst customer service I've ever experienced in the Valley.
I had to pick up a prop from this particular store, the salesgirl was not only COMPLETELY uninterested in helping me find the item I asked to be put aside (which wasn't), but when it was time to pay I was pushed aside so she could assist her friend first.
I am 100% about helping local buisnesses however in the case of Dee's disappointing Dancewear?
Never again will they get my dollars.
Order your products online or go to a Capizio store.
Either way you'd get better service at Wal-Mart than at Dee's.

I went here today and the staff helping us was super sweet and nice.
my daughter told her exactly what she needed.
They asked her her height and weight, got her what she asked for and we paid and left.
Was in and out in 5 minutes.

Sales people are snobby and act like you know nothing about dance.
I despise going here to get dance gear.
