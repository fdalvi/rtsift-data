They were our realtor when we bought our house and they are our realtor as we are listing our house.
Marc is our agent.
He is fantastic.
He is knowledgeable and has integrity.
He works very hard to make sure his client's expectations are met, and then he does something else.
He exceeds his clients expectations.
When he came to do photos for the MLS.
he took about 300 pictures to make sure he got the very best images of our property.
Marc recommended an agent in the town we plan to relocate in.
He gave us information on moving companies and also suggested we check out Coldwell Banker's loan department for a home loan.
Marc is the reason I rate this agency so highly.

Dane was very helpful in helping us find the property we were looking for.
He listened to all the requests I had and was always looking for the best deal for us.
Dane negotiated a price for us and got us the price we wanted.
I am very happy with his services and would highly reccomend him to anyone looking for a home.

Coldwell Banker has been instrumental in our transition from Mesa AZ to Sturgeon Bay WI.
Our Coldwell Banker Marc Maryland in Mesa referred us to Doris Bodener in Sturgeon Bay to help us purchase our new house.
She has our best interests at heart.
After several showings and some of repeat showings we finally found our home.
Thank you Coldwell Banker for an outstanding job.
