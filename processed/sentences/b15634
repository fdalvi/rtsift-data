If you are looking for the old school style barbershop where people know you, it is a community and you are not a number, this is the place.
1,  Parking - No issue, small strip mall at the end of Eastern in Henderson.
Ambiance - Inside, it is a mix of old world traditional charm.
Nice heavy wood furniture throughout the entire place, big, comfy barber chairs and simply charming, simple and nice.
Price - Just like all other places.
They have deals for kids during the summer.
Stylists - Here is the key.
Everyone is friendly, casual, professional and seem to be dedicated to the clients.
It is a community and it is a place where you want to come back.
They are all very, very nice.
How - Most of time, you have to make appointment.
I kinda like the let's just go to fantastic sams, great clip and get it done type of thinking, and when I do, I get that type of haircut.
So, I simply get organized, plan out appointments for the kids and get them done on the dates that we make appointments.
Hard to do and very easy to do too!
Give them a call, you will NOT be dissappointed.

Moved to the Las Vegas/Henderson area in May of this year.
Had a hard time finding someone to cut my hair the way I wanted it.
I called Laura at Anthem Hills and she took me right away, as well as my partner.
We were both very pleased with our hair cuts/styling (this is the first hair cut that I have had in quite a while that actually looks good)  but we really liked Laura and were made to feel very comfortable.
I am so glad that I called.
The only thing is that their signage does not pay them justice.
They are definitely more than just a barber.
Laura is a great stylist and runs a full beauty salon for women there.
Prices were exceptional also.
I would definitely recommend Laura and we will always go there for our hair care needs.
Great place and great skills by stylist/beautician.
Also great personality.
Laura has it all going fof her.
Give her a call.

I have been in Henderson since Last May.
Moved from MN.
My partner and I have had quite a hard time trying to find someone who really knew what they were doing with our hair.
Well, we found it in Anthem Hills barber Shop.
It is way more than a barber shop!
Nice atmosphere, friendly,   Nice comfortable chairs.
We go to Laura.
She is a real gem.
Really knows how to cut and style hair.
I haven't had such a good style in years.
I thought they were really going to get me at the cash register, but that was not the case.
Good prices, (not $10.00 like the quick cut places) but not bad at all.
Love, Love Love this place and Love Laura.
Hope you will give her a try.
Also, I noticed some of the barbers cutting kids hair and they are so great with kids.
Great cuts too.
Do give it a try.
You won't be disappointed.
Nora, a loyal customer.
