I was attracted to this Chinese take-away because it was part of just-eat.co.uk .
For the students amongst you, you'll recognize that this is an internet-based way of getting fast food, fast.
Unfortunately, being part of just-eat doesn't mean it's particularly good.
I had sweet and sour chicken (predictable, I know) and it was terrible.
Really gloopy and soggy batter, and the chunks of vegetables were difficult to get around.
The rice was really dry and there was a mysterious meat mixed in it....still don't know what it was.
My friend had Chicken in Sataay and found it gloopy too, she said it was really spicy (which neither of us understood - it's a peanut dish) and she couldn't eat very much of it.
Furthermore, it cost us £21 for the experience!
There are far better and far cheaper Chinese take-aways in Edinburgh!

I went into Chinese Good Food Takeaway when I was in a rush one evening to grab my dinner and I probably won't go back.
I should probably have known the meal wouldn't be up to much when I saw the name - Chinese Good Food - perhaps not the most original of names the owners could have chosen.
The menu was a standard Chinese takeaway menu with a range of chicken, beef and vegetarian dishes.
I had the beef with mushrooms dish which had a really thick sauce and the mushrooms were soggy and had sort of disintegrated into the dish.
The beef was really chewy and stringy - not nice.
As Chinese Good Food is situated in the really student orientated area of Bruntsfield, I thought this place would be reasonably priced, but my meal came to just under £10.
My experience of Chinese Good Food was far from a treat and I next time I will go to the other cheaper and tastier Chinese takeaways in Edinburgh.

You know when your mother tells you if you have nothing good to say about a place you should probably say nothing at all?
