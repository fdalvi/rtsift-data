Miss Trisha is great, but I think Marilyn Bostic is a greedy witch.
She charged two months worth of classes to my credit card because it was expiring that month.
I'm sorry, but her convenience is definitely not worth a double payment.
Anyone who helps themselves to my credit card is vile in my book.
We are back now after a year away.
My daughter missed dancing and the recital.
I hate giving money to this woman.
I'm sure you can find a better deal and more decent people at a different dance studio.

My daughter started dance lessons here when she was three.
This is a lovely studio with a caring staff.
The recitals are beautiful and well-organized.
I would recommend Miss Marilyn's studio for anyone who wants their child to love to dance.

My 2 daughters have been taking dance classes here for about 9 yrs.
Our experience over the years has only been positive.
Before settling on the Ballet Centre, I researched numerous studios, but have always been thankful we decided on this one.
Although we drive further out several times a week to take classes, it is well worth it.
My daughters feel comfortable and the teachers are wonderful.
I have had many conversations with Marilyn and have found her to be warm and compassionate with her students.

My daughter has been taking a class with Ms.Trisha for almost a month now and she loves it.
She has learned so much!
Every week she comes home with a few more steps learned and a ton of confidence!
Now her sister is going to start taking classes too!
Thank you!
