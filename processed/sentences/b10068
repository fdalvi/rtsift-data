I was in a car accident and my insurance Progressive, secured a rental with Enterprise.
When I arrived through the door, I was greeted by a huge smile and very polite Jeremy .
He asked if I was there to rent or return.
I soberly told him that my insurance had called for me.
He perked up and said "Sharman?
"  I was a little surprised..
"yes!
"  he pulled out keys and paperwork that was already completed and all I had to do was sign.
THAT EASY!
I went out to a new toyota corolla, completely loaded... and drove away.
AWESOME service...
