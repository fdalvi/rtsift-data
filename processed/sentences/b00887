Definitely overrated.
The fruit tart and the quiche are good, but some of the other items aren't as good as you'd like them to be.
I guess thats why the one in fashion square closed.
and now in french:  Certainement surestim.
Le fruit au got pre et la quiche sont bons, mais certains des autres articles ne sont pas aussi bons que vous voudriez qu'ils soient.
Je devine des thats pourquoi celui dans la place de mode s'est ferm.

I don't think of this as a French restaurant, like I don't think of Hard Rock as a Rock and Roll restaurant.
Same thing - they are theme restaurants.
It's a subtle distinction, sure, but I think it makes you enjoy what they are doing just a bit more.
First of all, I love the counter service.
Walk up, point to a potato gallet or a yummy looking quiche (No, not that one, THAT one....), put it on your tray, slide down to grab some tomato basil soup, and pay the bill.
That simple.
Slide down a bit more and you'll find the free bread and butter station where they have different slices or rolls, for you to grab as you'd like.
I'm a big fan of their lemonade and I especially love the glasses.
Really nice water goblets.
Tuck yourself into a cozy room or small corner while you eat and you can actually relax.
This isn't cheap though.
Getting everything I just mentioned might cost you $20ish?
I never get it all at once.
They also do actual meals you have to order, they give you a # and then bring it to your table.
You're never going to be blown away by the food, but if you just think "theme restaurant" you might actually enjoy it.

This place is not there anymore.

My mom drove me all the way over there yesterday and it wasn't there.
We should have checked Yelp first.
I looked on their website and it looks like there aren't any in Arizona anymore.
My mom was very disappointed.

Loved this place, to bad they left town.
I love the cafeteria style that almost non existent now a days.
