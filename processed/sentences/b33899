Service was very slow.
Restaurant wasn't very clean.
2 people sitting in the lobby and lots of dirty tables.. One of the employees kids came in and took over the place crawling on everything and was very disruptive.
The fool was awesome and the staff was friendly.

Went to get the D-back special, three of them to go for my family.
Taco Bell wouldnt do it this time, even though they did it every time last year.
Pretty much done with taco bell at this point.
