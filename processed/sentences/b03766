I love this place for getting my son's haircuts.
Yes, the price point is high for a kids cut but that he's sitting in a firetruck chair watching his favorite movie while getting a haircut is well worth it.
And he gets a nice quality cut.

I had never been to this location before, but I'm really glad I went in.
They were able to fix my daughters hair after her attempt at self beautification involving scissors and her bangs and sides.
Ug.
They did a fantastic job!!

The Manager at this location is AWESOME!
I think her name is Diana.
I took my almost two year old buddy K here to get a a trim.
He was NOT happy about being in the barber chair.
Diana was very patient with him, cause it took us a long time to get comfortable.
She made a few suggestions was was able to work her magic and trim his hair while he cried the whole time.
He ended up with a very nice and even haircut.
I can't say enough about how great this place is for little kids.
Another tip, if you are a walk in there might be a bit of a wait.
You can make an appointment as well.
