I really thought those make-it-and-take-it pottery places were a dumb idea when they first came out.
My grandmother had a "real" ceramics studio, and I knew just anyone couldn't walk in off the street and learn to clean and paint ceramics.
Guess you could call me a ceramics snob.
Anyways.
Last year I was in charge of our high schools' all-nighter grad party, and went canvassing the shops in the area of downtown chandler for support.
I was very impressed with Mind Over Splatter -- both with their cheery yellow-walled studio and with the owners, Kelley and Lisa.
They donated several studio fees and I resolved to give them a try.
Now I am a fan.
Mind Over Splatter is a terrific place to get your creative groove on.
Try your hand at painting pottery, or create a one-of-a-kind mosaic masterpiece.
Every Wednesday is "Friends Day" with 2 for 1 fees.
Great for a date or an outing with the kids.

Fun!
I like this place but I think the hours stink.
Since I mostly have time to go in the evening I find myself going to As You Wish more often.

I never got a call that my pieces were ready for pick-up.
The newspaper article said the pieces were at DiSciacca until June 26.
I went on June 19 and they've been picked up.
I have no contact info as the phone and website have been disconnected.
Disappointed, as one was a gift.
