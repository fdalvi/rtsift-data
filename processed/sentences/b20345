Any place that sells red liquorice is a proven winner in my eyes.
True to form, Experience (a somewhat bizarre name for a health foods shop) sells the chewy red stuff by the bucket load and I love it.
Dried fruits and other packets of health food are all here but admittedly I'm only drawn in by the liquorice treats.
In fact I've run out, I'm off to get some!

If you are out and about this side of town and want to pick up a healthy snack then this is the place for you.
Sure it's not as cheap as McDonald's and such, but the dry fruit and nut combo bag will keep you going for a while longer.
They also have a great selection of treats for diabetics and such at various prices.
Keep your eyes peeled for the deals on the door, and definitely worth a trip if you have a train ride ahead of you and want to avoid the over priced food trolley.

When I first found this shop I thought it was rather bizarre and they have so much health food it made my head hurt.
I like being healthy but dried bananas really aren't my bag and the prices for such items are usually extortionate.
Thankfully they are very reasonably priced at Julian Graves so if you're looking to shed some weight or are just feeling guilty about eating unhealthily   On my last visit I bought a large bag of licorice and some fat free rice crackers to nibble on for the train journey home.
Delish!
