I have two children and a third on the way.
I consider myself something of an expert in the professional fleecing that is the modern soft play centre and this is not a good one in my opinion.
It's large (hard to find your kids in) and it's not clean.
In fact it smells bad.
Like dirty socks.
The toilets are not clean and the food is both overpriced and nothing special.
It's out at the back of beyond and not easy to find in an industrial hinterland and it's expensive.
You get better value for money elsewhere.
