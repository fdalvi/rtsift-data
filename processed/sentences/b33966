This is a Starbuck's located inside Von's.
It is owned and managed by Von's.
Plenty of help and seats.
Very convenient for a caffeine boost  when I patronize this Von's or I am headed southeast.

An iced Cafe Mocha with an extra shot is the same in Topeka as it is here.
This location gets 4 stars based on service.
It's service that's fast and without attitude.

Starbucks is starbucks.
I have always had great, quick, and friendly service at this location which inside the Vons on Horizon Ridge.
It is located right by the door so I can quickly stop in and get a coffee even if I am not going in to shop.
Keep up the good work!

Moving across the street and putting in a drive-through window was the best decision this Starbucks location ever made.
I love how convenient it is to get a great cup of coffee now.

My girl friend and I are pretty much regulars at this Starbucks because it's convenient.
Now that they have hired a new staff they continue to mess up on every coffee we get.
Either it's too sweet to melted or tast like they pored a whole bag of chocolate powder in it.
Absolutely disgusting.
It's a waist of money and I would not suggest this Starbucks to anyone!

Staff is kind.
For a bunch of teenagers, I'm impressed.
They made my drink efficiently, even though I'm sure I heard some gossip  about "being thrown under the bus" and "quitting or getting fired".....
But, not bad.
I'll be visiting when I am in Vons.

I was a total klutz and spilled my drink all over the floor in the checkout of Vons.
They were super kind and replaced it at no charge!
