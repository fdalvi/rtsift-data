Great place to try out baby carriers and find your best fit with knowledgeable staff.
They have classes and lots of great baby supplies of high quality.
Lots of Dr. Seuss stuff right now!

I was hesitant to buy my cloth diapers here...
I assumed that because it was a brick and mortar store, I'd pay a premium for things I could easily find online.
I am happy to say I'm a convert.. not only are they staffed with friendly, knowledgeable staff, but they are very helpful, have never ever been pushy and best part?
Their prices are great - seriously!
comparable to amazon on several occasions.
Now, I happily go here when I need any stock or extra supplies of cloth diaper items... their 'house' brand, Bumkins, is now my favorite!
Beautifully sown, great quality, hold in all my son's fluids and they are a great value!
The owner has been there on several occasions and is a bountiful source of tips, tricks and lots of diapering knowledge.
I think this is truly as good as it gets!

I will be honest, I have yet to buy anything from here but went in to check it out and get some information on the classes they offer.
The store was adorable, the staff was  friendly and helpful, and I will be back to buy pretty much everything when it comes time for baby #2.
This is the place to go if you have any questions on aspects of being a 'crunchy' momma.
So awesome!
Every pregnant woman should go here at least once to check it all out!
