AWESOME!!
Don't Replace your AC till you check with TNA.
Tim was AWESOME!!!
*** $19.99 ** second Opinion!!
Other Large Company came out and claimed "Drawing High Amps" "Low on Freon"...Expensive temporary repairs OR change the Whole unit!
A "Deal" was offered on the Whole unit and it was still high priced.
Tim showed AMP Draw was NORMAL..NOT HIGH DRAW!
Also a leak was soon discovered under the Freon checkport.
IE .. Other Guy NEVER even check Freon or he would have stated the Leak.
TNA Offers $19.99 check, Great for a 2nd Look before you commit to a full change out.They can usually fix it and R22 will be around for years Though price is going up.
Full install from TNA also $1,000.00+ cheaper than those others!!!
Whats $20 for a second opinion...That's 10 min on the Slots!!
You can always go back to The More Expensive Company if you like!
Call Them NOW!!

Great customer service and definitely affordable .
My AC system died on Saturday night on hottest weekend of the year last summer ( 2013) ... 117 degrees.
I called Sunday morning and they were able to  get a new 5 ton 13 seer unit installed the same day for $2595...$1000 less than competitors with a much better warranty .
Then they sent another tech out today (Monday) to make sure it was running properly.
You can't live  in Las Vegas without AC and I think a lot of companies take advantage if that.
I'm happy to say that TNA isn't one if them... 5  Stars!!

Ok so it's 8:00 PM on a Tuesday and it's 85 degrees in my house.
I call a couple of places and one says they can come in the morning.
The other says not until Friday.
Not good.
I call TNA and get an answering machine.
I don't leave a message because I need to get someone out quickly.
A few minutes later the phone rings and it's TNA apologizing for missing my call.
I tell the lady what's going on.
She asked where I live.
She says she has a repairman in the area on a call and can come to my house next.
Derek arrives at my house around 10:00 PM.
He assesses the problem as a slow refrigerant leak.
He, unfortunately, didn't have any sealant but could at least refill the refrigerant.
I asked him to go ahead and do that since it was late and my house was too warm.
$200 and my house is cooling off.
He was here for about a half an hour.
I'm happy with the service I received from TNA.
By the way they only charge 20 bucks to come out and look.
Far less than other companies.
I will definitely recommend them to family and friends.

We were melting , even my cat was having trouble breathing ^&^ ~ .
Our air went out and I just kept seeing the inside temp approaching 90 degrees!
I put out a facebook alert for an HVAC person STAT !
Boy Ill tell you , the minute I called there offices and Arti answered , I knew I was in good hands.
Ive heard horror stories of people waiting up to a week , sometimes two just to get someone to take a look.
TNA was there in 45 minutes.
Not only did they take a look , they brought a solution.
They had the parts right on the truck and had me up and running in no time.
Thank you so much !
It is rare to find a company that provides such great customer serv ice and quickly too.
Thank you agin.
And my cat thanks you too.
Now , if i could judt get the icemaker in the fridge to work and my drivers side door lock to be unjammed , Id be a happy camper.
I will refer you to everyone I know .
Thanks , Thanks, Thanks
