I have the number for this take away programmed into all our family phones.
I've used this takeaway for at least 30 years.
It's a family run business that has been in the same family's hands since the 1970's.
They have one of the most extensive menus of any Chinese take away that I've used.
Their Cantonese duck is fab and their garlic chicken is just yummy.
I always get free juice and at Christmas a calendar or biscuits.
They do deliver but I prefer to go in and collect my dinner and have a wee chat with one of the Lee family.
