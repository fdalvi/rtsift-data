Misdiagnosed an engine issue.
Didn't refund money...continued to look for the issue and kept the cash.
Came up with an estimate of TWICE price of what was actually needed to fix my problem.
Offers hard cookies and coffee while you wait.
If you need work done on your Chevy, I'd recommend Ballweg in Middleton.
Better stuff to eat while you wait, internet and computer stations to play on and coffee, soda, water, hot chocolate.

I love working with Zimbrick!
Love my new Equinox!
Awesome team over at Sun Prairie...everyone was incredibly helpful!
Thanks so much!

Limited selection and condescending, immature salesperson.
