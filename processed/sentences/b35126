Great friendly staff.

Sitting here now, 30 minutes after my appointment was suppose to have started.
I get here about 10 minutes till my appt.
starts.
There's no one at the desk.
Just an elderly couple also waiting who seem pretty agitated.
I'm assuming they've been waiting for a long time, especially when the man turns to his wife and says "this has turned into a waste of my time".
They don't even have their tv on, and someone finally came out 20 minutes after my appt and noticed us 3.
Didn't say anything to me, took the couple back.
I was eventually told just a few more minutes.
It is now 50 minutes after my appointment.
I am clearly agitated.
Don't go here if you have anywhere to be.Update: That poor elderly man of the couple is very angrily yelling at the dentist.
Apparently Dr.Do is created a problem in this man's mouth.
And made things a lot worse.
After that they of course charged him up the ass for.
It makes me sad actually you can hear the stress In the mans voice.
Will never ever go back here again.

I have been going here for 4 years every time I come they are not busy & get me seated right away the office is very clean & nice the staff are very friendly & professional doctor do is one of the best dentists I have met very gentle & understanding!
