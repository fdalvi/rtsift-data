Went here years ago for lunch, and it wasn't bad.
It wasn't very memorable either.
I would compare it to a ghetto Outback.

on our 1 trip to lonestar the service was lousy, the food sucked-we ordered the delmonico ribeye & baby back ribs.
everything was tough & cold.the bleu cheese wedge was wilting & dressing was watery.we had the texas rose onion for an appetizer it was very greasy.
after our waiter never returned we tracked down the manager who begged our forgiveness & apologized.
they gave us the "meal" for free & a voucher for another "free" meal if we would return.
2 months later when we decided to give it a go it was boarded up & closed.
coincidence?
