Just as the previous reviews go, very friendly staff and willing to work with our schedule.
Dr. Weisner is my chiropractor and he has worked wonders on my back since my first visit.
Tammy and Waleen are very nice ladies that go the extra mile for the patient.
So lucky to have found this office.
I always talk this office up to my friends

One of the best Chiropractors in Las Vegas,   Not only the best chiro but the best boss.
Miss you Dr.
Sincerely,  Norma
