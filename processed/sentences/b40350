Recently we had a few make up lessons at Aqua Tots on Friday Evenings.
After the swim lesson, we've stopped by to get some Gelato.
We've been there 4 times now.
My daughter loves the strawberry and eat the whole cup.
She's 2.5.
I also enjoy the flavor.
There are many standard fruit flavors and chocolate varities and some unique flavors.
I personally like Death by Chocolate and any of the fruit flavors with the exception of the blackberry merlot.
Staff is friendly and always willing to allow multiple tasters  A nice treat to end the day.
I just wish they had a location closer to where I live.
The location could be better because if you didn't see the van towards the street or knew this shop was there you'd have no idea unless they hope to just get traffic going to the other shopping/restaurants/school.

7 mins before they where closing and the open sign still lit, we where walking up to go buy some gelato.
One of the workers locked the door right before we could open it, and walked off.
We wont be back!
That's bad service!!

Gelato 64 was pretty good in my opinion.
They had a decent selection of flavors (however my personal favorite at most Gelato places, pistachio, tasted more like almonds).
Many of which were more "natural" sounding than some of the other places I have been.
The worst thing I have seen at other Gelato places is having flavors like Cotton Candy, Capt'n Crunch etc.
If I wanted flavors like that I'd grab regular Ice Cream.
The only reason why I'm dinging this place is some of the flavors like Pistachio seemed to have very little Pistachio flavor, and for the price they charge I expected more flavorful gelato.

Although this is not the world's best gelato, it was pretty tasty and a nice little treat for my kids.
The staff member was kind enough to split the smallest size in two for them, as they don't need a whole bowl themselves.
The grapefruit flavor was delicious.
Some of the others were little sweet for me.
