When I went into Fraser Heart to get my friend a 21st present, I thought it was quite normal to ask for help and advice about what to buy.
But I was greeted with a disgruntled 'I'll be with you in a minute' and ignored for about 20 minutes!
I managed to find something by myself, but it took a further 10 minutes to organize the order and get my details down.
I left feeling a bit disappointed with my visit, but hey everyone has bad days - right?
When I went back to collect said same present I was greeted with the same I-can't-be-bothered dismissal (by a different member of staff) and once again I left feeling really disappointed with the service I received.
Ok, I understand that everyone has bad days, but it wasn't just one person and it was on more than one occasion.
When I mentioned this to a friend they said they felt the same.
I love shopping, and I love chatting to the employees to get their opinion, but I was totally alone in this decision.
Their jewelry is nice, your bog-standard sets, and to be honest I'm not planning on returning.

Ok, so I was a bit mean to start with.
The staff were extremely rude, yes, but let's look past that.
The jewelery they sell is  lovely, you can't really hate everything in this store.
They stock Thomas Sabo, Calvin Klein, Hot Diamonds, Raymond Veil and so much more.
You can't help but browse, especially since it's located on one of the best spots on Princes Street.
Ok,it's alright...I s'pose.........
