Katherine was amazing friendly and helped us pick out a cute outfit for Baby C to have his photo taken in!
She has a very organized store and we look forward to returning!

Perennials is the BEST!
I have been to her store several times to do my school shopping for my 10 and 13 year old boys.
They love her selection and thoroughly enjoyed shopping in her store.
The owner, (Katherine) and her sister are awesome and make the experience FUN!
Katherine made the boys feel very special and catered to them as though we were in a very,very high end store.
Exceptional is all I can say.
When you walk in you feel as though you are home and walking into your own closet.
Thank you for being there and we will see you soon.
Sincerely, Brenda

Love this store.
It is very clean (all clothes are washed and pressed by the owner).
A lot of care and thought is given to the merchandise...unlike consignment stores they buy items outright from sellers and take pride in their offerings.
They are more than willing to look for items not currently in store for special requests and care about your experience.
Highly recommended especially in comparison to some of the other stores I've seen recently in Phx.
