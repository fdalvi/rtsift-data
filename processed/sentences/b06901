Twice I have entrusted my 1964 Martin D18 to Lane's and both times the work was top quality, done quickly, and reasonably priced.

I own more guitars than my S.U.
likes and they will need attention every now and then.
There aren't that many guitar shops in Madison that do decent repair work, some don't do any.
When I moved to town a few years back, I did the rounds to check them all out and two stood out..,SSM on Spruce Street and Lane's Lutherie.
I recently traded my archtop electric for another one and it had developed an annoying buzz whenever I played an F#.
Turns out Lanes Lutherie sells the brand so they were the obvious choice.
I got an accurate "sounds like hardware problem rather than a fret problem" and an  honest "we'll check it out, these things can be hard to track down" statement from the luthier at the desk.
4 days later I get a call that it's ready.
Turns out there was a tiny gap between the floating pickup and the neck that would only vibrate at a sympathetic frequency.
I don't know how they figured it out but they did, they fixed it quickly and, for less than $20 I had my guitar back.
Nice job gentleman!
