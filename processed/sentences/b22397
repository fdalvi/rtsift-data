I love this place and their $79 iced teas.
The staff are always so friendly even when I'm grumpy and half retarded from my hangover.
:) I always find what I need there except for hard liquor.
Why no carry?

The guy at the counter made me break a dollar to pay the penny when i pumped $30.01 This jerk made me sound like one of those janitor's with the huge key rings with all the change in my pocket because he wouldn't let me slide on one red cent.
TOTAL DOUCHE!!

Stopped by this convenience store to pick up some Candy.....yes, I had an urge to splurge.
I rarely eat Candy....the sweet tooth was calling that day.
Of course, I had to get my Trolli Worms and Kit Kat.
Cashier guy was friendly.
What more could you ask from a neighborhood convenience store?

Working the graveyard shift in old town has to be one of the most awful jobs around.
After all, you get to deal with the drunkies all night long.
The folks that work those grueling hours though are always upbeat and super friendly.
I always leave here laughing.
