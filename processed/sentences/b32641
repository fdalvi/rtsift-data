Nice friendly staff, I definitely recommend if you need some custom orthotics, or the right fit shoe!

While the shoe quality is excellent, their ordering practice is extremely poor.
Two pair of shoes were ordered on 12/30/13.
Three calls were placed after assurance of delivery on 1/3/14.
I was told bad weather, death, very busy time of year, lack of help....
I was told the order was not placed until 1/6/14 on 1/14/14.
Plenty of opportunity was given for this company to fess up and simply state they were incapable of processing the order in a timely manner.
I was offered a refund.
Another irritating factor,   Foot Solutions processed the credit card immediately on 12/30/14.
Unfortunate they were not as speedy on delivery.

Staff is very knowledgable about their products and what shoes will fit my lifestyle.
I always walk away satisfied and with shoes that are perfect or me!

My children have talotarsal dislocation, and it is critical we have them in properly fitting shoes.
We've tried the pick off the rack shoe stores, but they don't provide the right fit.
The team at Foot Solutions did an amazing job of getting both kids in the right shoe and gave us options we wouldn't have thought of to ensure both children got the proper fit, as well has having shoes their friends think are "cool.
"  Thanks to Al, Lynelle, and Patti at Foot Solutions for your help and creative solutions!
