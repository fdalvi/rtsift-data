I purchased my first pair of authentic cowboy boots here!
I walked in and was welcomed by the smell of good leather.
At first I thought I may have been out of my league as I passed by $1500 mens boots, but I breathed a sigh of relief as I perused through the womens department.
Needless to say , they have a boot to fit your budget.
There was one lady tending the register,  and many of us in the store.
When she was available, she made sure she answered any questions that I had.
In the end, I  walked away with a sweet pair of Mahogany red/brown Tony Lama cowboy boots.

gotta love the smell of leather

Just bought a pair of boots at Sabas and had great service.
Very knowledgeable lady helped me.
