Same deal, same review.

Rarely delayedr egardless of the airport, free bags, no charge for schedule changes.
How flying should be.

Southwest airlines has a horrible credit voucher policy.
PLEASE BE AWARE ANY FUTURE TRAVELERS.
I spent 100 with them about 2 weeks ago and they  refuse to give me credit back to spend on a future flights.
They say that because I used old credit worth $59 with them from a year ago the $100 I spend recently will expire on the same date.
What kind of company does that?
Do clothing companies at the mall say you can't return clothes because you've used credit?
That makes no sense, it's closer to robbery.
I used to be a loyal customer, but I will be flying Virgin Airlines to Las Vegas from now on.
