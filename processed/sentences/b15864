Slurpees are always in top notch condition here and plenty of coffee in the morning, including the delicious blueberry coffee they have been brewing of late.
Plus friendly staff on top of it, one of the best 7-11s in town.

I often stop here for my coffee on the way into work and to get gas.
Service is usually fast and friendly.
They have a fairly regular staff here who all know what they're doing.

Hot day, no water in the car and basically hungry and thirsty and there's good ol' 7-11 with the usual assortment or drinks and snacks, etc.
water, granola bar and I'm out in 3 minutes!

I come here during my lunch for a small snack or drink.
Its quick and convient for me since I go usually during my lunch.
The staff is really nice.
As soon as I walk in they always greet me with a smile.
