For some reason I either seem to have bad luck with phone chargers or they just aren't made to last that long.
I've had to replace a charger for my phone about 5 times now.
The last time I was in there I personally thanked them on how great their customer service is everytime I am in there.

Kevin is awesome!
(And a Brooklyner.
) Thanks for hooking my husband and I up with iPhones!
They are truly the best.

Leti gave me an amazing service!
She is very knowledgeable and she doesnt believe in impossibles.
Whatever you want she will try her best to make it happen.
I went a couple of other times and they are all nice and helpful.
The people on this store have grest costumer service.
