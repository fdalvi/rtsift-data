A top notch club that doesn't rob you at the door in cover charges and then at the bar in drink prices!
They offered free cover and the drink were very reasonably priced at $7 domestics, $8 well drinks, $9 mid, $10 top shelf and they also offered a local discount on top of that as well as bottle specials..
I'd recommend this club to anyone looking to have a epic night out, they have great staff with beautiful entertainers that will give you twice the service for half the cost

Well managed, great girls, great DJs, great specials!
Thanks for the generosity!
Certainly be back!

This club is awesome,  free cover, $1 well drinks and domestic bottles of beer along with half price on the rest of your drinks till 8pm daily along with some of the hottest ladies I have seen at the Vegas clubs during the happy hour shift.

This place is a joke.
There were a few girls dancing who looked like they were high on heroin or meth.
The drinks were way too expensive!!
I would rather give my money to the homeless then this so called gentlemens club.
What a waste.

EXCELLENT ESTABLISHMENT!
The managers and staff are very respectful and tend to your needs immediately.
Girls are friendly and clean and locals get treated very well here.
Better than the gentleman's clubs out east with what I am used to!
