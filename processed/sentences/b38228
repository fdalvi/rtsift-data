Great people at the window.

This post office is just a few minutes away from us and it's always a joy to come here.
People at the windows are courteous and welcoming and they always have great advice on how to save you money when sending stuff to loved ones.
It's hardly ever busy and there's plenty of parking.
They take card and cash and will leave a smile on your face.

Worst post office ever!
I called looking for a package that should have been delivered and they were not even slightly helpful.
The 'delivery supervisor' was exteremly rude and kept placing me on hold before letting me get my story out.
When I requested to speak with a manager, he told me he was it and I'd just have to wait for my items.
I know it's impossible to work with another office as delivery is based on your address but try anything before you call them!
