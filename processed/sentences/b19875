After having a good experience at David Bann's my vegetarian friend asked me if I wanted to check out Black Bo's.
This dinner left me just as full as any other night after I have finished a great steak.
Being a meat-eater I would consider converting if I could eat at places like this all the time.
Small and cozy, the place is unimpressive when you walk in however, stick with it.
The food was amazing I started with a vegetable stir-fry crepe with melted brie and cranberry chutney.
Then went on to have mushroom and pecan balls, filled with garlic cream cheese, and served with a pineapple chutney.
It was to die for.
My biggest disappointment of the night was not having discovered this restaurant sooner.
Great prices overall definitely worth it, even for those meat- lovers out there.

Oh.
My.
Lord.
This place is amazing.
And amazing might even be an understatement.
I know a helluva lot of vegetarians and vegans in Edinburgh.
Edinburgh's actually a pretty decent city to be ethical about your eating habits.
Most places either have a vegetarian/vegan option or are vegetarian/vegan.
I heard about Black Bo's through a militant vegan friend of mine who spends most of her time planning her next meal.
She's a fan of food, she is.
So, when my parents ventured upon Edinburgh, I decided to take them there.
It's useful having them around, you see.
They feed me very well.
This is a relevant fact: my father, if he could, would be a pure carnivore.
The thought of eating at a vegetarian restaurant did not appeal to him at all.
Let's just say, he left real happy.
The menu at Black Bo's changes pretty consistently.
The first time I went there I had some sort of heavenly stuffed aubergine.
I can't even remember what most of the ingredients were, but they made my taste buds tingle.
The day I finished my last exam, I went there with a few friends and I had some filo pastry thing filled with pistachios and asparagus with grapes sort of just strewn about the plate.
The grapes were a brilliant idea.
Seriously.
Rumour has it that they once had a meat option (see, they were getting back at meaty restaurants for always having a vegetarian "option"), but no-one ever ordered it, so they scrapped it.
Yes, meat-eaters out there.
Vegetarian food can be good.
I'm not much of a food critic, but I know when food makes me happy.
And this food makes me very happy.

The neon sign kinda put me off a little bit, but I always heard amazing things about Bo's.
I struggled too at first with the idea of going to a vegetarian restaurant - I like my meat.
But I was pleasantly surprised!!
The pasta was delicious - I just knew it was too good and I would have to slog it off at the gym the next day.
But tasty doesn't quite give it justice!!
The place itself doesn't excite me too much, but it's nice and a good place to come for vegetarian friends.
Definitely one to keep in mind.

My daughter and I were in Edinburgh in October and had dinner at Black Bo's.
This place was such a pleasant surprise.
We felt so welcomed, so relaxed and the food is excellent.
It's quaint, warm and delicious.
I look forward to returning.
Try this place, I am sure you will feel the same way.

Words cannot describe how fantastic this food was!
This place lives up to all of it's reviews.
Phenomenal vegetarian and vegan food that most meat lovers would love.

By the looks of it this place is under new management.
As a result the range of drinks stocked is less comprehensive than it used to be and the decor's gone rather minimalist & sterile.
Not sure that the bistro is any longer vegetarian either.
