This QT, like nearly every other I've been to, is great.
Helpful staff who run two registers at once so you never get caught behind someone cashing in, then buying, a hundred scratcher tickets.
Hallelujah!

I love all the QT locations.
It is so nice that every time you do in you are greeted with a "hello" often by more then one employee!
They all are friendly and have a smile.
Transactions are fast since 1 employee will be handing 2 customers at once... this is awesome multitasking!
I love that all the QT are set up the same and all have the same products.
I know what I can get when I go in and know where to go for a quick trip.
Large selection of drinks is an understatement!
Prices are reasonable for a gas station and have great deals sometimes like a free donut with your coffee.
Bring your own cup in for a cheaper price on the fountain drinks.
Always very clean and well kept.
The bathrooms are kept clean and have more then one stall.
This is very important to my husband who does a lot driving for his job.
They always welcome him even if he is there to go potty.
It is this attitude in regards to their bathrooms that keep him coming back to them when he needs gas and other items while on the road not just to potty.
Little things go a long way.
Many gas stations frown upon drive by potty people.
QT knows to treat all people with respect and they will be loyal and return to them for all their other needs!

I LOVE QT's!!!!!
Why settle for Circle K (B Lister) when you can go to the QT (A lister) right across the street?
QT = Quality Time
