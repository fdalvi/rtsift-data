If its 4am and you're hungry from the nights activities this is the place to go!
I usually have the chille relleno burrito but my friends go after this thing on their menu "adobada".
Right after they order it, you hear them say that word over and over again.

Oh, Felipito's how you've come to my rescue time and again!
Do NOT eat here if you don't appreciate a good measure of grease with your Mexican food or if you're squeamish about ordering out of a food hut.
But, let me tell you, that will be your fault because no one has Felipito's beat for Mexican fast food.
Not even that other place.
You all know the one.
First of all, the 24 hour drive thru is an absolute godsend.
3 AM burrito cravings are strong, unignorable, annoying things and Felipito's will satisfy that quickly.
Everything here is freakin' yumtastic, and they even give you enough salsas to keep even the biggest sauce fiend happy.
Once, my friend Pouncy and I shared such a delightfully greasy quesadilla that we had to actually wring it out and thereby invented the Felipito's Wringing Out the Quesadilla dance, a gyration that's remained popular for over three years now.
Any place that incites such a lasting movement surely is worthy of a visit.

Looking  for a burrito in Las Vegas?
I found this Mexican drive through that is open 24hours when vacationing there.
Try the Super burrito with everything or the steak and egg.
These people make burritos for people who are hungry.
I ordered two and the bag weighed about three pounds.
The price is low less than four dollars a burrito and others less then three.
Also if you are a seasoned burrito eater you will appreciate that this place can roll a proper burrito that will not fall apart on you.
These were tight and stuffed.
I had a poor chicken burrito on a subsequent visit but the steak and egg was still awesome.
The salsas provided are to be avoided as they are dismal.
No chips come with burritos here so if you want them ask.

I wasn't sure whether to give this place a 3 or a 4, but went with the 4 because there weren't any negatives strong enough to offset the positives.
I had the chile relleno plate, and the chiles rellenos themselves are worthy of a full 5--the batter was light, the chiles were pasillas (not ortegas), the pico de gallo on top was beautifully fresh.
What brings the food rating down a bit are the salsa roja, which was quite bland, and the beans (I didn't bother--seldom do--to try the rice) which were also bland and garnished with shreds of mild cheddar cheese instead of tangier grated cotija cheese.
The order came with 4 thick, griddle-browned corn tortillas, which could only have been improved had they been hand-formed and made fresh less than an hour ago.
For machine-made tortillas, they were excellent.
For those of you who are extremely hungry and close to broke, you will appreciate the huge portions and low prices.
The atmosphere and decor are nonesistent; there are a few tables outside, pigeons roaming in search of crumbs and the traffic on Tropicana rushing by.
Felipitos is open 24 hours.
Reduce the rating to a 3 based on my most recent meal--a fish taco was truly uninspiring (but adequate--fresh radishes were a nice touch, but couldn't make up for the tough, coarsely breaded fish and bland sauce), and a quesadilla suffered from too much and the wrong (cheddar--should have been a mix of a mild Mexican cheese like Asadero and something dry and sharp like Cotija) cheese.
The only completely right item was the Jamaica aqua fresca--plenty of flavor, but still refreshing.

This place has all the requirements necessary to be your typical drunken food stop.
Open 24 hours, 2 drive thrus in which one isn't even used, located in a sketchy area of town, a less than stellar facade, lighted outdoor seating, and a walk-up window.
Come to think of it, this reminds of quite a few taquerias in SoCal.
It's a bit of a drive off the strip.
If you're picking up or dropping off someone at the airport, this place is not that far down Tropicana.
If you're coming from the eastern part of town and you're on the way to the Strip while craving Mexican food, you may see this and consider stopping.
I ordered myself a carne asada burrito at midnight, and it was only 4 bucks.
Sounds about right.
Then, as I was eating it at home, I realized why it was only 4 doll hairs.
For one, it did not include rice, beans, and sour cream, which I enjoy in all my burritos.
I should have added that on.
Damn.
The burrito was basically a load of carne asada, onions, cilantro, and guacamole.
At least every bite of had chunks of carne asada, but then again the meat was a little chewy and not as tender.
The guacamole didn't taste as fresh, and they added a little too much onion.
Best be sure your breath will stank after eating this.
The tortilla seemed like it was microwaved instead of steamed.
The edges were still dry and hard (potential that's what she said?).
Honestly, its a less than stellar burrito.
If I try this while buzzed or drunk, I might say otherwise.
I'll give Felipito's props for being open 24 hours and serving carne asada fries.
Why I didn't try it instead is beyond me.

Now, let me start by saying that Felipito's only seems to cross my mind after having had a few cold ones, but whenever it does, it seems like the greatest idea anyone has ever had.
Felipito's is about as simple as it gets, from the concrete picnic tables to the menu comprised mostly of blown-up pictures and numbers.
But make no mistake: Felipito's is a hidden gem.
From the carne asada plate to the chile rellenos, your drunk ass will actually take a moment from scarfing down the ridiculously large servings to slur, "This is realllllllyy gooood!
" Which, despite your lowered inhibitions and altered judgment, is true.
They've got fantastic homemade pico de gallo (which I recommend ordering an extra side of), as well as handmade (and freshly fried) flour tortillas.
I'm kind of disappointed by the guacamole, which is clearly not made in-house, errr... in-shack, and it's safe to say the carnitas plate will blow your calorie intake goals for an entire week.
But after a few cold beers, who cares, right?
Ladies, I would recommend ordering from the drive-thru late at night.
Dealing with sketchy characters or drunk dude-bros when you're trying to get your grub on can definitely detract from these greasy delicacies.
P.S.
I can personally vouch that the Super Fries will prevent any trace of a hangover.
For about six bucks you get a foam container with fries smothered in cheese, guacamole, pico de gallo, sour cream, and steak.
There is some kind of genius working in this broken down taco stand, I am quite certain.

This tiny scary building is hiding something, kick a** food!
Greasy, fast, cheap and flavor to spare.
You got to love it.
My personal fav.
is the Super Nachos!

I have been here twice within the last 8 years.
The most recent time my friend wanted to go here so bad, and I couldnt remember whether it was good or not which obviously it didnt make a big impression on me.
While driving, I noticed that we passed a lot of little hole in the wall joints I wanted to try.
Nevertheless, my friend was stern on going here.
So we walk up and both place out orders.
He orders a bean and cheese, and carne asada nachos, and I ordered the 5 taquitos (or rolled tacos as the menus says).
My friend is a die hard Albertos fan, so once we came back here I realized that this place is pretty much that except a tad bit better.
I had one taquito and they hit the trash, wasnt feeling it at all.
I actually started to feel bad for the hungry kids of america.
So then I started on the nachos which we shared, and  they turned out to be really good.
The aroma of the surrounding area smelled disgusting.
This is one of those places you go to after a night of drinking, I wouldnt recommend going in the daytime if you are hungry and want some really good food.
When your drunk, this place is probably equivalent to Red Lobster or Claim Jumper.

One of the first places I had ever eaten at in Vegas.
It was goooood.
Get a combo plate with beans and rice.
Watch your back when you walk up to the window at night...And don't feed the pigeons.

Being from San Diego ever time I get wasted in Vegas or  meet up with friends that have never had Carne Asada Fries or a California Burrito, I take them here to try it.
For some reason I don't eat much in Vegas.
I just drink or drink and gamble and I guess I just forget.
But for some reason when I leave the club wasted late at night, I some how remember and have to go to Felipito's.
No matter at what cost.
Most of the time I take a cab there.
One time I made the limo driver go there and pick up some burritos and fries for my friends and I.
Another Time I was to drunk and no cabs would pick me up.
So I deiced to walk all the way from MGM.
Some how I didn't get jumped or arrested and enjoyed my cali burrito.

Felipito's is a good mexican restaurant, but you must know what to order in order to like it.
It's not the cheapest mexican restaurant in town, but there are certain dishes that make Felipito's one of my favorite mexican restaurants in Las Vegas.
One of those dishes is their Carnitas Tacos.
The carnitas is the best meat at Felipito's, but is not just typical Carnitas.
The carnitas at Felipito's is big chunks of fried pork with a little bit of fat attached to the pieces to keep them tender.
I also really like the carne asada quesadilla.
The quesadilla is stuffed with a large amount of cheese and carne asada.
Big portion, and great flavor.
Another item I really like is their crunchy beef tacos.
The crispiness of the tortilla, and the juiciness of the shredded beef go very well together.
One of the main reasons I started going to Felipito's is because it is open 24 hours.
While there are many choices for 24 hour food in Vegas, it is the best option on Tropicana late at night for authentic mexican!

Definitely a step above Roberto's/Alberto's/other 24 hour "mexican" fast food that ends in "O's"  The fish burrito is a highlight.
Surprising, I know.
The battered fish remains nice and crispy, and the burrito tastes nice and fresh.
It is something you can order any time of day and still be able to function after eating.
The carne asada fries are built with some of the best fries I have had at a place known for tacos and burritos.
The portion is enough for 2 to share.
If sloppy, huge portioned Mexican fast food is what you are looking for, I would definitely try here first.
24 hours with a drive through or walk up window for all you night owls.

I just ordered a chimichanga from felipitos.
AMAZING!
I would gladly pay $10.00 for it, but the price was $5.63.
It was humongous!
Chicken in every bite.
If you want authentic Mexican that's inexpensive, Felipitos is the answer.
Update: I've been coming to this glorious 24 hour establishment since the summer of 2005, and Felipito's never fails me, unless it's the sorry location on decatur.
I seem to be addicted to their Carne asada burritos.
95% of the burrito is Carne Asada meat!!
The other 5% is the guac, pico de gallo, and of course the tortilla.
It's all outdoors, so you better bring a jacket if you wanna eat there during the winter.
Another highlight to me, is their Chicken Burrito, not the grilled one, just straight 'chicken burrito'.
96% chicken, 4% cheese and tortilla.
The chicken is always piping hot with the cheese melting.
Mmm it's actually a chicken quesadilla in a burrito but with less cheese, and way more chicken.
Anytime I'm on the eastside of LV, I gotta make a trip to Felipitos.
I'll go out of my way for it too.

Their breakfast burrito is OFF THE HOOK, it is enormous, I had to share one with my 16 year old son.
That in itself is a feat because we all know 16 year old boys can eat, but even this burrito filled us both up.
YUM!

UPDATE:  Unfortunately I must remove a couple of stars after last night's dinner from Felipito's on Trop.
I ordered the Chicken quesadilla again, and although it was still big and chock full of cheese and chicken ... it was surprisingly bland.
Same for the chili relleno chimichanga, which was undercooked and lacking flavor.
Overall, a disappointing dining experience.
I will give them another chance some day, but I am in no hurry to return at this point.
UPDATE:  Returned to Felipito's for their carnitas plate and was quite impressed with the quality, although I did find some chunks of fat here and there.
Regardless, it lived up to the hype.
Felipito's remains my favorite for fast & awesome Mexican food in Las Vegas.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Best chicken quesadilla I have ever had.
Big.
Cheesey.
Chickeny.
Mighty fine Mexican grub.
Can't wait to go back and try their famous carnitas!

We came for breakfast based on yelp reviews.
Place looks a bit run down but breakfast burritos were wonderful and staff were really friendly!

Another Mexican Joint serving the usual affair..
Came here for lunch a few times and realized that there was something unusual about this place in regards to their direct competition such as: Roberto's, Fausto's, Alberto's, Amigos....   What makes this place different?
Their Carne Asada!
It may look like everybody elses but I think their seasoning/marinade has much more flavor and really gets the time for it to penetrate properly.
I've tried the Burrito, Tacos and Plate (included rice and beans).
All were equally Great!
* I usually add 'green sauce' (from the condiment bar), their version here is even better (not watered down and again much tastier) Also, a little squeeze of lime over the meat, wasn't a bad idea at all!
On the Go and gotta Mexifood Crave?
This place should handle it!

I tried the carne asada plate, per Russ V.'s suggestion, and it was really good!
Keep in mind, it's a ton of food.
But so yummy!
And a reasonable price for $7.
Why didn't someone tell me about this place when I went to UNLV?
They only offer outdoor seating and it was a little cold outside so I had to take it to go.
Also, not necessarily the safest location in the world.
I wouldn't go there in the middle of the night by myself.
But I highly recommend it for a quick yet tasty lunch or late night cravings with a group.

Omg Felipito's is my favorite mexican food spot in Vegas.
I've been coming here ever since I moved here about six years ago.
Who would've thought a little shack like spot would be so good.
First thing that caught my eye was the sign, I thought it said Filipino's hahah.
Anyways the food here is sooo good, I usually get the carne asada fries and a fish burrito.
They also carry a wide variety of choices.
Definitely a great spot to hit up, located near the corner of Tropicana and Maryland.
Great place to get more bang for your buck.

Something must have gone horribly wrong since this place was last reviewed, because when I came here the quality didn't match up to past reviews.
I ordered the two beef burrito combo plate and my boyfriend ordered the two carne asada taco combo plate.
My burritos were completely tasteless - the meat had been cooked way too long with far too little spices to the point where I couldn't even taste the meat, only the texture persevered!
The vegetables in the burritos were blanched and equally over-cooked, but had more flavor than the meat (which isn't saying much).
The beans were okay and the rice was meh.
I seriously thought there was something wrong with my tastebuds at first, but I could taste the horchata (which was good) fine and my boyfriend couldn't taste anything in my burrito either.
On the bright side, his tacos was alright.
If you're out late and drunk to the point where it doesn't matter what you're putting in your mouth, by all means come here.
The portions are generous and the prices are decent, if only it had the flavor to match.
What a pity.

I trusted the reviews, and I was very disappointed.
If Felipito's is the best Mexican food joint in Vegas, then you're better off making your food at home.
The only thing this place has going for is giving you large amounts of food.
However, that doesn't matter if there is no flavor to back it up.
Felipitos specializes in BLAND.
BLAND.
BLAND!
I have tried (too grossed out to continue eating) the carne asada burrito and beef taco.
The carne asada burrito was horrible.
The beef had that exact consistency and chewiness of boiled beef.
The flavors were undeveloped and it was grey, not brown!
The only thing I tasted were the huge chunks of onions, that was it.
The meat didn't even have any hint of salt either or any other seasoning.
It was completely flavorless apart from the onions.
The beef taco looked SO GOOD!
It looked crunchy, it was very plump, overflowing with melted mild cheddar.
Very appetizing.
Then I took a bite.
WTF!
Like biting into a rock!
Cheese was tasteless, as expected with ALL Mexican joints.
Isn't it time they start using sharp cheddar?!
The shredded beef was perfectly cooked.
It was tender and brown, but had NO flavor.
NO salt.
NOTHING.
Major disappointment.
Also, their taco shell might be a big health hazard for children.
It can cut your mouth.
I was expecting a gentle crunch like a chip, but it was like biting into those Kettle brand thick potato chips, but about 3x thicker and 5x "crunchier.
"  That's not all too, they also managed to take bland to another level.
The sauces the food comes with: It's just spicy water.
I don't know how it's possible to ruin sauces.
You got spicy green water and red water that looks like hot sauce but it's not.
It's just red water.
I seriously hope this isn't the best place for Mexican food in Vegas.
If it is, then I guess I never liked Mexican food, because I like food that tastes like food.

There is one reason I come here - the carne asada nachos.
OMG.
They are gigantic and smothered with so much yumminess.
The amount you get for the price is practically a steal.
When I get a craving for greasy Mexican, this is the place that hits the spot.
And they totally let you load up on their different salsas, lime slices, etc.
And when you dump all of that on top of the nachos...
It's practically heavenly.

I've been getting to go food from here for years it's on my way home from work!
I have never had a bad order and I like the salsa's too!
It's a must have for my family who visit from CA, they love this place and never leave with out stopping at least once while here.
The chorizo burritos are excellent too large enough to feed two!
I will continue to stop in for some scrumptious take out food.
YUMMY

You can't go wrong with the California burrito.
Besides chipotle my favorite Mexican fast food joints

Garbage, total crap, with absolutely no taste, If you like bland hospital tasting food go here.
no seasonings used, taco was so greasey it turned to rubber, couldnt bite nor chew, the taco shell had been rendered like beef jerkey literally.
Very stingy with the meat, heavy on the cheap lettuce though.
Stay away.
I think some people from California must have started complaining because its all tasteless.
Polite help though

this place is the bomb for a late night sesh.
i've had tacos, plates and wet burritos.
all great.
i recommend getting adobada, since it's delicious and also, the only meat i've chosen so far.
my friend got a carnitas quesadilla last time and she said it was really good, it looked like a greasy-good-time so i'll be trying that one soon.
i usually eat here with two vegetarian friends and despite the bummer that there's only one thing on the menu they can order (vegi burrito) they really like the place.
i will say that the beans here (refried only) aren't bad but i don't think they help the overall taste of whatever dish you get them in.
i always enjoy eating outdoors and being sketched out by the other late night taco seekers who roll through.
the price is right, the location is good and most importantly the food is grubbin'!
solid spot.

The Bacon and Potato Breakfast Burrito is spectacular.
That thick bacon is deli-quality.
You rock Felipito's.
Also, thanks for not charging a surcharge for using a debit card (cough, Roberto's)!

This is hands down my favorite late night, less-than-sober food stop on my way home from a long night of debauchery.
I've been here countless times, but I've only ever had the carne asade burrito, because it's THAT good that I'm not willing to stray from it and try anything else.
The food here is quick, greasy, simple, and satisfying.
It also withstands the ultimate test, going back while sober, where it is equality as delicious.
If you're in the UNLV neck of the woods, don't waste your time on Roberto's, because Felipito's blows it out of the water.

I never would have picked this.
However, I had a dinner to attend with my coworkers and asked my hunny where he wanted me to stop to get him some food on my way home.
Pet Peeve #1: The girl never told me my total.
After she asked me for my payment, I still had to ask her my total.
She told me $16.00 and ran my card.
I asked for an itemized receipt and never got one.
Oops, too late.
Something fishy is what I think.
Pet Peeve #2: I ordered a cheese quesadilla for my son.
I asked if they put anything extra on it.
Was told no.
Needless to say, I wound up with onions on my quesadilla.
My year and half son was not happy and did not eat it to say the least.
The quesadilla was very cheesy, too cheesy almost and was very, very greasy.
It oozed with more grease than cheese.
Thank goodness my son wouldn't eat it, I am sure it would have gave him an upset tummy.
Pet Peeve #3: Too long of a wait in the drive thru.
Sure, me being in a rush to get home to get ready for my dinner was making me impatient but when you go through any drive thru you always expect speedy or speedier service.
I did not get that.
In addition to the quesadilla, I ordered a chicken burrito was just okay per the man.
And I also ordered a carne asada super nacho.
Nothing was super about it and I mean nothing.
The meat was tough, chewy and bland.
And well I didn't make it past that.
No thanks.
All these 4 and 5 stars have to be some drunk posts or drunk eats because a sober mind would not enjoy these foods.

WHAT IS THIS PLACE and WHY DID I NOT TRY IT UNTIL NOW.
I think this is where Jesus gets his Mexican food when he visits Las Vegas (but it is Sin City, so I'm not sure that's all that often).
I don't care that it might one day end up on the Dirty Dining section of the newspaper or the local news.
I don't care that it has no nutritional value and that its ingredients are not top notch.
This place doesn't look like it makes sense until it makes all the sense in the world inside your mouth.
The menu is not high on description, but it is low on prices.
It is not health food, nor could it really be considered nourishment in any sense of the word.
I had the cheese roll ups, which, vegetarians be forewarned, have beef inside.
(Though if you had an aversion to beef, this place might not be for you anyway.
) My friend ordered what I had and a beef taco, and total it was $6 and change.
Fine by me!
Taco Bell sells chemicals for more expensive prices.
I am salivating for Jesus' favorite Mexican food now.
Too bad it is in an awkward part of town for me to get to!

This place is one of a kind!
Yea sure the drive thru takes forever but the price is great and quality is amazing everytime!
Very consistent!
I alwayyys get a breakfast burrito which is so delish n ginormous!!
They have great $1 Tacos on tues..normal price I think is $2 maybe but they are stuffed with lettuce and what seems like extra cheese everytime!
The carne asada fries are huge also!
You will not go hungary eating here thats for sure!
My office is always ordering from there so I know Im not the only one who loves this spot!
And 24 hours is great!
The lady with the bad experience should give it another shot....I really love the portions here and prices are so low.....U rock Felipito!!!

24 hr magic land.
order the CHINA BURRITO with cheese... heaven.
Fast service and it's so damn cheap!!!!

If you're drunk and looking for a cheap late night booze soaker, this is the place!
In my last Felipito's quest I order a cheese quesadilla and a carne asada burrito.
The quesadilla was everything it should have been, crazy huge, greasy and satisfying.
Now the carne asada burrito, well, the first bite was good until you realize the meat is laden with gristle, connective tissue and well to make a short story even shorter, after 2 bites I threw it out.
Props for speedy service and the hot gooey cheese quesadilla!

Total drunk food, haha!
They have cheap, huge portions available 24 hours, which is awesome, and I urge the drunkies to go.
Unfortunately, if you haven't been knocking a few back, this is not a place I would recommend.
(Make that quite a few!
) From the meat, cheese, beans, rice, and sauces,  everything was just so bland!
It was actually shocking how flavorless tgd food was.

Was visting Vegas and wanted real Mexican food which is really hard to find in Hawaii.
The reviews that this place was featured on dirty dines did not deter me - I was going to eat real Mexican food.
I had the burrito enchilada combo and it was 100% amazing.
There was so much food that I had it as a second lunch on the plane a few hours later.
I wish I had access to cheap, good Mexican food!

Quick Cheap and easy!
We go there a couple times a week with work.
Though the rolled tacos seemed to get cheaper in the last few months.
Was my favorite thing, now I need to come up w/something else.
But the price is right for all the options there.

Great prices for the amount of food that you get area is a little sketchy but besides that its a great after hours spot to grab a burrito.

I am hooked on their chicken salad - I get without the chips.
It has lots of avocado and they way they do their chicken, the marination process, along with their hot sauce, makes this a good lunch salad for a reasonable price - less than $5.
The lady always remembers my order - no chips.
I enjoy seeing her friendly smile as I make my way through the drive-thru.

No receipt, wrong change, and the food was awful.
In my chicken burrito, I found tendons, a lot if fat, all dark meet with brown fatty tissues.
Seriously, I hope I throw it up but don't want to taste it again.

It's probably not fair to review a place when I am SOOOO steaming mad!
Maybe I should wait until I cool off before saying something about them.
However, if they deserve the bad review then it's on them.
Allow me to explain:  1.
I am allergic to avocado.
Plain and simple, I cannot eat them.
Obviously this includes Guacamole which is a Mexifood staple.
Now that being said, Mexieats are my absolute favorite so I am extremely vigilant when it comes to ordering.
I always have a local 24hr Mexigrub place I adopt as a favorite and then I FREQUENT said establishment.
I have recently switched jobs (thus location) and have been looking for that place in my new area.
My new job is graveyard shift and I only have a very rigid 30 mins for "lunch".
I read the reviews and was willing, even eager, to try out this place in the hopes that it could be my new Mexistation.
So:  03:45 hits and I clock-out and run out the door, hit the ATM and then proceed to Felipito's.
I order the special which is 5 Rolled Tacos (Flautas) with all the fixins but I state NO GUAC.
I also order the Carne Asada burrito and also voice NO GUAC.
I add a large Horchata and proceed to the window.
Now the window person is a kid, male, maybe 19yo and speaks excellent English with no discernible accent so I assume that there should be no language barrier which can sometimes be an issue for the allergy concerned.
We greet, he takes my money and I then repeat my order to him in an itemized fashion making sure to articulate NO GUACAMOLE after each item.
He states, and I quote: "Yes sir, no guacamole".
I think "cool, we got this".
I wait the 15 minutes (exceedingly long but not abnormal for such places at 04:00 in the morning) and enjoy my Horchata (2 mediums instead of a large but whatever, no biggie).
He then brings me my big'ole bag of yummy and hands it through the window at which point I ask again "NO GUACAMOLE?
" again he states, "yes sir, no guacamole".
I then hurry myself back to work and proceed to the break room to gobble down some Mexilusciousness before returning to my duties.
I open the bag, then the box of Flautas and BOOM, a mountain of guac.
I'm pissed.
I go ahead and open the burrito, unroll it and again a quagmire of guacamole.
Did I have time to return?
No.
Did I?
Your GD right I did!
I was not going to give them the opportunity of redeeming themselves by feeding me nor did I have the time to wait for another round of food.
So I got my money back and left.
I wanted very badly to give the kid an ear-full.
I wanted even more to stuff the guacamole laced bag of death into his smug little pie-hole but I did not.
I took my money and with practiced calm, left (my wife would be proud).
There are a couple of morals here but I will just close with one: If an establishment is so uncaring as to hire someone without a bone of concern in their body then they do not deserve anything but my disdain.
I strongly encourage any of you reading this to move along to a different option.
This place does not deserve your money.
Thank you for hearing me out.

Wow felipitos, I can't believe I'm giving you  2 stars after all we've been through .
Seriously , you were one of my favorite places until you tried ripping us off .
First you make the all day special (5 taquitos with quac, sour cream, cheese, lettuce) 25 cents more expensive AND you give 50 percent LESS meat in it ?
I feel like the taquito was vegetarian.
Sorry but I like meat in my taquitos.
And you think we didn't notice ?
I see you .
I no longer crave your food anymore and I'm ready to try out the taquitos at Roberto's now.
I will always remember how I loved the uniqueness of your little shack and the friendliness of your staff , however I get hungry and Id rather go to a place that gives me a decent amount of meat .
Ta-ta until your taquitos come back .....  :)

Affordable food.
Good selection of traditional style Mexican but in a fast food style.
Open 24 hours (a must in a city where you lose yourself in a casino until 4am).
Drive thru!
Yey!
The rice was well cooked and on the bland side.
Nothing a little pico de gallo couldn't fix right up.
Chips and salsa are spot on.
Beware!
Their green salsa has more kick than most greens.

Felipito's I write this with a heavy heart.
For we had many good meals together.
Lately though, you have not had your heart in it.
My food has not been what I ordered, or if it was almost right, you still managed to mess it up.
It would appear there were some serious changes with how this place was run in the last year or so.
My last few visits left me with many-a-wrong orders and disappointing food.
Last night was the last time I will order anything but rolled tacos from you.
The 'cheese enchiladas' were nothing more than shredded cheese wrapped in a tortilla with some red sauce poured on top, hidden beneath a salad worth of shredded lettuce.
When I order an enchilada, i do expect the cheese to be melted.
Call me crazy, I just do.
The crunchy chicken taco that used to be the subject of many cravings has been ripped away from me as well.
The shells used now seem like they come from a box and by the time I could make it home, just a short drive up Tropicana, the taco that was already broke was so soggy it just disintegrated as soon as I attempted to pick it up.
My heart was so broken, I could not bear to put Humpty back together, just to consume that broken mess.
If you can get the good food back that I grew to love from your drive through, I would love to eat there again.
Until then, looks like I am back on the market.
Any taco shops that have a delicious crunchy taco and enchiladas with melted cheese, hit me up, I'm available.

I had this the other night, and it was pretty damn good.
Its a bonus its 24/7, much like Robertos tacos, but this is a nice change up from it.
I had 2 beef enchiladas w/ rice and beans and two beef tacos.
( I can put some food down) def will be going back since its near the airport where I work at.

I'm so sad to say this because I used to love this place... tonight it was inexcusably terrible!
It was bland, greasy, and not even remotely fresh.
My husband and our roomies food was atrocious too.
Its not often they run into something so bad they won't even keep eating it but tonight it all went in the trash.
They even scraped the crusty bean corner into my plate, didn't even try to stir it, yuck.
Worst carnitas I've ever had, hands down.

I've given Felipito's several tries but when there's Don Tortaco and Roberto's, not to mention Taco Bell and Del Taco, there is no reason to keep going.
My favorite is the carne asada burrito, chock full of meat, for something around $5.
Everything else I've ordered has been blah at best.
They have 99 cent taco Tuesday and they are greasy, gross monstrosities.
I think I lost a tooth trying to eat one.
Their bean burritos are huge but bland.
Their taquitos are lacking.
Super cheap with a convenient drive-thru and open late.

Had the burrito with Guac.
It's great for the price they got a little stingy with the toppings though.
Great place to get your stomach filled with massive burritos

Found this place my last day in Vegas.
Why didn't I find it earlier?!?
It's a drive-thru open 24 hours!
They serve huge portions at cheap prices.
Had a bean, cheese, rice, etc.
burrito, and it was awesome!!!
Half was enough for 1 meal so I saved the other half for later.
I give it 5-stars for being tasty, big and cheap.
It's 20 times better than Taco Bell.
If you're looking for fancy Mexican food, this isn't the place to go.
But if you're looking for delicious, fast, cheap food -- go here!

Went here for the first time today and loved it!
The food was delicious and they had great prices.
It was much better than any other fast food Mexican place that I've been to.
It's not very nice looking or in the best area, but I will definitely be coming here again!
