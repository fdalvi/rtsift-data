The employees are extremely helpfull and friendly.
The store is organized and easy to find items.
Prices seemed to be on par with other stores with similar stuff.
One of the door greaters asked if I was looking for something and instead of pointing or telling me where it was, he walked me back and showed me on the shelf.

Normal place... prices are so-so compared to Dicks.
Better if you have a 20% off coupon that comes onces or twice a year.
That is about the only time I buy stuff here, if I need something.
Otherwise, much better deals can be had online

I love Sports Authority.
They have pretty much everything you can think of here sports related.
You have to make sure you sign up for the League which is a loyalty program that gets you money back.
They always send coupons in the mail so you can almost always get a discount here.
They staff is friendly and helpful.
I always have a good experience here.

I've probably shopped here 10 times in the last 2 years and have always had great service and I really enjoy the selection of women's running and beer-drinking, uh....I mean, yoga clothes.
If I have a return or exchange it's always been taken care of quickly and with a smile.
No complaints.
