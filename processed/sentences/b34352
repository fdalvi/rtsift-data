Long story short, I got a deal on some tickets for Robert Davi (of James Bond and Showgirls fame).
He was performing Frank Sinatra songs at the Venetian a couple weeks ago and it was my first time to visit this theater.
The theater is on the casino floor and near most of the restaurants.
It has a cute old-school marquee as the entrance and like any good Vegas venue you are greeted by a bar the second you walk in.
The theater is a little on the smaller side.
It has a nice, intimate feel and there really aren't any bad seats in the house.
It's a very lovely theater and has a large stage and great acoustics.
Why only three stars?
Well, despite how nice the seats look when you walk in, they somehow change form halfway through the show and become the most uncomfortable seats you will ever sit in in your entire life.
It's quite a magic trick, really.
The uncomfortable seats, coupled with zero legroom, leave you completely distracted from the performance about an hour in.
I couldn't wait for Davi to stop singing so I could stand up and walk around (no offense to Davi).
So, lovely theater with great acoustics but be prepared to do some yoga stretches before and after the show.

This is a small and intimate venue to see a great performance.
There isn't a bad seat in the house.

Not a good showroomif you are in a wheelchair.
My friend got stuck in the wheelchair lift and we never saw the show.
They refunded my tickets for $183 but the billed me for $411.
They admit that this was a mistake but they have not sent a letter to MC and corrected the mistake.
