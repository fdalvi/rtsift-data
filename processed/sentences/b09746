Worst Wendy's I've been to in years.
Slow, poor service.
They couldn't make up their mind at the end of breakfast hours how many people would be allowed to get their breakfast orders, and who would be forced to change orders to lunch.
Total incompetence here.

Sometimes I work in the area and this is really convenient.
There are not many fast food places along Carefree Highway, and this Wendy's is new and clean.
I've gone inside and through the drivethru, and my order has been made quick and fresh each time.
The restroom was clean, which is always a big plus.
Wendy's in general seems to be keeping up with the times, having better menu choices both health wise and price wise.
I wouldn't drive out of my way to go here, but I have had no reason to seek a quick bite to eat elsewhere.

Worst Wendy's I've been too.
Food always seems like it's been sitting awhile.
Bummer since it's location is near work.

I've never written a review on Yelp before so it really says something about how annoyed I am right now.
They missed something on my order and when I went back to the window, they saw me, turned away, and ignored me.
I'll never come back.
