First!
The Mesa Temple is a beautiful place.
It is a Holy place where families can be sealed together for eternity.
You can learn more about temples here: http://lds.org/church/temples?lang=eng.

Wonderful Christmas lights during the month December.
AMAZING Easter Pageant during the month of March.

A great place to walk around,  get information or watch videos on history of Mormon church.
Safe,  Beautiful and peaceful and for all faiths there is a visitors center and a large statute of Christ!

I absolutely love it here.
