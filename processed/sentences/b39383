I have seen these children really grow in their learning, their social abilities and adeptness, their verbal and physical skills, and their spiritual lives (yes, children have spiritual lives!
)  April and her staff are excellent and work hard to help every one of the children succeed and be ready for kindergarten.
This is a safe, loving, and Christian environment and a superb foundation to help our children have healthy, productive lives in body, mind and spirit.

St James Preschool is hands down one of the best preschools I have ever seen!
The staff is very energetic and enthusiastic and caring.
The children are loved and nurtured.
The children who attend St James Preschool are definitely well prepared for Kindergarten.
Ms April and Ms Bev are wonderful teachers.
The small class sizes allow for each child to grow and progress at their own speed.
Pastor Susan is so great with the children!
They look forward to going to Chapel.
I just can't say enough wonderful things about St James Preschool!

We started taking our son to St James Preschool this year and have been so happy with them.
The staff is one of a kind!
They are very hands on with the children and go out of their way to ensure their needs are being taking care of.
They have a wonderful learning environment and our son has learned so much in just a little time.
I will be putting our youngest child here once she is of age.
