I LOVE THIS PLACE.
It is the best dry cleaners I've ever had.
The owners name is Linda and she is wonderful!
I highly recommend Andy's Cleaners!

I also recommend Andy's!
The couple that runs this place are some of the nicest people I have met, especially in Las Vegas!
I have only ever really dropped off one item for myself because of a crazy day where my pencil skirt decided to rip all the way up the back.... yea that was fun!
However, the woman there fixed it for me and I have worn it once since then and it did not rip!
Most of the time they seem me come in with my boyfriends shirts, suits, and ties or picking them up, but they still know that I am there for him which makes me feel cool!
They are really awesome, inexpensive, and usually takes about 2 days for most items to be cleaned unless you drop it off on a Friday, then your probably looking at Monday since they are closed on Sundays!
Overall, highly recommended!

Great rates on all services.
As one who hats ironing, it's worth $1.50 per shirt for my work clothes to have them laundered and pressed here.
Friendly owners and always ready when they say they will be.
Only downside is sometimes due to the pressing machines, pleats and collars are pressed crooked or away from the fold, but when going fast and using machinery, that's bound to happen and I can live with it.
