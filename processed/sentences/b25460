Exellent choice of on tap beers.
Great food.
Always fresh and well prepared.
Staff has been there for a long time which always says alot about the restaurant and it's owner.
We  have been going there for 7+ years.
It's just a great place to watch a game and have a good meal.

This is a comfortable sports bar in north Mesa.
Located next door to divine wine.
A wall of televisions, good bar food, a really great beer selection including Stone IPA, SanTan Brewing Amber & Odell's 90 Schilling to name just a few.
The atmosphere is very clean and homey.
It's like being in your own living room.
The happy hour prices are reasonable, 10 chicken wings for 5.50 and a large veggie basket for the same price.
Great Deal!
Last night was an autograph session with the cactus league Chicago Cubs and the place was packed!
If your into baseball it's worth checking out Indigo's schedule to find these unique opportunities to see your favorite players right in your own neighborhood!
The place is pretty neat, worth checking out!

this was our second visit    the first review was posted to the wrong locale but never the the less  basically i am not a big sports bar fan but this place seams to keep the volume on all the tv's at a minimum the food is decent and the service,ambience is above average
