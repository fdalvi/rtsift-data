This new salon in EMR is wonderful.
It's clean, the chairs are comfortable, the staff is professional and extremely friendly, and the prices are in line with other salons in the valley!
I highly recommend this place, especially to the local residents who have been driving "down the hill" for this service.
I got the gel pedicure and am very happy with the color selection and the foot and calf massage.
Will definitely be a repat customer.

After receiving mixed reviews on Facebook, I decided to see for myself.
They did a great job.
It was clean and professional.
Prices are the same as "down the hill"...for acrylic gel.
I will return for sure.

Love this place!
I am a regular.
Staff is always friendly and professional!
And do a great job!
Why anyone wouldn't come here if they live in Estrella is a mystery to me.
Thanks Nathan for bringing this up the hill!
