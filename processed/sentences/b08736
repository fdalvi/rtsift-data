I have used AZ Taste for multiple events, sometimes last minute, and it's always the best.
Heck, they have gone half way across the state for me with little warning!
Their food is awesome and the service is impeccable.
These guys have it down to a science and their pricing is always better than any other catering company I have gotten bids from!
Cant wait for my next party...    PS SOUTHWESTERN MAC N' CHEESE!!!

Candace and team from Arizona Taste, YOU GUYS ROCK!
Food, service, professionalism, timing, attention to detail.
You guys did and had it all.
Catering service from Arizona Taste is highly recommended.
I used them for my wedding reception and will be a returning customer for future events.
Candace is truly a delight to work with.
She is on top of it from planning to execution.
With my venue being outdoors and no chef's kitchen, one of my biggest concerns is the common disappointment of cold wedding dinners.
This was NOT the case.
Everything was piping hot and delicious.
AZ Taste also kindly set up a hot tea station for my guests that was perfect to keep everyone warm.
AZ Taste did not miss a beat and should make it on every brides' short list.

I truly don't know how we would have pulled off our celebration without Arizona Taste.
To say that Mary and her team were wonderful would be an understatement.
Mary knew what we needed before we knew what we needed.
She took care of many behind-the-scenes details that we would have completely missed.
The food was exceptional and our guests enjoyed the menu immensely.
I highly recommend Arizona Taste and I will most definitely include them in my future celebrations.
