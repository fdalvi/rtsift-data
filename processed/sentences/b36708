Tried this place on a whim when we were in the area the other day.
The decor is very busy and almost reminded me of a cross between one of those children's party places and a bodega.
The gentleman who was behind the counter was very nice and took our order but didn't know how to work the register.
He said his wife would be back from running errands shortly and would ring us up.
The burgers were just OK.  A thicker version of a white castle burger without the white castle taste you crave, lol.
The price wasn't bad but, honestly, I would have rather spent a few bucks less and gone to a fast food joint.
The name also kind of had me assuming they served milkshakes, but I didn't see any on the menu.
There seems to be a ton of stuff on the menu (burgers, pizzas, a variety of fries, etc.
) but I think it might be a better place to bring kiddos, and I don't have any.

The decor will keep you awake that's for sure, but I went and have returned a couple times already for the food.
The philly cheesesteak is east coast perfection.
The meatball parm is also awesome.
The owners are easy coast through and through, so with all due respect, burgers aren't very close to the top of the VERY large menu.

This is a new place only open for a few months the food is incredible, word of mouth is their only advertisement and the place is packed  and the decorations is eyeopening , they have pick a prize  like woolworths used to do .They also have the biggest variey of food .Philly off the hook ,pizza is real new York everything made on the spot unlike the other places and their wings are to die for .
Our kids had the sliders 100% angus way better and thicker than white castles .the kicker was the Thrifty Ice Cream  and I don't have to say much its always been the best!!

Wonderful customer service and generous servings!
