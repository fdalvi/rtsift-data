We've been going to this place for a couple years now.
In that time they have never tried to upsell us on unnecessary services.
Prices are always transparent and reasonable.
The place is clean and the employees are friendly and helpful.
Look for coupons and deals; we just changed the oil in both cars for 14.99 each.
Helpful hint: make sure to schedule in advance.
They take walk ins, but it might be a lot longer than if you have an appointment.
It's a busy place on some days.

Even with an appointment a 4 hour job, by the book.
Took over 12.
Response from the general manager was, didn't know you needed your car back.
Yes the job got done, Yes the price was reasonable.
But when I make an appointment and then I am told it will be done by a certain time.
I expect it done, or some form of communication.
I should not have call in several times to check on the status of my car.
I will never go back.
My Car sat in the first bay from 1:30 till 2:30 the next day.
My business stays with Rand down at Midas.
While he may not be open on weekends, he at least communicates ahead of time if he can not make the time stated.
He is priced fair and does good work.

Although I didn't have the complete service done, I found the staff to be knowledgeable and friendly.
They were straight w me and made the right recommendations based on my vehicle and the work required.
I will be back if needed.
