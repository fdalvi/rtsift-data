Always have had good food here!
They never seem to be busy.
However going through the drive through will take about 10 minutes because they freshly fry your order.

Stopped here to get dinner for the family cuz Long John Silvers has always been a favorite of mine.
I was suprised to find it wasn't busy.
The store was clean, the staff was friendly & helpful, and the food was prepared quickly.
When the guy brought me my food he asked if I wanted sauce and I said yes some of everything.
When I got home and looked in the bags I was disappointed to find no Tartar sauce, no malt vinegar,  and a whole bunch of ketchup.
:(  Then I discovered  the next disappointment when I started eating the food.
I sure do remember the fish pieces being alot bigger.
The onion rings were not very good, the hush puppies weren't cooked all the way,  and the fries were soggy!
Not that it mattered really cuz I wont eat any of it without malt vinegar!
Ugh!
What a waste of $45.

I was pretty surprised eating here; the food is actually pretty good and freshly fried.
After eating about 1000 freshly fried carbs however your bodies metabolism slows to one akin to Jabbity Hut's.
The food here is like Chris Tucker's line from Rush Hour -  "Damn, Chin, this is some greasy sh**.
"   Indeed a $4 pile of greasy goodness

I was outraged when I stopped here , the cashier took 10 minutes to figure out the previous order and when she was asked to ring an item up she said "really".
I lost patience and left this establishment  .
