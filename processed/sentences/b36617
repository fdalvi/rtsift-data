its the court house  who wants to be on jury duty?
but it does have A/c

First time here this week.
There was a little confusion on my part regarding parking and they refused to validate the parking ticket so I ended up having to pay $12 for it, which is hard for me given my current financial situation.
I was also rather eager to be selected for a jury as I have never been on a jury before even after having been registered to vote since I was 18 and having a valid drivers license before.
This is the 6th time I have been summoned by an Arizona court.
3 of them got dismissed before I had to go in, twice (including this time) I pretty much just sat in the waiting room until they dismissed us, and only once I made it to jury selection but I was one of those dismissed.
I found that a bit disappointing though I realize it's really not anyone's fault.
It'd be nice if they had something entertaining on TV and sound like they do in the Pima County Court system...Last time I was called in I got to watch 50 First Dates which was amusing and helped make the time fly by a bit faster and lessened the blow of having to sit around all day.

I was there last week for jury duty.
Regardless of how happy the people on the videos look, it still sucks.
The waiting area is extremely large with comfortable seating and tv monitors everywhere.
Bring a book, music, snacks and settle in for what could be a long day.
