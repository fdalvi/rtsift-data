We love this place.
My two children started summer camp here.
The teachers are fantastic, the programs and facility are top notch.
I am looking forward to signing up for classes in the fall.

WPA is awesome..we went to open gyms and Uldi and his wife were working with the kids, spotting and helping them.
I am trying to work a summer camp or classes into our schedules.

Great place!
New and the staff is knowledgeable and friendly!
So happy I found somewhere like this to take my children!!
