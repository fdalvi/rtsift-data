I agree completely with the last review.
RUDE and extremely unprofessional!!!!
I also ordered for an occasion and they assured me over the phone and by email my product would be ontime for my event, and of course it wasn't.
I will never buy from them again.
To bad this site makes you give a star because they do not deserve even one.

I've always had the best experience ordering from this site.
It's shipped within an hour of ordering and arrives within 2 days.
Refunds were given just 2 days after I sent it back (sent back because one size too small).
I've ordered from here many times and will continue to do so.

My package was on time.
The costume that I have ordered was cheap n of course in clearance so no return.
not happy about them selling such a cheap outfit for $96.

I purchased by mistake 3 different orders all the same items due to Internet problems, never received packages.
When I called Yandy they said just return 2 aNd keep the 1 and we will give you full refund for the other 2.
One month later never received the 3 packages.
They said the address was wrong, but how if I ordered before from them.
They gave me a refund for all three but kept the shipping fee on all 3.
I called and spoke to a supervisor she said its was not their fault so they kept the shipping.
Will never order from them again...never.
Not professional at all.

This company is a complete scam!
Do not order from them!
Their product quality is poor and they will not refund your shipping cost to return the item to them.
A manager there by the name of Shannon claimed she would refund the shipping cost.
After I paid to return it, she went back on her promise and I had to pay for shipping a product that was terrible to begin with.
Please, please, please stick with reputable companies like Amazon or Zappos.
