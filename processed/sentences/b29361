I have been a member of the VMLSC for the last 8 years.
The rates are good, the facilities are generally well maintained, and the amount of equipment is adequate for the number of members.
This is not a gym for everyone.
The hours are not convenient for a 24 hour town.
Their hours are:   Monday to Thursday, 8 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Friday, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.; and Saturday 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
They are closed on Sunday.
They used to open at 6 AM and they were open on Sundays, but budget cuts and staff reductions have forced shorter hours.
If your schedule fits these times, it's a great place to go.
The people who go there vary in age - well maybe there are a few more retired people than the 30s range, but it a nice group.
There are tow main rooms for most people - the fitness room and the weight room.
The fitness room has 8 treadmills, 2 stair steppers, 4 ellipticals, and 4 stationary bikes.
The weight room has a nice variety of weight training equipment and there is a good collection of free weights.
In addition to these two areas, the facility has larger rooms where yoga classes and dance classes are held.
There is a standard gymnasium where we play paddle tennis several days a week.
While this place may not be for all, it's a great little gym to join and enjoy.
The photos I've included do not show the fitness nor weight rooms.
Older people with larger girth tend to get a tad cranky when you take their photos with sweat and all from exercising.

This facility has everything, a pool, workout room, basketball courts, and so on.
Inexpensive and except for the hours, it looks like a great place to workout, play sports!

Attended a little graduation ceremony at this facility and was impressed that they have such a nice place like this in town.
Ver clean, spacious and a lot to do (from what I could see).
The gym looked a bit small (compared to the big name gyms in town) but overall, I think if you have kids that need somewhere to go for activities, this would be it.

Soooooo I have had a hard time thinking about what I would write about this place.
I love the fact that the cost won't break your bank but my experience hasn't been that great.
We had signed up for mommy and me ballet and I've given it a good two months of trying it out.
The first class was pretty great and then on our way to class (takes us 15-20 min to get there) about 5 minutes before class started they called me and canceled.
Well thanks for the heads up 5 minutes before class was supposed to start....then the next couple of weeks it was just instructors being 15-20 minutes late and then the class was just horrible which we never got the time back that they had missed.
The class ranges from 18 months-3 or 4 years?
and it was just disappointing the next few weeks of class.
The other moms in the class weren't very friendly unless you were apart of their group but I met another "outsider" who had a toddler the same age as mine.
Overall, the experience was not great but I would definitely try a different class or wait till they got a better instructor.
