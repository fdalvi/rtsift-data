Awesome selection of beers and wines which you don't see anywhere else.
This is an old school liquor store, but with class....you really don't see too many of these around anymore.

Small little store, but I didn't see anything that we weren't looking for.
Prices & selections rival that of the few other liquor stores around town.
Helpful, friendly service helped us out, although this store was pretty easy to negotiate.

Some of the best selection, service, and prices around.
They have some of the best craft beers and wines available in the state.
The growler station is awesome, too.
They constantly share on their facebook page the new selection and tasting they are having.
Top notch!

These guys are awesome!
I'm brand new to the alcohol scene and they took the time to show me the ropes and pick out a few beers and liquors.
They're ridiculously knowledgeable and nice, even gave me a taste test  and let me try out seven various types of beer.
I love that you can pick six different beers for $9, and they have tons of local beers too.

This place is awesome!
The employee working there last night (didn't get their names) were super sweet!
I'm incredibly indecisive and the guy behind the liquor helped me decide.... And it wasn't a bad choice....
It was actually pretty good.
Will be going back!
Plus, you can't beat the prices!
