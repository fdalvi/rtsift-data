My first tattoo was done by John.
He was really cool and kept me occupied with conversations that made me and my best friend hysterical with laughter.
For my first tattoo I had a simple clover on my foot, and it didn't hurt like many said it would, plus he was so fast that I was in and out pretty quick.
He talked me out of swirls, which after seeing what they would have looked like, I am glad of now.
I am satisfied with it overall, and the price which was about 80$ with tip.

The artists at Battle Born are awesome.
My husband had his first tattoo done (at 35) by Jon in June and has almost completed a full sleeve now.
I've had two tattoos done and couldn't be happier.
I give him an idea and let him run with it...
He's an amazing artist.
The rest of the gang in the shop are great and it's always a good time.

I was visiting from out of town and popped into Battle Born Tattoo on a random Sunday after being referred by a friend.
I didn't have an appointment but from the second I walked in Britney was super welcoming and accommodating.
I wanted a small, one word tattoo and she drew it up for me on the spot and it was exactly what I had pictured in my head.
She was very thorough in cleaning everything and setting the exact placement of the tattoo.
She made sure I was comfortable while she was working on me and she just has a chill, laid back vibe that made the whole experience very relaxing.
The tattoo looked (and still looks) fabulous and healed perfectly.
I live in LA but will be making the drive to Vegas for my next tattoo - Britney is that good and I won't go to anyone else!
