This is a great place to get one's car worked on and detailed.
I love the fact that these guys really settle for complete customer satisfaction and that they guarantee their work.
I'll always send people here!

These guys do awesome work, and most importantly have awesome customer service.
They tell you what you need, and won't sell you extra stuff that you don't need for your system.
I have NEVER had any problems with my system and it sounds amazing.
They also do great car detail and window tinting.
If you want stuff done right, you won't be disappointed by dropping by Soundz N Performance.
