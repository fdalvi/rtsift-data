I started going to Dunn's Import in 1981 when I owned my first car, a Datsun 210.
Almost 30 years later, Jeff Dunn is still taking care of my car, along with my 3 children's cars too!
Every experience is a great one at Dunn's.
The staff are friendly and professional, and know their stuff!!
I would recommend Dunn's Import to anyone who has a foreign car.
I trust him to service my own children's cars.I think that says it all!

I started bringing my Audi here about 3 years ago.
The staff is friendly and forthcoming.
Generally speaking, car repairs suck but the mechanics here make the process here easier.
Most importantly, I feel like I can trust them.
I never feel pressured to get more work done than I can afford and they take the time to explain the repairs to me and answer my questions clearly and respectably.
They are just stand up guys.

This is where I take my 5-series BMW for service and I have been very pleased.
Friendly, honest, and they take pride in their work.
I have recommended them to friends and business associates that have foreign luxury autos as that is their specialty.
I also bought a set of Nokian All-Season hybrid (winter/summer combination) tires from them two or three years ago on their recommendation and they are the best tires I've ever owned.
Highly recommend Dunn's.
