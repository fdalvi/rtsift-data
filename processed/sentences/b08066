Daisy and Debbie have been cutting my children's hair for the past two years.
The service has always been excellent and the staff very friendly.

Great price, great service.
Not a high end salon by any means- but if you need a trim, cut,color on a budget OR need an eye brow wax, it's a great place.
$11.95 for kids, $13.95 for adults, and they ALWAYS give good coupons with each service.

Can't beat a coupon for 9.95 for a haircut.
I usually have Chelsea or Debbie cut my hair and they always do an excellent job.

Great for kids haircuts.
Terrible for adults.
Never going again

My son I walked in Danielle gave him a great haircut

I come here religiously for deep conditioning treatments.
I get them done anywhere from weekly to monthly and it's really cheap.
I've been to high end salons before for the same treatments and have spent $40-$100 for treatments these guys can do or $15 and less.
People constantly compliment me on my hair about how gorgeous it is, healthy, long, etc.
And I let them all know that they don't need to break the bank to look chic either.
Just find a stylist you trust and get deep conditioning treatments like crazy, and your hair will be just as healthy too.
And don't think for a moment I can't afford a high end salon.
Oh, I've dropped thousands at high end places and just ended up with giant bills, unhappiness, an headaches from the butcher job some of those high end places.
It's like the more money you drop, the more they feel they are an artist and their opinion on your hair matters more.
I like these little family places, their low prices, and very humble stylist.

Walked right in and got rescued from an over-grown out of date hair style transformed into a contemporary easy to manage hair style from Danni.
