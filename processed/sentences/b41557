AWESOME!
Top 3 favorite vape spots after my first visit!
This shop has everything you're looking for in a high-quality vape shop, whether you're brand new to vaping or have been in the game for years.
Kevin is warm, friendly, and extremely knowledgeable -  about products, the industry, and trends alike - and his selection of everything from starter kits to high-end mods is huge!
The selection of juices is vast, not to mention some of the best I've tried.
If you haven't stopped in here yet (even if you don't live nearby), you must asap!
Definitely worth the drive.
Since I feel like part of the family and can't get enough of the juices I picked up, I will most definitely be back.
Check this place out!

The owner is awesome,  kind,  and knowledgeable.
When i first starting vape shoppig here he filled me in on the latest products.
He is the Real Deal.
With great prices.
I have told and recommended to my friends.

This shop is great.
The people are very friendly and willing to help you out and explain any questions.
I will absolutely go back to try their juice!

Owner is very knowledgeable and honest!
I have been there twice and have left happy both times and will be back!
Def recommend this as your new vape shop!

I really only have one gripe about this shop.
The juices on the sample bar all contain various nicotine levels.
Some seem to be very low and have just a barely there throat hit, and some seem to be extremely high, to the point of not even being able to actually taste the juice you're sampling.

Love East Valley Vapors, they moved me up in the big boy stages of vaping.
Kevin is very helpful in the education of not having to spend a fortune and to sustain a reasonable cost of living outside of smoking.
Thanks Kevin for all of your help!!
