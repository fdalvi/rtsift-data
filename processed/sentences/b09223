This is one of the very few food places near where we live.
While it's not a particularly great pizza place, it's not bad either.
There are tables inside and the staff is generally friendly.
They have a nice-sized LCD on one wall where patrons can watch whatever game is on.
The pizza is serviceable, though not remarkable.
They serve lunch and have quite a few specials.
We probably get pizza from here once or twice a month.

We had dined in here years ago and were not thrilled about it, but this place is super close to our house so the wife and I decided to give it a second shot- Better!
We got some wings, a turkey sandwich, a gyro and a salad and they were all surprisingly good.
Prices are in line with what you would expect and they only have a $1.95 delivery charge which is cool.
My wife placed the order and said that the person on the phone was one of the nicest people that have taken a delivery order in general in a long time... so they get points for making the wife happy :)  Definitely a good option for those "no way we're cooking" nights.

As stated in another post, I believe this has closed, and been replaced by Rivers American Grill, which i gave 4 star for good bar food.
Apparently they have pizza as well (guess they left the oven behind?
