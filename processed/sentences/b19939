Geile Bar mit authentischer Atmosph√§re, weil da eher keine Touristen hingehen.
Man trifft da alles und jeden, vom Berufsalkoholiker bis zum Gelegenheitspenner.
Und der Wirt ist auch sehr nett.

This is really what you would call an old mans pub (though to me old counts as over 30, so don't be offended by this statement), but it's friendly enough and doesn't make you feel out of place.
On Friday and Saturday nights you get karaoke here and that's been the reason for my visits, because you get a decent amount of numbers in without the same amount of wait time you get elsewhere.
All round it's a decent enough pub, but I still feel a bit too young to truly feel at home here - maybe when I'm older though.

Seemed a withering pub for diehard locals.
