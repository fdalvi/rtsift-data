If you need a good dentist, he is very good.
He really cares about his patients and won't sugar coat a problem if he sees it.
He does except several different types of insurances.
But it's best to check before you have any work done.

I highly recommend Dr. Hilton.
I have had some nightmare experiences with Dentists but at Dr. Hilton's it has been great!!!
It was nice to know that I was a priority and well taken care of.

After having horrible experiences with dentists since living in Las Vegas (I attended an office where I saw four different dentists come and go within a two-year period, one of which royally messed up my mouth for more revenue), I finally found Dr. Paul Hilton on 1800Dentist.com.
The site recommended Dr. Hilton and listed his national certifications and other reviews that no other dentist in town had.
I have been going to Dr. Hilton's office for a couple of years now.
He has a contracted part-time hygienist (formerly Debbie, who has since retired) named Ashley who is a fresh, young professional and very good.
She is amazingly thorough, super personable, will chat with you about new innovations in dentistry, and give you the best advice on keeping your teeth squeaky clean.
A real perfectionist, she really loves her job, patients, and working for Dr. Hilton like no other hygienist I have come across.
Dr. Hilton himself is extremely ethical, pain-free, and personable.
He is quick and thorough, will not talk down to you, and stands behind his work from many years of experience.
His staff will tell you that thy love working for him as well and that he is extremely passionate about his work and practice.
Though it may be out your way if you live across town from the office, to me it is worth the drive for a good, moral professional like Dr. Hilton.
