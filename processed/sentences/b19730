Another one of the stores in this center that opened this last weekend.
Walk in there are several employees gathered at the front counter have a good old chat.
No other in the place but we the wandering shoppers.
It seems much like Razmataz, has a bunch of stuff but the one thing we wanted.
But hey they can't have everything, right.
It seems to me a decent enough store and were greeted on our way out ;-{)   I do hate the lighting in these stores.
So dull and it just saps the energy out of me.

Customer service is not their highlight.
The copy center is improving but stay away from purchasing business cards.
Regardless it is still my main point of copy services.
It has potential!

The worse customers service ever.
1:30 pm.
8 people in line waiting and they don't want to open another register.
The lady in front of my stated "where our easy button?
"  No reply from any 1!!!

Kind of messy unorganized there are people working here but not really working.
I walked around the store a couple of times before I found what I was looking for.
The best part was checking out.
The cashier was nice.

Helpful staff.
I always find what I need ... and want.

Play ALWAYS sucks on printing things!!
Second time coming here and the orders are NEVER ready.
They always have someone working behind the counter who doesnt look like they know what they are doing.
And look at you with blank face about the order.
Another customers order was not ready either.
And was annoyed.
I had even received the email as I was standing there saying my order was ready.
Who is sending me confirmations when its not ready???
So now waiting to get it printed where a manager has to show her how to do it.
Never coming to this staples!!
I will never come here again!!
Only reason I gave them two stars is because they gave me my business cards for free.
Thank you!
