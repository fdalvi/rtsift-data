My friends often find themselves with mouths agape when they learn about how many different supplements I take each day.
It's not a lot, really, but i suppose my inventory of training-related consumables can make the average joe gasp.
At any rate, I purchase most of my supplements online... because:  1) Some of them are too hard to find at brick and mortar stores 2) Some of them are customized specifically for me 3) They're just cheaper online  But when I do need to pick up something up from an actual store, I often go to this GNC at the Fashion Show Mall because it's literally down the street from where I work.
From a price standpoint, there are better places to go, I'm sure.
And when it comes to selection, there are definitely better places to go.
But you can't beat the personalized service at this place.
And it's not just because I shop here regularly.
I've noticed that average customers, most of whom are tourists, receive great service as well.
My five-star rating is driven by the service alone.
Other GNCs in the Las Vegas area that deliver on service:  West Flamingo in the Smith's shopping center (near Fort Apache) Ann Rd and Farm

Love this GNC!!
If you come here, the old guy (didnt get his name) knows his stuff.
Go to him.
He is so nice and knowledgable.

They had what I needed and the employees were fairly helpful.
