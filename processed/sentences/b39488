Dr. Gina was compassionate and professional in caring for our dog.
Having our dog cared for at the comfort of our own home made for a more pleasant experience than having to take our dog into an office environment.
We appreciated her expertise and care provided to our pet.
We would highly recommend Dr. Gina's veterinary services as we will be using her for any future veterinary needs.

Excellent service, extremely caring!
I have seven cats and they all love her!
Dr Gina came the same day, on two different calls.
I highly recommend her!

I am so impressed with this whole business.
We needed a local vet for our 3 dogs and I happened on the Valet Vet.
Not wanting to wrestle mine into a scorching hit car to travel to a clinic, this house call vet caught my eye.
Dr Gina and her assistant came in and sat right down on the floor in my living room, making themselves very accessible and non threatening to the dogs, on their own turf.
After a few minutes of gentle pets, I don't think the dogs even realized they were being examined as they were just soaking up the attention.
One of my dogs had a pretty big issue that was going to require some dental surgery.
This was expected on our part so no surprise.
We had an appointment very soon after diagnosis.
Today was surgery day and, I have to say, that van is state of the art.
My dog is recovering nicely and all went well.
Dr Gina was mindful of the expense and offered a few payment options if needed.
Overall I believe Valet Vet is reasonably priced for the level of care shown to my dogs.
This business exceeded my expectations.
Yes, there is a house call fee.
For the convenience of me not having to pack them up and go, for the lower stress on my dogs who just had a "visit" at home rather then a sterile office to smell all the strange smells and get worked up...the house call fee is MORE then worth it.
VERY impressed.
I'm proud to have you as our family vet.
