I needed a dozen roses and I didn't have a lot of time.
The roses were awesome and the service was great.
Will be back.

This place is my go to for flowers for any occasion.
The owners are really nice too and take the time to talk to you on a personable level.
I have frequented this location often and they do a great job on short notice and provide great service, fast delivery, and beautiful arrangements.
Best part of it all....my gf likes them too (maybe because shes the one getting the flowers)

I picked Garden of Eden for my wedding flowers for two reasons, they are the florist for my church and Kathy and Sharon are sooooooo nice!!!!
Kathy did my consultation.
She was so helpful, being a not do it yourself bride at all i needed all the help i could get!!!
I didn't see my flowers til the day of my wedding and i was head over heals in love with them, it was like Kathy was in my brain seeing what i wanted to do with the pink and white lilies, hydrangeas, peach and antique colored roses, and alistromeria.

I was skeptical in choosing which local florist to go to.
Boy I am glad that I have found garden of eden!
The product that you deliver is high quality.
I have used 1800 flowers for over ten years and I have to admit, their roses does not compare to yours.
Thank you again for making my wife happy on our anniversary.
I will be looking forward to dealing with you for future occasions
