I recently had a leaking tire on a Saturday evening on the other side of the city, my TPMS warned me, so I aired up and I ended up at the location on Luke AFB that uses this address in their invoices.
I thought it would be a simple fix.
Unfortunately they did not treat me very well (my opinion).
I think (cannot prove) that they "added" a shiny, not a scratch on it after 30 miles, screw towards the rim of the tire to make me have to purchase a tire; instead of just fixing the nail that was in the center of the tread for $20.
Interesting how both were in the tire along the same location, not much imagination, I guess.
They conveniently had only one left of "their" brand of tire I would require, and it was quite expensive; much more than a quick search on my phone for a matching replacement showed.
Then they wanted me to leave the tire with them until Monday while searching for a replacement.
Not feeling very comfortable with the situation, I had them put the spare on and the "bad" tire in the back, at least they didn't charge me the $20, but nobody could look me in the eye afterwards.
I limped home on the donut spare at 50 mph, pissed off, you know how it goes.
I have no proof, just a feeling, and that feeling will keep me from doing any business with this company ever again.
I ended up searching for another place and was specifically looking for a place that was open on Sunday.
Got a great deal at a Big O Tires that is local and had a few good reviews.
Now the the Big O Tire place has one more, they got my business, and I'll stop by there when it's time to replace tires when they are worn, NOT at a Firestone place.
Don't people realize if you jip someone, you're more likely to tell 10 people not to use their services?

Located at the Luke AFB Gas Station and Class VI store, this Firestone is very convenient when you need an oil change or tire repairs.
Great place to get your car serviced and the guys who run the desk are super!
Appointments are generally available and I have had not complaints about the work done on my car.

As long as I live in the Phoenix area I will take my Jeep here.
The guys that work here are knowledgeable, fair, honest with great integrity.
I have taken my jeep here many times and have always felt they were extremely helpful and professional.
