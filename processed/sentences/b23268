I came to this location while waiting for some car repairs.
Ordered a side of hash browns and got some work done on the computer.
Customer service from the counter was superb, and the place was spotless.
Very impressed.

I only ordered two sandwiches to go and it took forever to come out .
then they walked around with it on a tray calling out a number for an order I never received because they didn't give me a receipt.
They finally bagged it up and sent us on our way with a 'sorry bout that'.Our sandwiches werent hot but they were,luckily, delicious.
