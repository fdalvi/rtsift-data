Their freighting is horrible.
DO NOT rely on the date they give you.
I am still waiting for my product, so I can not comment on their product yet.
They have setback my vacation because I used the dates they gave for delivery.
Do not rely on their dates and maybe you will have a better experience.

Great service!

I am a contractor and I deal with alot of companies selling contractors products and these guys are definitly one of the best ive ever worked with.
I was surprised to see so many women working here, but they really knew there stuff about turf and even taugnt me a new trick.
They have a great selection at the best prices in the valley.
I had a big job and I needed the turf immediatly and they had it in stock!
I couldn't believe how much grass they had in stock.
Will defintily be back!
