This used to be a jazz station (smooth jazz- that I liked, BTW) so when I heard this station while in my husband's uncle's car a few weeks back, I really liked the format.
It's Old School R & B- a mix of music from the 50's, 60's, 70's (second favorite), & 80's (my favorite out of the eras mentioned).
I used to like 93.1 FM's play list (which included the long forgotten freestyle music I grew up with) but it always seem to change, doesn't it?
Anyway, this morning, I heard "It Takes Two", "I Feel For You" and "In My House.
" This are songs that aren't played on the radio anymore.
I miss this music.
Well, now I have a choice, and I can flip to this one, if another preset is playing commercials (boring).

Bring back the smooth jazz that we followed  for years, this new format is boring and a sad excuse for music selections.
Took it off of my presets on everything., Oasis 105.7 is gone I guess...too bad  .Could not give it less than one star or I would have.............

Just moved to Vegas and this station is my new guilty pleasure!
I love it!
Love it!
Love it!
Reminds me of KTWV in Los Angeles.
I wish that they would throw in more jazz like the Wave does, but I love the old school mix!
I get hear Parliament/Funkadelic, Zapp & Roger, nobody is playing them like these folks are!
If you come to Vegas, turn to this station...oh, and Art LeBoe is on...whoo hoo!!!
Love IT!!

I have been in the LV  since December 2013, and I still love this station!
My wish is that really dig into the crates and play some stuff that hasn't been heard in a long while!
Examples: slave, New birth, I heard a kc and the sunshine band song that noone played in ages and I heard it on 88.1.
Yes, I have discovered the other station!
I still love this station but Tuesday and Thursday is 88.1.
I know you guys can step it up.
