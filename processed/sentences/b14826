This location I have been going to since they opened their doors.
But today I was a little disappointed in the customer service manager.
Ashley was in a line with a light on and helping a customer with a problem.
She allowed me to stand there for a few minutes.
Then she placed a closed line sign and flipped off the light, she continued to help the customer but never stated, " Sir, I am closed the next line will be able to help you.
" NOthing let me stand there until I realized that she was not going to help me.
Buddy is the manager there and I hope he realizes this is the type of manager running the front when he is not arround.
I will make sure I speak to him next time I am in.

Remodel is coming together.
The new pharmacy managers are very helpful and knowledgeable.
This location has a full service chase bank branch also.
Not to bad for a smaller version of the Fry's store.
There is a fuel points redeemable gas station out front which is very helpful.
Can't wait to see the final remodel.
