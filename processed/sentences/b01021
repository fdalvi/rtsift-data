I have seen Dr. Bob and his sister as well.
They are very soft-spoken, gentle and knowledgable.
My neurologist recommended me to them.
Note: they are opthalmologists not optometrists.

When I unexpectedly began feeling pain in my right eye a friend recommended that I go see Dr. Bob Bollington.
Dr. Bollington is an amazing ophthalmologist.
He is knowledgeable, conversant and thorough.
Before the appointment was over he ensured that I had all of my questions answered.
Everyone who works in his office is very friendly, efficient and helpful.
I highly recommend Dr. Bob Bollington if you are looking for an outstanding ophthalmologist.

Excellent!
I had a chronic weepy right eye after chemotherapy.
I thought it was infected but found out that it was just blocked tear ducts that could be "treated" with hot compresses or hot water from the shower.
Oh, they did have a machine for that but recommended that I try the inexpensive way first.
Works like a charm!
So polite, and caring.
The staff is a little cooler than the doctors but I went to see the doctor, not the staff.
These are eye doctors, not people fitting you with glasses, although they do write prescriptions for glasses.
I found them by asking other physicians where they went for their eye exams.
These guys are as good as I have found in Phoenix in the last 25 years.
I saw Doctor Villareal.
She was as kind and efficient as any doctor I have met.
Dr's Bullington are supposedly better.
That would be a real challenge.
So you can't go wrong here.
Yes, I am going back to them from now on.
Please don't tell too many people.
I have looked very long and hard for a trustworthy and accomplished eye doctor.
Go see for yourself, then only tell your closest friends.
The last thing we need is a crowd in the office and long waiting times.
