My friends and I shopped here for some alcohol to take back to our hotel room.
I was in the middle of shopping, and I had to take a shit.
You see, I'm not shit shy.
I'll take one anywhere.
Anyway, I had to go so I gave my friends money for my portion of the liquor and headed for the restrooms.
I have to say, the restrooms were actually very clean for a grocery store.
I did my do, or doo doo (shall I say) and left.
I was pleasantly surprised by my bathroom experience there.
Great place to shop and shit.

3.5  A designated gambling area in a legit super market?
I've seen it all.
Aside from the time share we stayed in, I have to say Food-4-less really saved us dough when staying in Vegas.
In town for a bachelor & bachelorette get-a-way and conveniently located just a few blocks from the resort were they able to support our alcoholic addiction for a lot less.
Some wanted beer, some wine and other's just liquor.
Thanks F4L you helped whet each one of our whistle's.

There is not, nor has there ever been a Food For Less at this address or map location.
I'm not sure how to let Yelp know this, just posting it here instead.
