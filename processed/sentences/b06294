This is a great walgreens for pharmacy.
Before I was going to the one down lake mead by rampart.
There I would frequently have to wait in line to pick up things for a long time, they wouldn't be able to refill same day etc.
I think that location is open 24hours but who goes to the pharmacy at 3AM other than drug addicts?
Answer- no one.
So I am more than willing to trade convenience for shorter hours.
