It was a crazy hot Sunday afternoon and I realized I needed some party supplies for Monday... specifically, I was on the hunt for some kind of confetti gun, wand, or popper.
I searched this website called Yelp and came across a listing for Party City in Mesa.
While Mesa sounds far, far away, I learned that it's only about a fifteen minute drive from Old Town, and Party City is open until 6pm on Sundays... perfect!
The parking lot was empty when I arrived but there were a handful of employees working when I walked in the door.
And surprisingly, there were extremely helpful.
They pointed me in the right direction for the confetti and helped me find a few additional party supplies too.
Everything was moderately priced and they had a great selection.
I was pleasantly surprised by my Party City shopping experience and I will definitely return next time I need any kind of party supplies.
Thanks party City!

Party City saves the day!
Here I am, heading to an event and in need of some last minute supplies...specifically some stencils and sadly the places I'd visited before were not quite cutting it.
I walked in and grabbed the last minute supplies that I knew only Party City would have, but then I found what I only hoped they would have.
That's right my friends, they had a stencil kit with all the letters and different shapes and for a very reasonable price...under $5!
The staff here is very friendly and the store is always clean and stocked full.
It is definitely one of my favorite Party Cities and a little off the beaten path so I'm able to find what I need and get in and out quickly.

Looking for something to do on a rainy day?
Stop by your local Party City for hours of browsing through the aisles.
I like the Mesa location because it's huge.
If you need a costume or party accessory, you'll probably find it here.
I stopped by last week looking for ideas for my Santarchy costume.
Party City has many displayed on the wall- elves, reindeer, snowmen, Mr and Mrs. Claus costumes etc.

Did like standing in line to look at pictures on the wall to get a costume.

Very clean and organized.
Plenty of parking and the female employee that checked me out was both happy and helpful.

Party City is pretty good about having a bunch of useless stuff you really need for some unknown reason or event.
Just popped in for sum monster high birthday trinkets, pi√±ata, candy & party necessities and of course they had a wide arraignment.
I seam to come here every year to get my daughter whatever she's currently into & they always got the gear.

Over priced and no customer service.
