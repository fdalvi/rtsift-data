Very convenient located in the Target/Kohl's shopping center on Blue Diamond.

Very friendly staff, sometimes the wait at the drive through teller is longer than if you walk in.
They have a walk up ATM and a separate drive through ATM.
If you are a Wells Fargo Account holder you can use their free public notary service, just call ahead to make sure someone is there who is a notary.
This has saved me money on several occasions.
Not that this is a review of Wells Fargo the company, but I love their on-line bill pay!
Who needs stamps any more??!?
I think I still have Christmas stamps from like 2 years ago!
LOL

My husband & I had to stop in during his lunch break to deposit his check for our home's down payment.
We typically do not come to this branch as it's not close to our house, but like I said, it was urgent & close to his office.
We have NEVER had a problem with the gazillion other Wells Fargo locations we have been to (clients for over 10 years), but these people would NOT cash his check for us, even though the balance in his account covered his paycheck.
The manager was super rude about it too and unwilling to help even though NO OTHER Wells Fargo has given us a problem about cashing a company check.
Total waste.
