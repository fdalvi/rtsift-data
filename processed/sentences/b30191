Tammy is the best!
She is so good at what she does, she has so much experience!
My eyelashes turned out 10 times better than what I thought they would.
She is a perfectionist and puts so much time and effort into her clients.
I'm already addicted to my eyelash extensions!

Tammy rocks !
I have had my fair share of lash artists ...
Some slow , some don't listen and some don't really care .. None of which is the case w Tammy !!
I am a woman who likes her lashes stacked full with a glamorous look !
Tammy gave me exactly what I wanted !!!
Stacked .. Stacked .. Stacked !!
Not only is Tammy great w lashes she has developed her own line of products w her partner Nelly !
This girl is the business !!
