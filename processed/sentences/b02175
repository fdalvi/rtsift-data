GREAT tanning salon!
a little pricey but totally worth it.
The beds are super hot, and you are brown after like two sessions.
Amazing staff, and in a neat convenient area.

So I've been with carefree tan for about 2 years now and I love it!
I would seriously not go anywhere else!
Me and my boyfriend are there everyday!
The staff is very friendly and efficient.
Some people would say that it's a little pricey but I beg to differ me and my boyfrind have unlimited tanning with mistique included on a family plan which is definitly worth doing,if an option and it's great we love it!
The beds are awesome, very powerful and have built in fans.
The mistique is awesome!
I spray every time after I lay down and I get really dark!
even after the first time.
highly recommended!

From Downtown Chicago so used to great hair care...
But this place reminded me of home... Linda is phenomenal and after stepping a few feet from the door I got a compliment on my hair....
I highly recommend this to anybody who's looking for great and relaxing haircut..
