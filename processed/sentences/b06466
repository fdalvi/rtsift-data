good guy

John Rader was my CPA for the past five years.
I trusted him and referred him to many others.
I am very conservative with my taxes and they are not very complicated.
Within the last year I have been contacted by the IRS on two occasions for mistakes he made on my taxes from years back.
Now I'm paying penalties and have a huge tax bill to pay.
Additionally, I have asked him to resolve the mistakes (which he admitted to).
His resolutions have been declined by the IRS each time.
Just a warning, he may not have always been on his game, and you might want to have a professional review your taxes from previous years.
My apologies to anyone I referred to him.
