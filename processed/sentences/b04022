This gas station doesn't have the best prices but I like stopping here for coffee, energy drinks, lotto, etc...They don't have those window salesman that hassle you and the service is always good.

In terms of gas stations I like this one the best.
The service clerks are nice and helpful, the pumps are easy to use, and there is never a wait.
I didn't used to be picky about my gas until I had some costly fuel system repairs and several mechanics made the statement to only use Chevron gas when possible.
It's true that you'll spend a little more per gallon, but the quality of the fuel will help maintain your engine and cost you less in repairs in the long run.

I have just started using this gas station in the last few months.
It is right on the corner of Rural and Baseline , very convenient i must say.
The best part is they always have very good prices.
You have a full little convenient store inside.
Also, they have a car wash not the greatest....
But, it is good when you need the dust off.

I like this place, It is close to home.
Plus it is open whenever i need them.
But, sorry to say i do not know the hours.
Gas is a really good price here compared to a lot of other Chevron's near by.
They also have a full mini mart inside as well as a   car wash. Not the best but good when you are in a hurry.
Great location,right on the corner.
