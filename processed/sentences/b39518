I have fair skin so Ive never really done any type of tanning.
I got a Solar Glo airbrush tan for a Vegas trip and the color came out perfect!
I was getting compliments all weekend on my nice golden summer tan.
I will definately be back!

Solar Glo is amazing!
Angela took her time to pick out the perfect color for me and really paid attention to detail.
They use the best product on the market and I would recommend Solar Glo to anyone looking for the perfect airbrush tan

Angela is amazing!
Its the first spray tan that actually looks natually sun kissed as opposed to orange or splochy!
She knows her stuff!

Solar Glo is the best Spray Tan I've had hands down!
NOT blotchy, didn't fade in areas...just perfect!
The level of professionalism and kindness was amazing!
Thank you Angela!
Definitely coming in again soon!

I was so impressed with Angela at Solar Glo.
I have gone back twice!
My first spray tan with her was also my first spray tan experience.
My tan was even and lasted almost 10 days.
I was scared that I would have that orange tint and I didn't experience that at all.
Angela is so personable.
There are definitely people out there I would not feel comfortable standing naked in front of for 15 minutes but she was great!
I felt the prices were fair and their customer service was excellent.
Parking was easy.
It is a bit hidden but I after making a phone call I was given directions and found it easily.
