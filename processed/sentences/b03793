Good food, very good service.
Gives one the feel of the south without going overboard...
I tend to hang out in the bar area seating even when I go there to eat... decent menu, the calimari is good....

all i remember was ....food was sooooo goooood.
the blackened fish is the BOMB!!

This placed closed a while ago!
When they were open, they had great happy hour hurricanes and deep fried pickles!
Regular menu seemed overly pricey.
Oh well...gone now!
