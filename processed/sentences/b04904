Decent selection of flavors, polite & quick service.
Only thing is there are eight chairs.
Total.
Not the best thing when you have a family of five.

Can't go wrong with Ben and Jerry's.
I had "chocolate therapy" the other day and it's definitely my new favorite flavor.
Other flavors that are always good are peanut butter chocolate swirl, chocolate chip cookie dough and coffee coffee buzz buzz buzz

Based on the service the other day, this location is down to 2 stars from 5.
For whatever reason, ALL their chocolate ice creams were too soft to be served.
And since I came here specifically for the chocolate therapy, this was a huge disappointment.
I sadly ordered a regular sized  non-chocolate flavor and the woman working scooped it into a child sized cup.
While I think I still got the correct amount of ice cream for a regular, it was overflowing in the small kiddie cup making it a little difficult/messy to eat.
I think I'll just stick to buying my Ben and Jerry's pints from the grocery store.
