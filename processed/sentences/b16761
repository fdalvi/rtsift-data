I was in an accident, needed my car repair.
The guys at Spring Mt Auto Body was very nice and helpful.
They explained everything to me and even told me things  that I didn't need be charge for.
They did a   Great job fixing it.
It look like new and the paint job was incredible.
No one will ever tell I was in an accident.
Surprisingly my car look better now than before the accident.
Thank You so much to Spring Mt Auto Body, GREAT JOB!!!

i have been through 2 years of dealing with these people on repairing my vehicle.
I had to hire a consultant which told me they fraudulently did not repair the vehicle properly as on the estimate.
They were suppose to replace a part on it and in turn just fixed it and covered it up.
I am going to have to file with the state and go after their bond.
beware of this company.
you will regret it like i have.
now i have to get my vehicle completely repainted.
just to repair the damage they created.
