Tried Bar Tepo for the first time tonight, thought it was pretty decent.
I had heard from a friend that the Brown Sugar Hoisin Chicken Tacos were good so my wife and I tried them off of the tapas menu, they were very good.
My wife commented that she would order the tacos from the dinner menu where they are also available.
For dinner my wife had the Chicken Caesar Salad, the chicken was cooked very nicely with good seasoning, but the salad itself (at risk of sounding snobbish) was rather pedestrian.
I had the Prime Rib Sandwich which was a really a French Dip sandwich.
The sandwich was good but in my mind misrepresented on the menu.
My problem with this restaurant is that it is not sure what it wants to be.
The decorating is very high end, but the food we received does not reflect the atmosphere.
We will definitely be back and try the food again, hopefully I can raise my rating of this place.
I really want it to be good.

Decided to give this place another try.
My husband and I had dinner here after they first opened, we went again this week.
Both times the food was horrible.
The interior is clean, the staff friendly, the patio could definitely use some attention but you just cannot get past the food.
I also noticed that some of their wine was bad (the waitress went through several bottles before finding a good one) and they don't seem to be keeping all their wine/beer in stock as some of it was unavailable after ordering off the menu.
Overall, I give it a thumbs down based on the taste and quality of the food alone.

Wife and I have been here three times now(twice for brunch).
The food is very good and the decor is hip and stylish.
Each time we've been, it's been pretty empty.
It's too bad that locas owned places like this struggle and right outside the California Pizza Kitchen (yuck!
) has a line.
We like the lobster burger ($18 here $30+ in Vegas) , cheese puffs, green chile, great service,and bar drinks.
I hope it sticks around.

We accidently found Bar Tepo their second week open; we now been 8 times.
We recommend it to all our friends.
Five couples have gone there and thanked us for sending them.
All the appetizers are amazing- especially the ribeye stuffed poblano and the Mac and Cheese (Wow)!
We had Ramone as our waiter the first visit and have asked for him everytime since - he is excellent.
As far as the person who rated them with 1 star I'm sure they own a restaurant close by and don't want them to succeed.
I'm very familiar with this since I own a business listed on yelp and have had competitors that have proceeded with similar tactics.
Babbitt Motor Werks.
Great job guys, We love visiting your place!
