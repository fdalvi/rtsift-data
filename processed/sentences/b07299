I purchased a chaise lounge last week, and finally had it delivered the day before yesterday.
I worked with Ingrid, through their online chat.
She was very helpful!
I love my chaise, the delivery guys were nice too.
My only small complaint - which is the ONLY reason why I gave them 4 stars - is because I can't just purchase things from their website directly.
I enjoy the whole concept of clicking and receiving, so this is just a personal thing for me.

Carlos Castro is the man to work with , he is polite and goes the extra mile to help  you out ...... ask for Carlos HE ROCKS

Quite simply, the easiest shopping experience I've ever had outside of Amazon.com.
Ingrid replied to my phone call and 2 emails almost immediately and helped me find just the right vanity table for my wife's birthday.
Not only did she send me images of the products to choose from (the one we originally looked at online was out of stock) but she handled the transaction over the phone and I was able to pick it up the next day.
In and out in 10 minutes.
From now on Del Sol is my first stop for furniture buying.
Thanx Ingrid!

They don't pay their bills.
Did work for the company and it took over 90 days to get the money.
Wouldn't call back.
Kept saying "check in the mail" Well, never was in the mail.
