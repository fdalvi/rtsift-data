Friendly most helpful staff ever.
Free attentive water testing, appears to be family owned...
I dig em.
The final words:  Popcorn machine  Need I say more?

I strive to support locally owned businesses, and keep my money in AZ.
I moved to the Dale and needed a closer pool supply store.
Having lived in Phoenix, I know Checker Pools is the spot to go, but in Scottsdale I was unsure.
Using my Yelp app I found the highest rated pool supply store in the Dale, and it was Corson's.
I paid a visit to buy pool chemical and ask questions and the guys there were super knowledgeable and very very helpful.
I got what I needed and learned a great deal.
I can't imagine going to a chain, where a 15 year old kid is the senior employee- and doesn't know a pool skimmer from a rubber duckie.
Check out Corson's- they will get you squared away.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this locally family owned business!
If you are a smart pool owner you will without a doubt choose this place for all your pool needs from now on!
This place is amazing!
They have everything you need to care for your pool, not only do they have a great selection of products with amazing rates but the customer service is like none-other.
They go above and beyond to help you out and answer all your questions.
The location is a little difficult to find but its in your best interest to find this little gem!
This is a perfect example of why you should always support small business such as this awesome shop!!

The employees at Corson's (Scottsdale) are AWESOME!!!!
My pool was so green and within a couple days they advised me how to make it beautiful..
I have been using them for all my pool needs for many years and have always found them to be professional and knowledgeable.
Their is a BIG difference between the expertise of these people and their competition.
I strongly recommend any pool owner to use them for advice and the quality of product  they sell!
