Love this place.
Great owners.
Delicious take on southern food.
Being from the South I take my biscuits and gravy seriously and these guys do not disappoint.
Their chicken is the truth.

First thing you should know about Old Dixie's: It is a food truck and thus you should visit their website to find where they actually will be located when you have a hankering for delicious food.
Second thing you should know about Old Dixie's: Jen, one of the co-owners, is amazing and will happily chat with you about the source of every ingredient featured on their menu, the methodology behind the various dishes, and anything else you desire.
Third thing: The chicken, biscuit, and gravy sandwich is amazing.
Everything is locally sourced as much as possible and cooked very well--the fried chicken was moist yet crispy, the biscuit flaky, and the country gravy was phenomenal.
Can't wait to try the chorizo meatloaf and arugula sandwich next time!

5 stars as compared to other food trucks.
Best food truck breakfast (the only 'meal' I've had from them).
Biscuits and gravy, fried chicken biscuit with cheese, bacon and gravy (!!
) and the breakfast biscuit (egg, cheese and bacon) all were top-notch.
Fried chicken breast was moist and well cooked.

Generous sized piece of white meat chicken, southern fried (with zesty spices) laid on top of a oversized biscuit covered in white gravy.
Just like my grandma used to make.
So full of flavor, so filling.
I could only eat half before my belly expanded beyond the reach of my pants.
Best $8 I've spent all day!
I'm going to Facebook stalk them so I can partake in some more of their other southern goodness!

HOLY SHHHHHH......SMOKES Old Dixie, your one of my latest FAVORITE food truck to frequent.
I have even trekked out of my way after reading your post on Facebook of being set up at the Central Farmers Market one Saturday to satisfy a craving I had for your goodness.
I am hooked on their SUPER SIZED Biscuits.
This is no Jimmy Dean Microwave Mini Biscuit Sandwich this is REAL and BIG.
I am sure they could put just about anything on or between these and it would be FABULOUS!
As I daydream back to the first time I tried Old Dixie's it was a cool Autumn night in Downtown Phoenix, First Friday was in full effect and I had already planned to catch my dinner at one of the food trucks stationed at the Roosevelt Row Art Market .
I had tried each one there, some more than once....but this was new, uncharted territory for me and I was ready to experience it.
Reading the menu I didn't know what to expect  most if not all their sandwiches are $8.
Eight dollars for a biscuit sandwich I thought imagining some Pillsbury Grands Sized Biscuit or a KFC Biscuit.
But I thought what the heck, it is my goal to give every Truck a chance.
I ordered the Chicken, bacon cheddar and Gravy sandwich, and I was reassured by the young lady taking my order that I made a wise choice as that is one of their most popular.
As I took a spot near the Pick-Up window,  I glance over to see another persons order....HOLY SH*T....is that the Sandwich?!
It was HUUUGE.
Shortly there after my name was called and I picked up my own piece of history.
Little did I know then that I would be quite taken with Old Dixie's.
The biscuit , thick and the perfect balance between soft and sturdy enough to be a sandwich.
The chicken was a moist generous piece of crispy fried chicken breast.
This was then topped with a creamy authentic country gravy, thick smokey well cooked (not to much not too little) bacon and a slice of cheddar cheese.
LOVE....
I took on this sandwich with a Knife and Fork....and had to save half for later.
Since that day I have also tried their Carolina Pulled Pork Biscuit Sandwich.
A generous portion of  Pork  so smokey and tender  is topped with a mustard style bbq sauce and a red cabbage slaw.
Ohhh  Old Dixie's I will be back and I will bring all my friends to come enjoy your down home goodness!
