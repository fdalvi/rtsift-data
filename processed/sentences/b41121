Such great professionals!
Very efficient and caring!
I have had 2 laser removal sessions and there has been such a drastic change for the better!

This is my first experience with getting a tattoo removed and this was the first place I went.
Very friendly and professional staff.
I don't necessarily regret getting the tattoo I did, but I am very thankful that MD Laser is in the business that they are so that I have the option of getting ink removed.
I highly recommend MD Laser!

Recently had derma-planing done here.
Great service, nice people, and warm atmosphere.
Great prices also!

Competitive prices friendly staff, will use them again in the future.
