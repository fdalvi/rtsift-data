This CVS location is now open for business.
It's a newly constructed building, clean and bright.
There is plenty of parking, but given the intersection/SEC of 7th Street and Indian School Road, expect plenty of traffic when entering or exiting the parking lot.
It's just the nature of being in this busy area.

Don't you just love how convenient a convenient store can be?
Yeah me too!
Well I've walked in here after work for chapstick, gum, and emergency stockings before work one day.
But you know all these places are the same as far as what they carry and blah blah blah.
This is a new CVS and its clean, well lit, organized and everything is clearly marked.
The staff is friendly and quick to get you through the line.
That is all.

Great deals await.
Nice store and great staff.
Get your rewards card, coupons and start saving some bucks ; ) Very convenient to just pop into when going to work or heading home.
