Wonderful service - my fiance and I both had a full treatment and it was excellent.
Thanks Lmarie!

I had a gift certificate my husband bough for three body wraps.
She cancelled the first three appts because her father died.
Understandable.
A month later I called to find out if I could schedule the appts.
After many telephone tags I finally got a hold of her.
The website states her hours as T-Sa 9-6.
She told me the appts needed to be every other day so I tried to schedule M, W, F.  She indicated that she teaches a class on T, W, Thurs until 3 so the soonest she could do would be 4.
I told her the certificate and website said her hours were 9-6.
She said, "Things have changed and I'm not calling in my othe girl just for you.
You're not even paying for it so I'm not going to pay her.
"  Nice way to treat a new customer!
AND it says gratuity is mandatory (breaks NV law) on the certificate anyway.
I'm going to work on getting a refund for the certificate somehow.
Avoid this woman and her so-called "business" at all costs.
Not professional and just not a nice person.
I understand her father died 6 weeks ago but if you are going through emotional problems don't take it out on your customers.
