I was *really* impressed with Buchanan Chiropractic - AND I visted here after purchasing a Groupon.
So often I have found that Groupon deals result in a sub par experience but that was far from the case here.
The girl at reception was lovely and friendly and very accomodating when I was booking an appointment, and the facilities were clean and well set-up.
The stand out though, was Isla, my masseuse.
She took time to go through my form (I'm used to that never being looked at when I've had other massages!
) and ask me a few additional questions about my back pain, causes, etc.
She was incredibly aware of the back/body/muscles on me as an individual and tailored the massage for my own aches and pains rather than just running through a routine.
She practices a number of different types of massage and clearly enjoys what she does, resulting in what sounds like quite a few regulars who she enjoys working with because she enjoys freeing people from their pain and generally making them feel better.
I absolutely didn't want my session to end.
Deep Tissue is not generally known as being relaxing but she managed to get deep into my muscles without causing pain and making it a wonderful and relaxing experience.
She finished by showing me a few stretches which would help to open up my muscles and help to alleviate desk-job related aches and pains.
I was so impressed.
I've been to a  few masseuses and I've never before been so impresed with someone's skill.
I definitely plan to return (though, when they're having a sale... it's a bit on the pricey side!

Great realignment... Nice and professional staff... Great massages too!
