they came out once and told us they needed to do some research on our unit and said they'd get back to us.
a week plus goes by and no word.
we called them back on a Friday and they said they would call on Monday, Had to call them back.
they send out a different tech who tells me that he needs to do some research and will call us back.
they show up when they say and are courteous to talk to just not well organized and take way too long.
we are calling someone else

Awful....400 percent mark-up ...go anywhere else

I had an issue with drainage in my attic from a broken pan related to the HVAC system.
From start to finish, Allstate was top notch.
The person I spoke with on the phone several time was extremely helpful in scheduling and explaining what was going on to me.
Both of the techs who came out were knowledgeable, friendly, and very respectful at our home.
I have no point of reference for their price, but I have no complaints.
I would absolutely use them again.

Their technicianwas atmy housewithin 45 minutes ofmy callin SanTan Valley.
Jeremy was friendly,  quick and efficient.
He knew the problem in minutes and the repairs were completed quickly.
I had a cold house Weirton 1.5 hours from my call for repairs.
I got five star service, but gave them for stats because it was a bit pricey,  but for me it was worth it to not have to wait and have friendly service.
