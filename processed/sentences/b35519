This is a McDonald's.
The food tastes the same no matter which one you go to, and it's perfectly fine for a late-night fast food fix.
However, this one will never give you the correct food.
Even if employees outnumber patrons three to one, you had better open up every box to make sure you get what you ordered.
Not just look in the bag.
Look in the boxes.
The employees are friendly enough when you point out their mistakes.
It's not like they're maliciously screwing up your order.
But an order consisting of a Double Quarter-pounder with cheese (yes, that's TWO WHOLE PATTIES, WITH CHEESE), two apple pies and an order of fries should not be difficult to assemble.
You want an Angus burger?
It's a toss-up whether what comes on the burger is even close to what you ordered.
I don't want to think about what this place turns into during the lunch rush.

Ok, we all know Mcdonalds is good for having to endure horrible attitudes, missing food and more attitudes when you complain.
Well the first time I was right as usual lol!
The lady who took my order was as rude and just plan ugh as she could be!
I had to come back because she left out nearly everything I ordered.
So I came back and she was like oh I apologize in such a somber voice and offered 3 dollar menu coupons (Take it they keft out almost 10 dollars worth of food).
I took it and gave the manager a call the nest day and she was very apologetic and had me come in.
She not only remade my order but asked me anything that I wanted and added it to it.
All said and done I left out with almost 50 bucks of free food!
So Kudos to them!
Thanks!
