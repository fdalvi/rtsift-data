Excellent service!
Van is so nice and helpful.
We bring our clothes here for cleaning and alterations and have never been disappointed!

Van is such a nice person and totally committed to quality.
I discovered her after discovering Nosh restaurant/bar next door so I tried her out and made the switch from a cleaner I've been using for years.
great to have really persona; quality service!

I was in Chandler AZ visiting family and needed a quick repair on my pants...bend, split, opps.
Found Vans cleaners and alterations online.
Took my pants to get fixed and the lady there, Van, was super friendly and as a bonus she did a great job fixing my pants!
Wish the store was closer to home, id be a regular for sure!

There were so helpful and so fast when I needed to have a couple dresses altered.
They had some great ideas and were very friendly and honest.
They gave me good advice not to alter a certain way because it increased the price of the alteration.
Most places try to trick you into doing the more expensive option,

Van is very experienced.
She has fixed quit a few of my nice dresses.
She replaces zippers and her prices are unbeatable!!
I take all if my alterations to this shop.
I have also used her dry cleaning services.
She rocks!
