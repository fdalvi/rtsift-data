Just to clarify, my rating for this business is not based on the quality of their work, but based on their service.
The problem I had with them is that I never got any service.
I called them on a Thursday to see if they can do a rush order for me because I needs shirts made by Sunday.
The service rep promised everything will be done by Friday and that he'd call me to let me know it's done.
He called on Friday afternoon to tell me that it won't be done until Saturday and he'll come in on Saturday to finish the job.
Of course, no calls on Saturday and Sunday, so I missed the deadline where I could've order from another place and actually got the shirts in time!
The rep finally called me on Monday to "confirm" that I still want the shirts.
Wow thanks Sherlock!!!
I needed those shirts bleeping yesterday!!!
Anyways, I don't recommend businesses that over-promise and under-deliver.

I needed a single item printed and Forrest was super helpful.
He even had me email him the text and had it ready to go when I got there with the sweatshirt.
I'm sure single items aren't the norm but next time I have a bigger order I'll be bringing it to them too.

I had the same problem as Allan H. I was not in any kind of rush for my shirts.
I gave them 2 weeks to print my shirts.
I got no calls on the day the shirts were suppose to be ready.
I left several phone messages and finally sales person called me back.
He wanted to see if I still want my shirts print .
Can't count on this place!
