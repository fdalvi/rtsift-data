Fazio Cleaners is my favorite cleaners in Las Vegas.
I come here often and it is close to the hotel I like to stay in.
The staff in this location is amazing and they are the nicest people around.
It seems like they know all of their customers personally.
They offer dry cleaning, laundering, fold and wash and practically any alterations that are possible.
They also do all alterations on site, so you don't have to worry about your clothes being sent off and disappearing.
They're very fast and conveniently on the corner at the bus stop.
Highly recommended for all

I am very happy with their service and I have been taking my drycleaning there for a number of years.

This place just takes the cake.....
I work as a personal assistant to a Surgeon and bring his laundry and dry cleaning here.
They know me by name, I never give directions as to how to clean his clothes, nor remind them of the phone number attached to the account--these chicks have it down!
Prices are steep but the quality is exceptional!
