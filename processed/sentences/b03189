This is very near to my place.
Not crowded and good place to do your quick shopping.

I don't know why I went down here to old people land.
Oh, I know, because it's the same distance to another Basha's, and I know this one is generally less busy.
I grabbed my 10 items or less and headed to the front.
It was very early and there was only one register open.
As I paid I got $40 cash back and you would have thought I personally took it out of the cashier's pocket.
She huffed and puffed and grumbled about how the last guy gave her a hundred and she's cleaned out again....
Sounds to me like you NEED to get cleaned out, but that's beside the point.
I smiled and said, "Sorry to put you out.
"  She crossed her arms and pouted.
I'm thinkin', isn't that why they pay someone $1.00/hour more than her, to be called a front end manager and go get more change?
Hmmm.
Kinda feel sorry for her the more that I think about it.
The front end manager probably doesn't like her either.

Stopped by to pick up some stuff for a pool party.
Grabbed some beer, homemade tortilla chips and salsa.
Omg!
So Good!
The tortilla chips were some of the best I've ever had.
If I'm ever in town again and need to pick up some food or drinks, I'll definitely go back to this place
