My Favorite Shop: I have been a long time fan of this company.
It wasn't until a misplaced suite jacket led me to this location inside of Ceasar's Palace/Forum Shops that I realized how much I liked this store - especially this location.
We entered the shop about half an hour before they were to close.
After living in HI for so long I had misplaced most of my dress clothes.
I realized my dinner & show reservations for the next night asked that men wear a jacket.
Needless to say I needed help.
I am not one for shopping.
However, the selection & helpful staff were so great that I ended up with virtually a new wardrobe instead of just a jacket for the next night and happy about it.
Good lighting helped me find just the right hues & colors.
Wide designer selection provided the variety to dress well & not look like an ad for a specific designer.
I am especially fond of the house brand for dress pants.
The music was good.
The staff here was wonderful.
Helpful but not pushy.
The man helping us had a good eye for piecing together outfits for casual & dress occasions.
The sales associate even tracked down a cool drink for my girlfriend when needed.
The oversized chairs were a nice addition to rest in while awaiting suggestions from the salesman.
When I realized I had kept them there almost 45 minutes past closing I began my appologies & they assured me that it was their pleasure to assist.
WOW!
Many stores kick you out after a few minutes past closing & these men were as helpful & freindly as when we first walked in the door.
The tailor even had my clothes ready the very next day.
Great service.
All in all a terrific shopping experience.
I will most assuredly be shopping here again.

at first you think the clothes are good.
A pair of shoes I bought there actually tore in the back with-in the first 2 months.
They say everything is Italian made, wrong, pay attention, quite a bit is actually Made in China.
