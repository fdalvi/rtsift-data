I'm not on this side of town very often but I was craving a pizza and very happy to see something other domino's or pizza hut or papa john's.
I really am a big fan of Hungry Howies.
Just can't put my finger on what it was about this location.
The pizza was okay (pepperoni with garlic crust).
And they really seem to know their regulars.
All in all, the pie did what I needed it to do.
I'll be back I'm sure.

Wasn't that good,, tasted a lot like Pizza Hut,, really wasn't worth the price.... You can tell they use frozen dough....
The sauce tasted like it came straight from the can.. Just wanted to try it once,, but I assure you I will never go back....
I can make a better pizza at home....

Went time hungry howies because i was craving their garlic crust pizza.
Got home and my pizza had regular crust!
So pissed.
Would've went somewhere else with better pizza in general if I wanted regular crust.
Also, the guy who took my call rang us up for the wrong price.
Got there and the other guy noticed and took 5$ off.
I dont like a lot of sauce, but my pizza literally tasted like there wasnt any sauce on it at all.
My boyfriend asked for extra sauce on his pizza and he said it didnt seem like they put any extra on.
Never had a pizza messed up anywhere before last night.
I hope they figure this out because I like hungry howies.
