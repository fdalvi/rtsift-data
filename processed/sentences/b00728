The people here at this store are soooo helpful.
I needed new windshield wipers (like everyone does here in AZ right after monsoon season starts and you realize the hard bricks of rubber you've had on there since last year are not going to cut it!).
I don't know what was going on with me, but I was confused about what to buy and even how to put them on...the directions on the back were cryptic!
The guy came outside to my car, showed me how to put them on and then did it for me.
yea!
A few months before this happened, our battery was going dead and they helped me install a new one!!
I love these guys!
Excellent service!!

Yelp, get with it, please....Checker on 7th St is now O'Reilly & that's who I'm trying to write a review for.....thanks!
:)  In any case, I came in to the 7th St location today as my battery was sputtering & on its last breath and that's where I'd bought it previously.
Sue was the employee helping me & was patient enough to look under several different phone numbers to see if my battery was still under warranty.
It wasn't (groan in my head, money signs in front of my eyes) but she did me a solid & applied it to my case so that instead of paying $100 for the new battery, I was only out $60.
Beyond her willingness to help me, she was friendly & quick.
I definitely recommend this location to anyone looking for help who's car savvy and maybe not so car savvy (me).

Good price on a new battery with free installation.
Jamie provided outstanding customer service.
