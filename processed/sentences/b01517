I have searched and searched for a dentist in the North Valley...and I was happy to find these guys a few years ago.
They are very thorough, and they don't try to sell you things you don't need.
I had a great dentist in Chandler, but after moving up to North Phoenix, it seemed that every dentist I went to want to do extra work and some didn't even want to clean my teeth.
I am a 'teeth person' and take my dental work seriously.
I wasn't thrilled when they told me I had a cavity last week, but then again they had been 'watching' these teeth for over year, so I know when he said I needed to get it filled, I really do need a filling.
While cavities and fillings aren't my idea of a 'great way to start your day;' I don't mind it with these guys.

My family has been using this dental office for over 10 years now!
The staff really cares about their patients.
I love this place.
Not a fan of getting dental work done but I surely wouldn't do it anywhere else

The only way to say it hes the best dentist in Az.
and, Its always nice that dental specialists mention his name very reverentially and respectfully.
the man is a giant in dentistry.
