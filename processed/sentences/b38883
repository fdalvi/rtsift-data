So, I Had The Gyro I was Pretty good I had better & I had worst.
The Pita Bread was soft they gave you a good amount of meat  the Tzatziki Sauce didn't have a lot of flavor kinda plan but once again I had worst.
The atmosphere was nice only been open 3 days so It's still clean hope it stays that way.
I will go back for sure

So, I Had The Steak Sha-Wirma.
It was horrible.. Really horrible.
Very Dry, Not A Good Flavor At All.
Even The Garlic Sauce They Have With It Didn't Help.
I Took 3 Bites Had To Toss The Rest In The Trash.
A Waste Of $7 bucks.
Also Had The Chicken Gyro Here Before & The Regular Gyro.
The Chicken Was Not Go Either Would Not Get It Again The Regular Gyro Was Ok, But If You Come Here I Would Say Away From The Steak Sha-Wirma & The Chicken Gyro.

I figured I would just try the generic gyro.
Maybe I was really hungry.
Maybe I just wanted to cheat on my diet.
Maybe it was free because a friend got it for me.
I don't know, but I really liked it and will go back.
A friend also shared their falafel and I've never had one, but she lived in Greece a zillion years ago and apparently she likes it.

Just ate here.
I ordered the Hummus and a Greek salad.
It was excellent and fresh!
I would gladly return!
I have eaten a lot of Mediterranean food and I have to say the hummus was among the best!

Move over, Pita Jungle, hello Gyro Express!!!
I've been here twice already, and so far, it's been great!
I don't remember what I ordered (I know, that's sad), but I can tell you it was the number nine combo.
If you like a lot of meat in your pitas like I do, then this is definitely the place to go!
Let me put it to you this way:  I'm a pretty big eater, so I can put away a lot of food, and I have a hard time finishing my sandwich here.
Food is great.
If you're looking to try Greek/Mediterranean food for the first time, want something fast, or really don't want to venture to Pita Jungle, then come here!
