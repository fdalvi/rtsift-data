I needed three appliances repaired so I thought I could save some money if I got them done by one company.
So I made an appointment for the next day from 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm.
The next morning they called to change the appointment to 11:00 am to 2:00 pm, OK I'll switch m am business to pm.
So I wait from 8:00 am to 2:10 pm without any calls or repairman.
Finally I heard from them at 3:03 to say they couldn't make it!

I would never call this company again.
Their prices are outrageous, they don't honor appointment times, and they don't follow through with repairs.
They changed the appointment 3 times without calling to update me.
I had to call them to ask where they were.
I agreed to pay an exorbitant amount to get an appliance fixed because I just wanted get it over with and didn't want to pay another service call fee from another company.
A few days later, when I called to confirm the follow up service to complete the repair, they said they hadn't even ordered the part yet.
Incompetence.
I had them cancel everything.
Waste of time and money.
According to their website, they have 3 offices--Henderson, Summerlin, and North Las Vegas.

So I'm a bit confused about the reviews on here, because my experience with Comfort Home Appliance was AWESOME.
Not to mention, they have excellent reviews on Google as well.
But anyway, I called and made an appt.
this morning and they were out here same day.
The person that scheduled the appt.
was very polite.
Before they came out, they called again to confirm the appt.
My service tech was Eddie and he was completely professional and very knowledgeable.
Not to mention, he took a look at something else that was broken in my house as well.
He could not have been any nicer.
I wish all repair companies were this efficient.
Thanks again Eddie!
Oh - and prices were completely reasonable.
I think my service fee was $69.
