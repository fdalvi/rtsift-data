Very friendly staff, who often accommodates this box holder, because I'm forever forgetting my key.
They also make keys.
Love this place.

The map picture for this one is incorrect.
This location is actually at Alma School and Germann, in the Fry's plaza.
I'll give a place 3 strikes before I say something heavily negative, and this is it for this joint.
One employee, Jim, has ruined it for me.
I don't know if he's just an old school chauvinist, or if he's deeply insecure and mean-spirited, but he's waited on me 3 times.
Every time condescending and rude.
And the last time I was so irritated, I just wanted to get out of there and when I got to the car I realized he didn't give me my change.
It was only a nickel, so no big deal.
I hope he can use that towards a customer service class.
If he's not there, it's fine and I like all the services that The UPS Store offers.
I used to travel all over the country for a company who has a corporate account with them and I would always get A+ service no matter where I went.
In the future I will use a different location.

Just dropped off a pre-paid label package.
A young lady was on duty.
Very cheerful.
This was a dead-easy transaction.
Drop off package, get receipt.
Other than having to wait in line (there was one person ahead of me), it was quick and easy.
