Clean, simple, tons of machines, always working, not even that busy on the weekends... it's a great laundromat.
5 stars would be for a place that has something ridiculous (free wifi, drinks, etc.)...
but this is no frills, simple quality.
Now go do your laundry, you're smelling a little ripe.

I have no idea what I was expecting from a laundromat, but the 5 star yelp rating made me think of laundry mecca.
The floors were not clean and had a bunch of socks and dryer sheets everywhere.
The worst part I guess was the smell.
Extremely pungent combination of detergent and overall yukiness.
I still can't believe we made the 5 mile trek there... And just waltzed right out.
However, the machines did look fairly new.
It's not worth the trip from downtown imo.
