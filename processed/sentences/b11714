I love port of subs.. My man and I go to them all the time.
Cheap, fast, and better than subway.
This location was great.
Clean and friendly.

This food here is good.
They always make my sandwich the way that I order it and the prodcuts are always fresh.
I think I'm giving it low stars because of the area.
Scary people around here...

Don't waste your time or money at this port of subs.
It closes whenever the owner decides she wants it to without notice and without regard to her customers.
I complained and instead of taking the initiative and saying she was sorry, she was condescending.
The owner does not appreciate her customers and would rather save a buck than satisfy her customers.
I won't go back.

We ate there today and the food is great.
Sandwich made exactly as we ordered.
Very clean inside and very friendly employees.
We will definitely go back!

Every time I come here everyone is upbeat, cheerful, and they make great subs!
Most of the employees have been working there for years and you can tell that they love working there which means there is great ownership!
They make an exceptional sandwich as well.
Can't go wrong when you want a quick and easy lunch!
