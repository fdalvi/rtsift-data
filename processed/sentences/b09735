Just a run of the mill Subway.
Ate there last week and noticed a good size cockroach run under the chip rack.
I don't think I will be back...

Always clean.

Great service and the freshest of ingredients.
The guys who work here are really on top of things, and provided me with a great experience, not to mention a fantastic sandwich.

They make a typical good sandwich...
I go to this particular store because the staff is so sweet.

Nice store.
The lady who took my order was having a lot of conversation with her fellow employees as opposed to listening to the order.
All the tables were dirty and needed to be cleaned.
My wife doesn't like to bring food home because she would rather enjoy right after being made.
We wont eat in again because we had to listen to the staff gossip and eat at a dirty table.
Food was consistent with other subways but run by children.
