It has finally been put out of its misery.
Ralph's is closed.
There's an urgent care there now.

Not sure why I am defending a place that is closed but once upon a time, when Ralph still owned the joint, it was a good place to eat then they sold it to Long Wong's and it went right into the dumper.
Oh well I still have some fond memories of the place.

I gotta side with Ricardo, even if for no other reason than I have nothing better to do right now than write reviews of restaurants that no longer exist for my own entertainment (and hopefully yours).
20 years ago, we lived in a small community 2 hours away from Ralph's.
There was a neighborhood pact...if anyone was headed for the Phoenix area, they took orders from every household on the street and picked up a truckload of Ralph's pizzas and brought them back for everybody.
Ralph still cooked and the pizza was amazing.
The atmosphere was great and Ralph was friendly and sweet.
Whoever got it from him drove it right into the ground and our pizza experience has never been the same.
Goodbye, Ralph's!
