My girlfriend got us a couples massage at Haven and it was absolutely superb.
First we were treated with a nice foot soak.
While we were soaking our feet they brought in Fresh Strawberries and Champagne.
Being from Wisconsin, Alcohol always ads to the experience!
After the Foot Soak we were treated to an hour of pure bliss.
The Massages were great.
Shelly and Christine did a great job.
I liked how they asked a lot of questions so they could really focus on the areas of your body that are important to you.
Nice Job!

Shelly (Michele Duncan Hadley) is excellent.
I don't get massages too frequently, but I think this one was the best I have ever had.
She seemed much more aware of the underlying anatomy than your average MT - just hit every spot perfectly.
A real pro.
She also listens - it seems with many other massages I have had that the pre- and during-massage instructions (pressure, problem areas, etc.
) have little impact on the actual massage I receieved; not so with Shelly - again, just a pro at what she does.
The spa is nice - comfortable, quiet, everything you'd expect.
I found the prices reasonable too.

Hallelujah, I feel amazing!!
just wanted to thank my massage therapist for doing an awesome job!!!
I needed this today...

These people are fantastic.
My wife and I got a couples massage right before our wedding day.
After several stressful months of planning, working, and me attending grad school, we were walking knots.
They are so attentive to your needs and really know what they are doing without you asking.
The gentleman who took care of me, Greg, recognized I had a lot of tension in my neck and right shoulder and diligently worked out several knots from the area.
We left feeling completely rejuvenated and went back just two weeks later to celebrate my wife's birthday.
What an amazing experience and wonderful people!
