Best Ice Cream around!!
And every time i go in, they have something new on the menu (the frozen hot chocolate is to DIE for)!
Can't wait to get there for breakfast!
Super friendly staff and cool decorations!

I tell all my customers about the super cool ice cream cafe just down the street from my store.
Great prices and nifty, Thrifty ice cream!!!!
Plus, what an ideal family environment with a large chalk board, board games and electronic games.
I need to try that Frozen Hot Chocolate next time I am in.

Excellent ice cream shop.
Customer service is top notch.
Very friendly and welcoming!
Great decor and a bunch of table top games to play with family or friends while you enjoy some Thrifty ice cream or one of their other great, unique creations.
Monday nights are $1 scoops as well, and they are more often than not generous in their scoop sizes.

Went there Saturday (7/27/13) around 2 pm and the doors were locked.
Would love to try this new place but this is the second time this has happened to us.

We decided to visit it after a friend told us all about it.
We went after "meet the teacher night" at our school in Mesa, It was so worth the drive!
Will be going back alot more.
Cant wait ill they have hot dogs.
