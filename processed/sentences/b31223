Great little dealership in South Scottsdale.
Took care of me along every step of the way and did not pressure me at the slightest.
Never gave me those annoying calls trying to get my business.
Ended up buying a truck from them at a great price.
The truck needed some brake work after I bought it, and they were more than happy to fix it for me at no cost.
They usually have a great truck selection!

They were awesome.
Dealt with Mike and Jobi.
Seriously was the smoothest, lowest hassle dealership experience I've had and I've looked at a lot of cars.
They simply gave me the best deal for the car I was looking for.
HIGHLY would recommend checking them out.

Worst company I have ever dealt with.
They shot my credit out to all theses banks and then I get a call from a bank saying that I was interested in a car at a Honda dealership I told them I never been to a Honda dealership, come to find out they gave my info to a Honda dealership and shot it out to all theses banks.
I still have not heard from the dealership I have tried to call and they keep ignoring my calls!
Stay away from this place!
this is what gives car dealerships bad names!
