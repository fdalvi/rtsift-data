Tried to stop for a quick car lunch on the way to court.
10 minutes later I'm trapped in line and still hungry.
Slowest fast food in America.

This place is delicious I love their buffet its always fresh, if you need anything Mari the manager will go above and beyond to make your experience a good one.
Plus the dining area is always clean.
Might not be a high end restaurant but I always know my meal will be a good one there.

I don't know what it is about this place, but they are bound and determined to get your order wrong.
I don't know how many times I have come here and asked for no lettuce and every flippin time , there is lettuce!
I have had to drive all the way back from San Tan Valley a few times to have them correct an order on other things as well.
Just make sure you check your bag before you leave the drive thru or you will have to come back.
And the drive thru is SUUUUUPPEERRR SLOW!!!
You figure all the time they take preparing your order, they could at least get it right.
I actually have a picture that I posted on fb of one particular order  that said on the reciept, "No lettuce" and guess what is just raining out of the wrapper all over my vehicle?
LETTUCE!!!
There is no excuse for service that slow, that can't even get the order right.
I haven't been back there in about 2 years and won't go back.
I'd rather drive all the way to Casa Grande to get my fix of tasty KFC chicken.
And don't get me started on the Taco Bell side of things at this location.... Bleh!
