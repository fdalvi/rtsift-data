They just got a face lift.
The place looks good and 2 drive thurs lanes now.
Still the same good and level of service.

Awful service and such a slow drive thru.
Not coming back.
Ordered a smoothie and they let me order, pay, and wait at the other window until they figured out they don't have any...
I sat at the drive thru window several minutes before someone even opened it and acknowledged me and there was a line behind me!
They definitely don't move with much purpose.

Horrible service for being a fast food chain.
Horrible drive thru for late night eating.
I'd rather go to the McDonalds on 99th and lower buckeye.
Never want to come back here.
Ever!

Dirty, tables not clean.
No mirror in bathroom.
Very surprised.
Usually the best place to stop for clean facilities

this McDonald's is one of the busiest ones in the valley.
Service & Cleanliness can be 100% spot on... And then they get hit with a zillion kids and/or movie goers.
In 30 minutes the place looks like it's gone to hell in a hand basket.
So one minute service is just peachy, another and they don't seem to have enough employees..
But there will be lines out of the double laned drive up  window and crowds around the counter...  As a regular there, they do an admirable job but will always have nay sayers at this and similar locations... of any fast food restaurants.
