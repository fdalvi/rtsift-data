The cleaners arrived early and did a wonderful job.
My carpet looks like new and that's hard to image with 5 pets and 2 kids!
They finished in under 2 hours and left shoe covers for us to wear until the carpet dried.
They were also very affordable.
I would recommend them to anyone!

I called Mustang the day before I needed them to clean my 7 ft couch with numerous pillows and my 4 ft oversized chair with ottoman.
They arrived on time and spent quite a bit of time working on getting the pet hair and stains out.
In the end I'm really happy with the results and shall be calling them when I need my carpets and tile done too.

Mustang got the call in the morning and was able to come to my home by afternoon to steam & deodorize 3 rooms of carpet.
They were careful, tidy and thorough, all much appreciated!
They also did a fantastic job of cleaning up light colored grout and tile of a very very dirty rental.
Thanks guys :D
