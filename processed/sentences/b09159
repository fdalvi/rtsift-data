Bummed it doesn't carry the higher end baking chocolate that I use, but eh...can't have it all, can I?
This store is definitely a bit on the older side and not brand spankin' new like other grocery stores.
It does the job all right for being the closest one, but when I feel like I need a bit more variety and am stifled in my choices, I go to Fry's a bit further down the road.

I wish I could give this store 0/5 but it won't let me so it gets one star.
I went in here a few times after work and got stuck in line for seriously 15 minutes plus!
While talking to another customer in line about sports, movies, the neighborhood and work we eventually touched off on how this store used to be in the past.
Apparently there used to be self-checkout stands but they removed them.
Removed them?
Why on earth?
Anyways, having one cashier on the clock and no self-checkout stands is a recipe for disaster and poor customer service.
