the workers are really nice and helpful and the plus is that they give you suggestions and advice with your purchases but as of clothes and what not, I'd rather go to forever 21 or i dont know like rue 21 for better quality and same price.

Some cute and affordable stuff.
They are very helpful here.
In fact, the staff is almost too helpful.
They hover a bit and try to get me to buy some membership discount card.
I do not appreciate the high pressure pushing.
I just want a new top or a cheap pair of shorts.

Really really bad service!
Girls are snobby & they get super defensive when I start asking about promos.
Its unfortunate cause their prices are really good.
But I would rather drive all the way to the other one than come here (5mins away) cause I love shopping & it definitely doesnt feel comfortable shopping here.

Walked in and no one greeted me although I saw about 3 girls that worked there that I know for a fact saw me.
They gave a look like I shouldn't be shopping there.
No one was helpful and it's a shame too because I was in there to do a little shopping for my daughters birthday.
One thing I will not tolerate is bad customer service which starts the second you walk into an establishment.
Will not go back!
