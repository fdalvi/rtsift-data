My hubby and his father "fixed" the constant running of water from the guest bathroom toilet.
Funny, how it was running again after my FIL leaves.
I swear it was just story telling and drinking.
LOL!
Anyways, I told my hubby get it fix or sleep in the tub!
The running water was driving me crazy.
He found Johnco online and give them a call.
Our tech, Jason came out and fixed the issue.
On his way out, my hubby asked him about the leaking drip system and if he knew anyone to fix it.
He gave us 2 options.
We took the cutting off supply to the drip system, since we were not using it anyways.
About 1 day later the toilet was leaking water outside this time.
Oh boy, this is not good.
We called and left a message.
Then we call again the next day, they asked a series of questions.
They sent out the same tech.
He explained the issue and fix it for GOOD.

These guys bailed me out!
After another plumbing company pulled a no-show, Johnco came in and got the job done (and I didn't have to take another morning off of work).
The technician (Jason) was courteous, quick, and explained that my garbage disposal had done its job, but that it had just reached the end of its life.
he was prepared with a replacement, and was able to swap out old with new in about 45 minutes.
He also walked over the warranty information, and how to ensure I got the full two year warranty.
After missing a morning of work and being a bit upset, Johnco saved the day.
Highly recommended!

Great guy, I thought my garbage disposal was a goner but only filled with   miscellaneous debris thanks to my clueless college son.
Only charged me a minimum fee.
Honest operation.
