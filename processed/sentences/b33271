The owners Heidi and john present themselves as if they are a small friendly little boutique.
Nothing could be further from the truth!
I purchased a clock (highly overpriced) on dec 23rd on dec 26 went in to return.
The website and receipt shows that you may return or exchange within 30 days.
Heidi in particular was so nasty, she stated she would not accept a return just exchange.
The box was unopened yet she randomly decides what will be returned or exchanged.
She rudely informed me that she is through speaking about it and indicated our conversation is over!
Unbelievable !
She indicated that I should leave the store and yelled a snotty remark as I exited.
I am so disgusted by this treatment of a customer that I went directly to mall management.
These people have no integrity and do not back up anything they state on their website.
No One should give them a dime!

Ran into this place by accident, apparently it's the same owners and store they ran in Gilbert.
It's still overpriced and under stocked.
The owner Heidi is as nasty as ever.
I guess they can move wherever but her poor customer service stays with her.
Don't bother spending your time nor money with this outfit.
