Smoke-filled bathrooms, gross food, even if the burgers are a buck.
Expensive bowling, but on the upside, only one of the bartenders is a tool.

Its a hick bowling alley.
Cheap bar food.

I was there on Monday December 30, 2013.
And I will NEVER be back again.
I waited nearly ten minutes for a person to show up at the counter.
I just wanted a lane and some shoes.
We were told to go to number 8.
When it was not on, we went back to the counter.
No one was there.
I waited another 5 minutes.
I then went into the bar where I found our person too busy to do his job because he was drinking.
From his vantage point he could not see if people were coming in.
In addition to that, he kept pointing and telling me number 8 was on.
He could not see number 8 and was just aimlessly pointing.
Most likely he was drunk.
Spartan Bowl, get some better staff.
Perhaps ensure that your staff can stay sober.
