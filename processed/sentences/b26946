THE WORST Company EVER~!
Cancel my phone & internet in Feb 2011, they kept billing me until July.
I called twice every month telling them I have cancel and to stop taking $ from my bank account.
They tell me, my canceling order is pending & frozen in their system with an error.
So FIX IT.
They can't fix it & spend me to every damn department to get it fix.
Still not fix & it's Sept.
Trying to get my refund is a joke.
No one knows what's going on in my case.
I tell them there should be LOTS of notes on my acct.
They just keep transferring me to other departments.
Or tell me to hold & get disconnected.
Please wait about a month.
Everything should be fix by then.
Well it's SEPT and NOTHING IS FIX YET.
I still didn't get my refund of $354.69 This company is ridiculous.
Update: Sept 29 Call back today and still no refund.
Still can't fix the problem & give me, my refund.
Now they have another BS to give me.
I think I heard it all from them =T   UPDATE: 10/25/11 Call today 1st agent didn't know what he was talking about give me mad BS & didn't even ask for my name or acct #.
Transferred me to another department.
They said to wait 90 days.
I told them I been waiting since FEB to now.
SO she transferred me to another department.
All that agent can say is that is our policy you just have to wait there isn't anything we can do about it.
Are you serious this is so beyond RIDICULOUS~!
Update: 11/4 still waiting for my check.
=T   Update finally got a check in Jan 2012, Waited almost a full year to get my refund and no interest no apology from them nothing.

Worst company I have ever had the misfortune of having to deal with.
A salesman told me internet would cost $30/month.
They called back 2 days later to offer me internet for $45/month plus the cost of a router.
Finally, a few hours later I was told it would be $50/month.
I will never deal with century link for anything due to the incompetence of their employees.

Cheaper than cox and for obvious reasons!!!!
Century link is horrible, first off I waited almost 2 weeks for them to come out and hook up my service.
The technician that came out was actually super nice, knew what he was doing, great customer service.
I signed up for  cable, phone, and internet with them.
besides the face that my bill changed each month,  and I noticed I was getting charged for using *69 (which I had added the *69 feature) and when I called to inquire about that and why my bill was dramatically different.
The rep I spoke with told me that I did in fact have the feature however I never called to activate it so I had been charged each time I had used it, and then she gave me several reasons to why my billing was always another amount each month.
I then requested for them to cancel my service and pick up their equipment  and I called cox and had them connect my services again yet I continued to get bills from century link, each time I called ( about 4 times total) to have them cancel my service they said ok and someone would pick up the equipment, 5 months later I am now getting calls and letters from collections and I still have the equipment sitting in my apartment waiting to be picked up.
I even told them I work in the office where I live so they can call me or stop by the office to pick it up if I am not home.
This company is a joke cox may not be the best company but century link is the WORST!!!

BEWARE!!
Even if you get a decent monthly rate when you sign up, they will add various fees.
When I called I specifically told them that I only needed a few months of service.
They quoted me a rate, then when I received my first bill there was a connection fee (around $25 I believe), then after I cancelled my service after the two months I needed, they charged me a CANCELLATION fee as well!

I contacted them via email about the hidden charges.
They refunded the disconnect fee.

they say if you type something in capitals you are either yelling or emphasizing.
in my situation it is both!!
so hear me loudly...***the worst service ever!
***  i can sit here and write this long list of things that they've done wrong.
but for anyone to take the time out to write these things is just enough said!
escalation is a joke.
all it means is we have a lot of other clients more important than you!
even though we know that you are at our mercy, that doesn't matter what matters is that we are going to make the calling center so difficult that you will just have to call in 3-4 times after being transferred all over the usa to the wrong departments!
and there is nothing you can say or do but wait!
