Dr.  litchfield  is  the  best  Endocrinologist.
A  very  brilliant,  caring  and  respectful  person.
He takes  the  time  needed  for  a  proper  diagnosis,  listening  to  his  patients  in  detail.
He's  also  an  authority  on  scanning  procedures  and  does  them  in  office.
His  bedside  manner  is  comforting  and  kind.
I  recommend  him  without  hesitation

I just switched practices because of how rude and unhelpful the office staff is .
This is by far the worst doctors office I have ever had to deal with.
They over billed me by 800.00 dollars and took 3 months to get it back to me after countless calls and complaints.
If you have the option to go elsewhere ,  do it!!!

The staff at this location just take the cake.
They are pure rude just unkind so not humble or friendly people.
How can they help people with such nasty attitudes its beyond me.
How they have a job at all is beyond me.
I will never return here.

I've been with Dr. Litchfield at the Horizon Ridge (Henderson) office for seven years.
He treats me for hypothyroidism which has been very unmanageable and resistant to the usual treatments.
He has been patient and willing to try options other than Synthroid.
His office staff has been wonderful to deal with and the office has been very cooperative in dealing with my compounding pharmacy.
It takes a long time to get in to see Dr. Litchfield but I feel the wait is worth it.
I say this as a person whose condition has not markedly improved.
Despite that, in my opinion, I feel I have received great treatment.
