Jeff Caler's office is easily the best insurance agency I have ever had.
The staff is super friendly & very helpful.
I was referred to them by my old agent in Ohio & they truly are great.
I have my car, home & life insurance with them.
You should call them too!

Great customer service, competitive rates, and I always get a call right back from Jeff!
Nice to have an agent who actually cares about his customers.
I would recommend giving him a call.

Jeff and his staff are great..
They really have a personal touch with their customers.
The staff has been very responsive to any request I have ever made, and Jeff is a tremendous resource... not just for home/auto insurance, but also for financial services and advice.
Jeff also has a great network of contractors/vendors he works with in the area, and he is always helpful with a referral.
He has helped me with plumbers, A/C, contractors, etc..; he helped me get some dings removed from my car inexpensively without having to file a claim, he gave me good advice on buying a new car and financing it.
Like A Good Neighbor... with Jeff it is not just a marketing slogan, it is the way he does business.
