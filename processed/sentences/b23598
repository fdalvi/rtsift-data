Fantastic.
I'll never consider anyone else for a flooring job.
Highest quality products and very competitive prices.
I had them put mostly laminate boards and some tile throughout my remodeled home.
They took the time to make sure the laminate was laid exactly right (ie.
no bouncing, no clacking).
They even pulled up a large section and re-laid it when they realized it wasn't perfect.
There was one minor issue, but the owner came right out and fixed it when I pointed it out.
I wish dealing with all contractors went like this.
I highly recommend Custom Floor Covering.
Ask for Mike Thompson.

I had them I install patio carpet in April and I am still waiting for them to come and finish the job.
It was all wrinkled and I have been promised an adjustment for months.
Phone calls, emails galore and no action.
I will never use this company again.

Very Slippery!!
Buyers Beware!!

I had travertine installed throughout my home the week after Christmas.
I was impressed from the moment I walked into the Custom Floor Covering showroom.
Andy took the time to educate me about stone flooring; Doug came a few days later to give me an estimate; and a few days after that, the work began.
I was very fortunate to have Charlie do the installation because he is a master craftsman.
The end result is beautiful!
