I learned of this company through a living social deal.
I emailed them to set up an appointment.
The earliest available date was a month later, I went ahead and scheduled the appointment in spite of the wait time.
One month went by,  on the scheduled day of cleaning in which I was told they would arrive between 12 and 1... NO ONE shows up.
I wait, at 3:30 I email asking why was this scheduled appointment not kept?...
I've yet to get a response or an explanation.
There are many cleaning companies out there, my suggestion - try a different one than Maid 4 it all.

I heard about this company on a living social deal and thought I would give them a try.
I should have known when they didn't answer their phones and had no voice mail system that they really didn't have things too together!!
However, I emailed and sent them a message on Facebook.
They responded really fast to the email but weren't able to schedule me for another 5-6 weeks!
Two days before my scheduled appointment I emailed them to confirm that they would be coming that Friday morning.
I got a response that yes, I was scheduled and to expect them between 8-9am.
Friday came...and they NEVER showed up!
I tried to call them twice that morning and got a voice mail.
I left a message and never got a call back.
I sent them a message on Facebook-and no response!
I am not really sure the point to schedule appointments and then not show up or return calls!
This is extremely unprofessional and it just gives the business a BAD name!!
I wouldn't recommend even trying to contact this place...even if it is a screaming deal...you will end up wasting your time waiting for them to show up and calling a business that is poorly ran!

I also purchased a voucher through livingsocial.
I had left several messages and finally got a call back but missed it.
The message left (@ 8pm) stated they were 'in the office now' and provided another number.
I called right away and received the same mailbox that you get when you call the number on the voucher.
I have now left several messages over the past few weeks on both numbers - still no return call.
I have contacted livingsocial to advise them that this business may no longer be active.

After this company no showed for their scheduled appointment with me-I emailed them to tell them how unprofessional this was.
I got a response nearly 2 weeks later blaming a staff that had left the company and that she had canceled appointments and not told anyone ??
They said they would like to try to reschedule my appointment at a time that would work for me.
I scheduled another appointment but found out I had something come up for work.
I emailed them nearly 2 weeks in advance asking them to reschedule...no response!
I emailed them again a week later...no response!
This company is a JOKE!
Don't waist your time!
