Mint Locker has got to be one of the most convenient services available in Las Vegas.
The website is extremely user friendly and the service is entirely accommodating to me and my schedule!
Its honestly a wonder something like this didn't exist before!
Its SUCH a great idea.
Simply drop off when my dry cleaning when its good for me, place the order on my phone, and voila.
Done.
Goes without saying, but they did an excellent job with my items as well.
Affordable and easy, what else can you ask for?

Our condo complex just installed a couple lockers from Mint Locker this past week.
I tested it out and had my clothes returned in 1 day.
Everything was dropped into a secure locker and they sent me a text message when it was picked up and when it was returned.
10 shirts, 2 dresses and 2 coats for under $60.
Very impressed and I will be using the service weekly.
They provided a nice clothes bag for all my future orders as well.
No more trips to the dry cleaner!

I just started Using Mint-locker.
I was not sure how it was going to work at first, or how long the turnaround would be, I was amazed when the pile of clothes I left in a small locker came back pressed and perfectly clean in a reusable dry-cleaning bag, complete with dinner mint and receipt.
I continued to use this service regularly and the turn around was always within 2 days.
The last time I used it I received an email from the CEO explaining that they had found 2500~ dollars worth of unsigned checks in the back-pocket of one of my pants, they returned them to me promptly, whoops.
A+ Service Mint-locker, A+   You won't find many companies like this around anymore, use them!
