Any self respecting Edinburgh party goer knows there is a severe lack of open food outlets at 3am.
With the exception of the 24 hour Co-op, there isn't much choice.
That is where Morrison's Bakery comes in.
Open until 5 am, this legendary bakery is packed with drunkards at 3am buying pies and sausage rolls.
Everyone needs a bit of munch after a few drinks, and Morrison's provides that good bit of stodge you need to fill up your belly.
It's quite pricey though, Â£2 for a pie!
So obviously they cash in on the fact they are one of the only food outlets still open, for that reason they lose a star.
Morrison's Bakery, I salute you.

I'm often surprised by the amount of people inside whenever I pass in the wee hours of the morning, and how quickly I join them.
As Amy said, this place isn't cheap.
But you're paying for freshness and the mammoth electricity bills this place must have.
And unlike there High Street counterpart (overkill for Greggs maybe) the food is actually HOT when you buy it.

It is firstly of importance to note that this place cannot really be called a bakery, in that it does not sell bread, but instead acts as a takeaway.
As a result, if you come here to buy some bread you will leave disappointed.
The speciality of this shop is the pies it sells which are of great quality and very tempting.
However, in the sober hours of the day this place is purely and simply too expensive and indeed the staff do not expect much business except at peak hours during the day and you can often end up waiting a good while to be served.
Really I don't think this shop does enough to justify the price tags it holds and as a result I cannot recommend it because it isn't value for money.
