Great DJ service.
The guys were very professional and once the event started they knew how to get our guest up and having a good time.
You have to opt in and get the photo booth.
Our guest felt like celebrities.
These guys rock!

We used 8-Bit Entertainment for my friends wedding photo booth and it was great!
There are a ton of props to choose from and the quality of the photos are clear!
I would definitely recommend 8-Bit Entertainment to anyone!

Used 8-bit entertainment Photobooth for our wedding last week.
We are glad we got the scrapbook to look back at the pictures.
Plenty of cool props...must have for a wedding!

We had this company do a photo booth for our party and it was a huge hit.
Everyone had a blast taking photos and at one point we had 14 people in there!
They were kind, professional, and patient.
Highly recommended!

We had 8-Bit Entertainment DJ for our wedding from ceremony, cocktail hour to reception.
We received a few compliments from our guest at how engaging our DJ was and we couldn't agree more!
We were also pleased with the song selection.
Thank you for a wonderful service.
