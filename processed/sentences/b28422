This is quite an inconspicuous wee bar at the bottom of Howe Street, but it's pretty popular with New Town and Stockbridge locals, and actually surprisingly larger than it looks when you get inside.
The interior of The Standard is smart and plushly furnished, so it's a pretty comfortable place to sit and have a beer, or a nice Sauvignon, or whatever your poison may be.
The bar has a good feel about it, so you can sit for quite a while and banter away without actually feeling you're really in a bar environment (apart from the fact you're glugging down alcohol).
The menu is decent too and inexpensive, so if you're in the mood for proper pub food, like a big helping of burger and chips, or a full breakfast to soak up the hangover, The Standard is a good call.
I am automatically biased against anywhere that blares out sport at high volume levels, but I know half the world love watching a good sports match/game on decent screens, so I would recommend The Standard for such activities, and it gets very, very busy around rugby match season.

The Standard is a little bar half way down Howe Street.
When I walked inside I felt like I'd stepped back in time to the 1950's.
This place is set out like an American diner with photos of Marilyn Munro filling the walls.
The only thing that was missing was milkshakes, girls in the 50's style skirts and roller skates.
I was there on a Saturday night and the place had a good vibe to it - not too quiet without it being packed out!
The drinks were average prices, clientele seemed nice though perhaps a bit posher than I'm normally used to.
Although I didn't eat a meal myself, I did steal some chips from a friend which were pretty damn tasty I must say!
All in all, not a bad spot.
I wouldn't go out of my way to go to this bar especially but if I was in this neck of the woods I'd possibly suggest to go there though it does have some pretty stiff competition!
