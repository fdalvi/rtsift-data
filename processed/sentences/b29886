I ordered and received the most awesome roof wrap for my Mini Cooper S. It was a Tie Dye Peace sign, and Mike and Hannah included a "perf" version for the sunroof area that matched up perfectly.
I emailed and asked about installation and they advised having a pro do it.
I did, and it turned out great!
Although it was only guaranteed for 1 summer, I still have the perf on the roof (it's faded, but still cool), although I had to peal the solid part off last year.
As soon as I take it off, I'm going to plan a new wrap for Aesthetic Creations to design for me.
(FYI, for no cost, they sent me clear vinyl tape to finish off the perforation area, so that it would not peal going through car washes, etc.).
Great products, great service, great after care!

I have used Aesthetic Creations three times for graphics on three different MINI's.
The last time was in August 2011.
I have found Mike to be easy to work with.
Prompt at returning any inquires, creative with designs and to have fair prices.
As these are custom designs I know it might take some time to design.
Every time I have worked with him I have been satisfied will all areas of design, creation and installation.
Always turning out perfect!
All of my communications with Mike were over the phone and via e-mail but he was always prompt and even sent me a mock up of the graphics.
I live in Colorado but will always go to him for any other graphic need I may have.
Great guy and great company.

Ordered a perforated Union Jack for my sunroof.
Fast freindly service, quick shipping and still looks good 3 years later.
Highly recommend this merchant

When I purchase my next car this is where I will take it.
I have seen their work at shows and conventions and it is some of the best I have seen.
One of our neighboring businesses has a Mini parked out front done by this shop a few years ago and it still looks new.
