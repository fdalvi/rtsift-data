Booo!
Very crappy attitude from dude at the counter.
My buddy rented a bike for a week and they quoted him .25 per mile on the phone for going over max.
At the end of the ride he read the contract and they changed it to .50.
The bike was a piece of crap with a bad front end.
He asked for another and they wouldn't give him one.
We had little confidence in the maintenance team when the oil fill cap flew off as we pulled away from the shop.
Stay away.

Very shady business practices.
Will write down one down payment and then demand double.
Sales brags about being wasted.
Never a call back on any information.
Altered sales date to make payment due early.
Never get your plate on time

These guys are a joke!
Got a Harley from them get a great deal I think, but it's been 3 months and still no registration.
I will give them a couple more weeks before I return it for breach of contract.
Corky was cool but the rest are useless and I received so much wrong information I'm shocked they haven't been sued.
If the font get my registration they will.
