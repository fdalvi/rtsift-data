Good service.
We came in for dinner and were greeted and seated immediately.
Our order was taken quickly and drinks promptly brought to us.
The waiter was friendly, polite and attentive.
The chips and salsa were good, comes with 4 salsas.
I liked the spicy and mild (which was still spicy) best, my husband enjoyed the mango.
The last was an avocado salsa, but neither of us eat avocado so we didn't try it.
I got chicken enchiladas in flour tortillas with the red sauce.
They had a lot of flavor.
After I few minutes I remembered I didn't order with no avocado, I hate avocado.
I told the waiter and he rushed to make sure there was none on my plate since our food was almost ready to come out.
My husband had the green chile chicken burrito.
It was large and he said also had a lot of flavor and a good kick to it.
The rice was ok but the black beans were so tasty.
I don't usually eat them, but I ate almost the entire serving.
I would return here and would recommend it to a friend.

A cold beer and tasty tacos at a reasonable price.
The owner/manager was helpful and checked on us several times.
For the money, one of the best meals I had on the trip.

The food was not amazing and we literally spent 30 minutes arguing with the manager about our bill.
The prices are listed differently on the menu, we ordered food from the menu (even pointed at specific drinks) but were surprised when the prices came back as double.
They also added gratuity for 8 people where there were 6... Bad experience.
BUT they have us all a shot of tequila at the end for the huge struggle.
