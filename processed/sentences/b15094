Cindy's is a one room, one woman show where you can expect to receive personalized attention and most of all - time.
She offers all waxing services ranging from $12-$70, as well as facials, microdermabrasions ($125), make-up applications, ($50) and brow and lash tints ($25).
I came in for a brow wax and tint, as well as lash tint.
Cindy was very professional, friendly, and engaging.
The wax she used was gentle on my sensitive skin.
The applications of the tints were done meticulously and the tender skin around my eyes protected well.
In turn, I had none of the product on my skin, and no eye irritation from the lash tint.
I walked out looking like a star.
The treatment room was tastefully decorated, and provided a relaxing atmosphere.
I am looking forward to returning there for further skin care treatments as well as waxing.

If you are looking for ultimate skin care and waxing this is the place!
I received the best microderm ever!
Since then I have been getting my waxing and facial treatments done with Cindy.
She also offers a great mineral makeup line Jane Iredell.
I highly recommend Cindy!

Have had about 20 facials at various places.
Thanks goodness I got this facial with a coupon.
I was very disappointed.
Products were fine but the technique left a lot to be desired.
The message you get with a facial [chest, neck, shoulders and of course...face] was more like a lite rub than a message.
I felt Cindy's fingers but there was no message what-so-ever.
Glad I got to try a new place but, won't go again.
