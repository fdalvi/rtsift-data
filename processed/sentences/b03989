A large and welcoming non-denominational Christian church in Tempe, AZ.
Pastoral staff are excellent and many resources (classes, groups, etc.
) are available to fulfill a wide variety of needs.
When I moved to the area years ago, I tried several area churches but was overwhelmed by the consistent bible-based teaching, and healthy and genuine people who welcomed me in.
As I've grown older, the church has been invaluable in every new season of life.

Lived near this church for a long time.
They should speak to their "flock" and ask them to pay attention to the road when they are coming and going from the church.
Many of them speed and break local traffic laws on Sundays!
Was almost hit by a late attendee last week.

I visited here today and was very pleased with the atmosphere.
I felt very welcomed and pretty much "at home" for the most part.
Being new to the Valley I plan to venture around the valley to visit other churches as well, however I expect to return to Grace Community Church again in the near future.

ok so here's what they teach:  if you are a good person it is right and good for you to take from others and give it to yourself, because you deserve it and everyone else is a bad person.
Stealing is okay, lying is okay, as long as it is done by you, but for the others, they have no place in society, so pillage and destroy them, it is your right and you will be rewarded for that.
Wow.
