This Great Clips has been here ever since I was born, which was '86.
It is the only place I have gotten my haircut ever and I have never had a problem with them messing it up.

I love this Great Clips.
I always call ahead and make sure Annalisa is working.
She does a really good job on my long, thick hair.
First time I came in, I knew I just wanted something new.
Some more volume, some more texture.
She gave me great layers and a style that's easy going.
So lucky I found her.
I've been seeing her for a couple years now.
Everyone else there seems pretty cool, too.
