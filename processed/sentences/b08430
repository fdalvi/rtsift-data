Whoo hoo.
I guess you can guess how I spent my Saturday.
In Chandler you don't really have an option of taking DD online.
You have to actually appear before the judge and plea your case.
As far as DD goes, this one wasn't that bad, for what it was.
Lt. Mike Burns was my instructor and he was very interesting and ran a tight ship.
My class was in the community room at Chandler Fashion Center.
The class started at 7:45 and the air didn't kick in until 8:30 and one wall was on the other side of Paradise Bakery.
And the music in their kitchen was really loud and someone in there was just singin their heart off.
It was distracting and funny at the same time.

This school is terrible!
Don't ever use them, they are incompetent.
I completed my course 11 days ago and they still haven't informed the court.
My license is going to get suspended and now I have a warrant for my arrest.
There's nothing I can do either because the court can't even call them to verify because they never pick up the phone.
If you want to get suspended and thrown in jail, even after you've laid and completed the course, then use this school...lol, then you'll still have to pay the fine, insurance hike and extra points on your license.
Azccts.com is down right criminal organization...and by organization, I mean extremely disorganized.
Please use another school, because this school is terrible and they will screw you over.
