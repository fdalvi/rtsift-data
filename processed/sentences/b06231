Came in for a tire rotation and like that they pointed out a bent rim.
I have been a customer of Discount Tire for many years, and their service has always been great.
The reason I will continue to go back is because they have locations all over the US and we travel all over and it's great to know that if we ever have a problem it's gonna be covered and taken care of at ANY Discount Tire.

I have been coming here for about six years for both my cars.
I shop around and still find that the prices here are generally among the lowest for the type of tires I need.
They are professional and quick for the most part.
When it comes time to replace your tires and you bought the previous set from them, they will credit your new purchase for the leftover tread on your old tires.
I'm not really sure how they figure out how much to credit, but it definitely helps.
The only complaint I have is that they don't have the best selection and even some of the items they do carry takes a while to get to their warehouse.

Came in today..for what I thought would be a tire rotation...front tires well worn on the outside....Tech pointed out front needed to be replaced  I was happy he didn't try to sell me four...at any rate drove out with two new tires..I do like them..got me in/out in less than 40 minutes.....I was pleased..

I wouldn't come back.
All they were focused on was selling me 4 new tires when all I needed was one.
Sorry guys, I've been around the block a few times and know about tires.
