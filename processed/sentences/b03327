Been a loyal customer since they opened ten years ago.
Quality cut and great people.
These are professional barbers who have been doing this for years.
No froo froo!
Russian not spoken there!

I came in for Spring Training and was in dire need of a hair cut.
I didn't want to go to some fancy salon, but also didn't want a quick-cheese "Supercuts" chop (not that all Supercuts cuts are bad, but you're risking getting a less-qualified hack (no pun intended)).
I just wanted a good, basic, high-quality cut.
I happened upon this place while exploring Scottsdale Ave, and the idea of a classic "barber" shop was appealing to me.
Granted, some of those are just old man joints, but thankfully this wasn't.
Very clean and updated, I got this gentleman who was originally from Chicago (I think his name was Sal?
) with many years in the business.
When I told him what I was looking for, he said something to the effect of "I'm going to cut to the shape of your head, and you'll be able to do anything you want with it.
"  I can honestly say that this was undoubtedly the best haircut I've ever had.
He skillfully worked what seemed every hair on my scalp individually (LOL).
Even did the oil treatment & single-blade razor shave.
He had very interesting stories, unlike some of the goofs you'll get in your chains.
My wife was even highly impressed and agreed it was the best cut I've ever had, too.

This place is phenomenal!
Absolutely Love it.
I had the pleasure of letting JD Cut my hair today and he did a superb job.
I won't be going anywhere else.
