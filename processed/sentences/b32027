Sarah did a great job listening to what I wanted and making sure that I was happy with what was being taken off as the cut progressed.
She's also good with the conversation and, like another reviewer said, not overly-talkative.
I went to the Green Bay location a lot when I was in college, and this place had the exact same great atmosphere and quality of cuts.
For only $11 cash ($11.50 credit) you get a cut, wash, shoulder massage, hot towel, some product in your hair (optional), and your own flat screen TV.
I give a 4 out of 5 only because it's not a high-end salon with the best stylists in the nation, that is, there are better places out there.
You'd be hard-pressed to find a better value than here though.

Good place for a guy to get his haircut.
Been there several times with a different stylist each time and while my hair can be most difficult they've all done a good job.
Knock on wood.

I've since changed my mind about going to the Barbershop.
The lady that cut my hair here last really didn't seem to know what she was doing.
I finally just gave up and told her it was fine and left just so I could get into another place to get it fixed before Xmas.
The haircut was ragged, crooked and full of lines.
Think I'll just start going back to JC Pennies even thru its more expensive.
Guess you get what you pay for.

Been here twice so far.
Good haircuts, a warm face towel and quick massage for $11.
Very happy going here and will return every six weeks!
Thank you!

Remember the old Seinfeld show where Jerry is in the car rental agency and is told that they don't have a car for him even though he has a reservation?
He said "It's easy to take a reservation, the key is to keep the reservation" or words to that effect.
He could have been talking about the Barbershop on Junction Road.
I had haircuts their twice before after making phone reservations.
The wait was short and the haircuts were okay - not great but then the price is pretty reasonable.
Today I called and asked for a reservation late afternoon.
I was set up for 5:00 pm.
When I got there I was asked to sign in and sat down with about six other customers waiting for service.
As these customers were called one after another I finally went up to the desk at 5:25 to ask when I'd be served.
Turns out the employee didn't even know where the reservation list was.
They were just working off the signup list when people walked in.
I was told I'd be next after another walk-in was serviced.
They know how to take a reservation, they just ignore it once taken.
I also note that I've never seen an employee twice in any of my three trips.
The place is obviously high turnover with no interest in providing professional service.
I recommend you look elsewhere for a haircut.

Ask for Kelly.
I've been going here for over a year and have just got my last haircut, since I'm moving to another state in a couple of weeks.
The haircut, other services (shampoo, conditioner, shoulder massage, etc.
), and customer service were all amazing.
I have also never had a problem with the reservations when I call ahead of time, but I think this is influenced a bit by the person you make a reservation with.
I have ALWAYS had Kelly cut my hair, since she nailed it the first time and has been able to do the same each time after.
She truly cares about the customer and we've always had a great chat every time I go in.
If only there's a place like this where I'll be moving to!

Courtney is awesome!
She transformed my husband's mid-back length into a short, professional cut, and offered great tips on styling & what to expect in the coming weeks.
She came highly recommended by her coworkers for the job, and I couldn't agree more.
Price is also extremely affordable here.
The haircut & shampoo, beard shaping, eyebrow trim, hot towel treatment and shoulder massage together were less than $17.
If I were a guy (or maybe a lady looking for a masculine cut) this is where I'd go.

I just moved to the Madison area and took a shot on this place.
This was a great experience.
Andre cut my hair.
I asked him to give me the same haircut I've had for 5 years.
He not only delivered but made it even better than I've ever had.
The atmosphere and individual TV for you to watch it really nice and relaxing.
I definitely recommend going here.
It's also only $11.
Such a good deal.

What can you expect for $11?
Usually, not much!
This place is definitely the exception.
I was visiting from out of town and stopped in for a quick trim.
i tried it based on the reviews others have offered here.
The woman who cut my hair was very pleasant, she listened to what I wanted and she gave me a great haircut.
I had to wait about 15 minutes because the place was busy and I didn't have an appointment.
Haircut followed by hot towel, shampoo and shoulder massage.
This is just like Sport Clips offers with the MVP (I did this once) but the haircut was better, the barber more professional and the price tag less.

I have had five haircuts here.
Three of them were good, one was OK and the third was so bad I might as well have put a cereal bowl over my head and cut it myself.
To be fair, they touched it up as quickly and as best they could when I went back the next day.
Overall, the service is friendly, you rarely have to wait too long and the shampoo, hot towel and shoulder massage are nice value-adds for a mere $11.

Get your hair cut by Bre.
She's the most thorough stylist there.

Screw it man, I'll give it a five.
Courtney rocks.
She she tries to give you the best cut she can and isn't just trying to get you in and out of the seat.
She's also great to talk to.

Wow this place totally rocks.
For $11.00 I feel like I am stealing from them.

I have to admit, I didn't have very high expectations coming in.
But I got a great haircut for $11!
The staff are really cool and very experienced (the guy who cut my hair said they don't hire people fresh out of barber school, preferring more experienced employees).
Plus, the little massage and hot towel at the end are a great touch.
I'll definitely be back.
This place is leaps and bounds ahead of the likes of Cost Cutters and Great Clips.

Ambiance is great.
Price is phenomenal.
And the shampoo/massage extras clinch it.
Granted, my hair is easy to cut, but I've never been disappointed -- and I've often been pleasantly surprised.
Tip well here.
They deserve it.

This place is great and the staff is really nice as well!
They do get busy that's why I'm glad they take appointments as well as walk-ins.
Peanuts TV a hot towel on your face and massage plus the haircut all for $11!
To good to be true but is true!
My barber is shana she does amazing!
Everyone else is good as well.
These girls work there buts off though so tip well for your haircut they deserve it.

Shhh - don't tell Ka (from Dick and Arnie's) that I cheated on him.
To be fair, he IS visiting another country right now, so I guess it doesn't count...  + Very easy to schedule an appointment; accommodated me with short notice + Awesome waiting area - huge flatscreen, comfy couches, big table, lots o magazines  + Quick check-in; sign-in and you're ready to rock + Lindsey did a great job interpreting my requests + Cut was over before I knew it, and was well done + Shampoo, hot towel - definitely a surprise (and enjoyable) + Shoulder massage - unexpected, and also pleasant  + Incredibly inexpensive  It is definitely a barbershop, but with some fancier fixins.
I wouldn't hesitate to go again, but I'm loyal to Ka, so until he decides to visit his homeland again, it'll probably be a bit before I return.

I used to go to a similar place with the same services, but it cost more.
Once my preferred stylist left there, I was a "free agent" and tried out The Barbershop - why not???
As far as "bang for your buck" goes, this is the place.
My haircut isn't horribly complex, so paying a bunch for my cut sucks.
The Barbershop does a great job for a great price.
Find a stylist you like and request them next time through (or call head, make an appointment - whatever).
The price is great for the haircut alone, but to get the shampoo, hot towel and a little massage makes it SO worth it.
With the savings each cut, I don't feel like I have to stretch out the time between cuts.

$11 Bucks cash.
What more do I need to say.
This gets you a no appointment/just walk right in haircut, hair wash, hot wet towel on your face & quick shoulder rub.
No complaints here.
This is my go to place once a month.
I've had 4 or 5 different hair stylists now and they all have been equally good.
If you go any time after 4pm your going to have to sit and wait 20 minutes or so most days, so I do not recommend this.
I'm more of a  sneak away from work for 30 minutes at 10am kind of guy.
But if you find yourself waiting to get your cut, they have exceptional leather couches and chairs with unlimited peanuts and coffee to enjoy!
Most of the time they also have a TV at each station set to ESPN or whatever you choice to watch during your quick cut.
If your looking for a fancy style, special haircut or sorts, this may not be your haircut place of choice.
For that reason only I give it a 4 out of 5.
But, fortunately for me, I'm a quick run in---just cut it short type of guy.

This place is convenient if you're on the far west side.
I like that for only $11 you get your hair cut, hot face towel, hair wash, and shoulder massage.
Pretty hard to beat that kind of service for the money.
I like my hair fairly short for a woman and like that they don't try to femme up my short hair like I've had happen at other hair places.
Last time I went I think my hair cutter's name was Lizza and she gave me a nice haircut that did a good job of matching the style of the pictures I brought.
I've gone 2-3 times, been happy with the cut and atmosphere, and plan on visiting again!

Love this place!
I've been coming here for a couple of years and Shana is the best.
I don't ever even consider going anywhere else.
Great prices, exceptional service, comfortable atmosphere.

i dare you  russian roulette for hair  hair too simple to be completely wrecked?
you think so?

Great first visit and haircut.
Stylist listened well and gave me exact cut I asked for.
Price is also great.
