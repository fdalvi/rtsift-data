I had an appointment with her, and less than an hour of my appointment, she calls me and cancels.
She said that it was a family issue, which I could understand.
The bad part about it was that she didn't even apologize!
It's been over two weeks now, and I heard nothing from her.
With customer service like that, you might as well kiss your business goodbye sooner or later if you treat people like that!

I have done my Reiki 1 & 2 with Amy and I can assure you she is one of the best instructors and practitioners in Las Vegas.
She also conducts one of the largest Reiki circles in Las Vegas.

Amy provides heartfelt, intuitive healing with compassion and master skill level.
I find her to be extremely professional and incredibly gifted.
Amy has an authenticity that I search for in a true healer and she looks at the entire picture, - mind, body, soul and spirit - to assist her clients.
I am a Reiki Master myself and have experienced many Reiki sessions over the last 18 years.
Amy is at the top of the game, hands down.
I recommend her highly for those experienced with Reiki and to those who are just opening up to the incredible benefits of this healing modality.
