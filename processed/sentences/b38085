If you can indulge in a 1000+ calorie meal, make it a Five Guys Hamburger & Fries!
Freshly made to order.
Hot and perfect burger.
Yummy fries.
Just did not care for the futuristic coke machine - I was taste testing a few flavors before settling on the original Coke and my drink had an odd flavor to it...even after dumping 2 cups out.
Loads of peanuts to munch on while they make your burger.
Add another 200 calories for that;)

Great food.....
Ridiculous prices.....i cant in my right mind fork over 30.00 for 2 adults to eat at a fast food joint.
Sorry 5 guys.....
I'm out and eating elsewhere ..

The Good:  -People working behind the counter are enthusiastic.
-Tons of extra fries thrown in the bag.
Not overly salted, but could use a little bit more crunch.
-The food isn't bad.
Burger tastes fresh.
The Bad / Meh:  -The music was cranked up way too loud.
Seems like a set of speakers need to be installed in the kitchen so it doesn't have to be cranked up for the workers to hear it.
-The burgers aren't anything to write home about.
The bun tastes like a regular bun you can get anywhere, the meat patty could use some extra seasoning.
The cheese is plain-old American cheese.
-The price.
While the price isn't outrageous, $13 for a burger and fries that aren't really "high end" is a bit much.
(It's regular beef it's nothing special like organic / grass fed / whatever).
The Bottom Line:  I normally don't eat burgers but made an exception for Five Guys due to all the "omgz this is awesome" hype.
It's 3 stars...better than fast food but not something to go out of my way for.
