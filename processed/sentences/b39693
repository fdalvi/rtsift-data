Some actual stuff to buy!

This place is much bigger than one in Glendale.
More vendors nice place.
Enjoyed it with my son especially getting him Pokemon cards for 2 bucks

This place is so-so.
Its got a lot of booths still available so hopefully they'll get them filled and be able to offer more things.
there's a variety of things to choose from tho so thats a plus.
It's typical, nothing really stood out for me so I can't get all excited.
Same stuff you find at any other swap meet.
Didn't find anything that interested me so I can't comment on their pricing.
