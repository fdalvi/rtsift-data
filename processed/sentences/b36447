Good coffee, friendly workers.
Much much better then the previous owners brew.

I work nearby and occassionally stop by here in the mornings to get coffee.
They serve illy coffee which is really good and I had never had it before coming here.
You can get drip coffee, espresso, or specialty drinks.
The service here is pretty fast even though there's only 1 person working on any given morning.
They also have a selection of food items, but the only one I've had is the crossaint sandwich (comes with egg and meat), which was pretty good.
Look out for specials that they run, and take advantage of them while they last because they're usually a pretty good deal.
If you park in the Molasky garage, they will valiadate up to 1 hour with purchase.
This is probably the 3rd coffee shop I've seen at this same location and I'm hoping they'll stick around for good because this one is a lot better.

Their coffee quality has significantly gone down over the past year and now I sometimes don't even finish my drink, even though I usually only get a grande.
I'm not even sure if they serve illy coffee anymore since they just use regular cups now...they probably don't which is why it's no good anymore.
I still find myself coming here because I work next door and it's convenient to just come here versus driving to Starbucks.
They have pretty decent breakfast sandwiches and bagels but that's all I've really had here, so I can't comment on any of the other pastries.
The lady here is nice if you get to know her, otherwise you probably wouldn't agree.
They will also validate your parking if you buy something
