The food here is great but I recently had a slip up but other than that its delicious!
The atmosphere feels like an old hotel from up north  service is OK but needs improvement

The service was okay.
The food menu is limited to a few things.
I felt as if I might as well had stayed home and cooked.
The food was hot and tasty though.
I had my kids with me but it seemed to be mostly for older men who play golf.
