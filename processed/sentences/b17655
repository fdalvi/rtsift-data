Juliet & Angelica are the most organized, nicest wedding planners I've ever met and worked with.
They are so great at communication, which is very important when planning weddings & events!
I have even attended a friend's wedding that Green Orchid Events planned.
It was at a very unique location (Sky Combat Ace airplane hangar).
The decor was so beautiful!
It was hard to believe an entire wedding, food and all, could be pulled off so flawlessly in such a unique location.
Anyone getting married should contact Juliet and have Green Orchid do everything from start to finish for the most memorable event.

Juliet is the BOMB!
I am a pretty organized person but she takes it to an entirely different level.
Juliet thought of details that I would never have and she was able to pull so many thing together that our wedding was seamless and FUN.
If you are looking for a full planning, end-to-end or day of coordination, you cannot find anyone better than Green Orchid.

I hired Juliet Douglas at Green Orchid Events as a "day-of" wedding coordinator.
I planned the wedding myself, which took a year, but Juliet always made herself available to answer any questions I might have and offer referrals and suggestions for local vendors I could use.
Then, she and Angelica had the daunting task of taking all my planning and putting it together to make our day "perfect - the way it was in my head.
" To say the least, they did everything I could have hoped for and more!
Our wedding day was perfect and everything went off without a hitch!
I COULD NOT have done it without Green Orchid Events!
Thank you from the bottom of our hearts!
