Really like this place.
They have always done a great job.
Finally made the switch after Super Cuts was always hit or miss.

This place is amazing they all cut like they been doing it there whole life and the best part about this place is there good prices witch means you can afford to get one every week!!

My son and I stopped in nice cuts today I was very pleased with the service we received are haircuts turned out great Eli was very pleasant and did a great job even trimmed my beard put lotion on my neck and a shoulder massage what more could you want from a haircut place I would recommend them highly good job guys thank you very much Chris Adams
