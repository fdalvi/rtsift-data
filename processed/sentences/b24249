We absolutely love this office.
Dr. Ann has really done an amazing job with our pup.
Dr. Ann's staff is also fantastic!
The office and the rooms are always very clean.
We totally recommend this location!

The place was really nice!!!
Very clean and didn't seem or feel like a vets office.
The staff was exceptional.
They were very polite and helpful both when I entered the office as well when I checked out.
Dr.
Trimmer was exceptional.
I brought my baby a 10 month old Shar Pei to Animal Allergy and Dermatology for his chronic ear infections.
Dr.
Trimmer and I talked about what was going on with my baby and once she took swabs of his ears she decided to put him on an antibiotic regiment as well as put him on a special diet.

Bazil is looking amazing after such a long battle with his allergies.
Although the kindness and the generosity Dr.
Trimmer and her Staff just showed me, I can't even explain in word.
It's a double whammy blessed visit for Bazil and his Mama!!

Dr.
Trimmer has been able to figure out how to cure every skin, ear, and allergy issue my 2 boxers have had.
I don't even bother going to my regular vet first because usually I end up here anyway.
She is detailed, knowledgable, and definitely cares about her patients.
Visits are not cheap, but definitely worth every penny.
She will give you options to work with your budget if needed and will explain all the treatments so you can consider all factors before deciding what to do.
I wish she treated people!
