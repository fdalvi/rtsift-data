slow, very slow.
you would think for what they charge they would move a little faster.
slow, sloowww, sllloooowwww.

I was introduced to Jackson White 2 years ago when I moved my father to Arizona, and needed help getting him into the ALTCS program.
They have been great to work with, and did an excellent job with my father's case.
They have been worth every dime I've paid.
In particular, I appreciate the work that Eric MacDonald did for me, along with his team.
I also had a good experience with Adam Decker, who gave me good advice regarding a real estate matter.
Overall, it's a solid firm, and definitely a good one to consider, particularly for elder-care matters.

I've been really impressed with John Skiba and his professionalism.
He is always up to date on everything in bankruptcy law and I've enjoyed reading his blog posts.
It really shows his expertise and passion for what he does.
Hopefully I will never need his services but if I ever were to need an Arizona bankruptcy attorney I would go to him first for sure.

If I could give them a zero I would, but yelp made me give at least 1 star.
Several unreturned phone calls, several "I'll get back with you"s and never anything.
So disappointing.
Don't waste your time.
