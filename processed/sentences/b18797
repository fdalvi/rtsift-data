I like this clinic and especially Dr. McComb.
We take our shepherd/rott mutt here for her health care.
They have separate entrances for cats and dogs, are open Sat mornings, very attentive during our dog's recent cancer surgery.

In my experience, Dr. McComb and staff are the best vets in the EV.
Really caring, knowledgeable, always remember us and the dogs, and don't try to get you to do all sorts of expensive stuff that your dogs really don't need.
They are really concerned with what's best for the animals.
Also, the separate dogs and cats entrances are really helpful since my Jindo really does not like cats!
I've been to other vets- and one really, really bad one- and the experience here is totally different.
You'll love Dr. McComb.
Highly recommend!
They're at McQueen and Pecos Roads in Chandler.

I would like to actually give five plus!!
I was recommended to this clinic  by a friend and was totally 100 percent impressed.!
Our puppy with an intestinal block was looking close to death.
He picked up things on the xray the other vet did not and explained things to me really well.
EVERYONE in the office was kind, friendly and compassionate.
He re arranged his schedule to save this puppy we love so much and was fair and honest.
In any business, weather it be car fixing, Dr's or vets the number one thing is honesty and integrity ...this guy has it all, with compassion and experience to go with it.
I am so relieved and happy to see our pup eating again and back to his normal silly self!
Would not go anywhere else now:)   They saved my dog :)

On two occasions I had to make emergency appointments for zoe, my Italian Greyhound, they always accommodated getting her in and making sure that after we went home to call and do a follow up.
Dr. McComb is very thorough with exams and presents different options for treatment.
I recommend this clinic to all my friends who have furry friends.
