Terrible.
delivery guy left flowers on ground and walked away.
The flowers were destroyed.
50 to 60 percent of flowers were broken at the bud.

If I could give less than 1 star I would.
This place is ridiculous and why I'll never use anything but a local company from now on.
Thru brought the flowers in a box to my fianc√©es work.
For her to cut the stems and assemble.
Pathetic!
Just 'here's a box of flowers...arrange them yourself!
'  Never again will this company get my business.
I even wrote them a lengthy letter about how appalling their business model is and no reply.
Nothing.
DO                 NOT                   USE                1-800-FLOWERS!!!!!

They missed mothers day and I called and they missed again.
Now I call tog et my money back and they are acting like they are doing me a favor.
Sorry, can't trust a florist who doesn't deliver.
My mother gets flowers for mothers day, plain and simple.
Somewhere there's a florist who wants my business, after years of better service, it seems 1800 is too big for me.
They no longer want my feeble birthday and holiday business.
So they won't get it.
Oh well, that's a grand a year some other company will get.
