convenient for mix.. toiletries.. pharmacy.. they even have a walk in doctor's clinic.. the location across from TI (Treasure island)

this place is awesome, just want to write a quick review.
there pharmacy staff is great.
my son had really bad allergy and one of the techs.
skinny (asian) young gal with long hair walked my down the isle and showed me what i needed.
and got me in and out of the store in a short timely matter.
great service!!

This is an awesome pharmacy always takes great care of me I'm always treated like family the pharmacy staff is very knowledgeable  Thank you very much janice and Samik for all you help
