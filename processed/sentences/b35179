Ok, I am guilty of eating at some nasty fast food restaurants, but this one was amazing!!
I was craving a huge, juicy, greasy, burger and some fries and I will say the burger was in fact HUGE and JUICY, but not greasy at all!
I ordered I think a number 6 and could not finish it.
I will definitely come back here again.
The staff I encountered were friendly and the price was reasonable.
Good Job Carls Jr!!

OMG I love that Super Bacon Cheeseburger.
I will be sorely dissapointed if this discontinues because it's a movie promotion burger or whatever.
I have eaten at various Carls Jr's several times in the last few weeks just to keep ordering this burger.
Might be the best fast food burger out there IMO.

I checked on yelp if Carls Jr was open Thanksgiving & it said yes.
Came to the drive thru and some one told me to look over the menu and let them know when I was ready to order.
I waited... And waited.
They never came back.
Lights were on inside but 10 min later no one came back.
Drove up to the actual window, no one there.
RUDE!!!!
Don't say you will be open if you don't have workers that are going to actually work.

In a span of 10 minutes I watched 4 workers go outside to smoke a cigarette.
I stood inline for 5 minutes while workers chatted in the back doing whatever it is they do when they aren't working.
Thankfully a car went through the drive thru so they had to actually work and saw me, otherwise I would have starved to death.
Actually I would have just left.
Terrible service, feel bad the owner pays these people.
