They get the job done

I love this place.
Cheap, fast, friendly.
Their pizza tastes much better than it used to years ago, and I am absolutely in love with their Italian cheese bread.
Never had a problem here, but it can get busy during their Hot 'n' Ready hours (basically, after 5pm/dinner rush).
Protip: if you DO want Italian cheese bread, call ahead and order unless you want to wait around for 10 minutes.

Just the same as always but this time we got the square pizza!
MMMMM corners!

Customer Service could have been better, didn't ask to 'see ID' as indecated on my bank card, then when I offered for him to check it, 'oh, we don't check unless it is over $25.
' Really?!
Even though its indecating, you still won't check unless it 'over' an X amount?
Another store did check, as requested.
I don't think I will be returning to this store.
Customer Service is alway Number 1 and making the customer feel welcome, regaurdless how busy you are.
Dispite the companies popularity and how fast and ready it is, I dont think I will be Returning here.
Plus the guy ran my card twice, threw the first copy away.
So i will be checking the bank to make sure i wasnt doubled charged.

I don't usually review chains, but $8 hot n ready deep dish pizza is seriously good.
And only $8!
Demand was so high on a Thursday night that they kept running out - the stuff coming out of the oven was literally hot and ready!

Worst service all the time...."Hot and Ready" NEVER!
Always out of any type of "Hot and Ready!
" 25 minute wait always...poor management staff and planning.
7 attempts to get a "Hot and Ready"..........fail....every time....if we have to wait why not sit at home and order a good pizza to be delivered...lost my families business!
