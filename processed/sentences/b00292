I've been going here for many years, Bill the original owner gave great cuts and the new owner Todd does a great job too... You won't be disappointed

Great shop - A fine haircut plus all the positive aspects of old time service and more.
A+ for the Buckeye Barber!
Todd carries on the tradition on Buckeye Rd.
As for the lack of Sat.
hours there must be a shop open in ChiTown that will  do your hair before you come visit cheddarland.
Spare us please!
