There is NOTHING like this in the marketplace.
I love going to outdoor fests, events, and this is awesome!!!
I actually don't have to 'hold it' anymore.
I also LOVE that they give a portion of their proceeds to charity.
In this economy, you don't see that that often.
Now, if we could only have these everywhere I go.
Even restaurants and stores don't have restrooms as nice as this!

MUST USE!!!
Recently, had the option to use Porta Jane at a recent outdoor concert (Extreme Thing) What a difference!!!
Seriously, these port-a-potty's are great.
No Smell, and surprisingly clean inside.
There's even a mirror on the back of the door.
You do have to donate at least a dollar to use, but it's for charity.
Honestly, I was so happy to see the Pink that I gave the guy a $5 and told him to keep it.
It's worth it!!
I would highly recommend anyone having a special event to use these instead.
Even with the donation there was still a line of people waiting to use them.
