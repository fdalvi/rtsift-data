Meh...The person I went with liked the food and he's Asian, so maybe that says something about the place.
I personally didn't like it and I dont think Im that picky.
I say if you have other options take them and leave this for a last resort.

I eat a lot of asian food.
When it comes to thai food, I base it on one main dish....pai thai.
And their wasn't too great.
It tasted like one you would get from a mall food court not from a nice sit down.
And their beef was not very tender.
I love to support local small businesses but sadly, I won't be returning to this one.
Their customer service was excellent though

My husband and I eat Thai food frequently.
We have had Thai food in many different cities, and all over Vegas, but in all our years of experiencing Thai cooking, this has got to be the very worst EVER!
We never thought it was ever possible to have a Thai dish that could taste so horrible.
And this is the first time I felt compelled enough to write a bad review.
I wouldn't want anyone to make the same mistake by giving this place a chance.

The menu print was so small, I would need a magnifying glass, plus the lighting was not helping anything.
The service was polite but not like they anticipated anything, despite my complaining about not being able to read the menu.
We ordered a beef dish which was not what we expected.
It was a flank steak.
The spring rolls were good, but didn[t come with the 3 traditional dipping sauces.
Apparently mustard is off their menu.
It only came with the sweet sauce.
And our pad suwe had mushy noodles.
The whole thing was very disappointing.
