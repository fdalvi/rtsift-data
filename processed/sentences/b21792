We've eaten here a few times, and the food was always good.
However, the last time we ate there, I found a BUG in my food.
When we complained to management, they still thought we should pay for 50% of the meal.
Never eating there again.

Mike C & I dropped in to this nice, fairly large Chinese place for lunch today.
I counted up a generous selection of 74 main food items, including a little sushi.
The Hot & Sour Soup was excellent, there were lots of salad items & fruit, & an array of of tasty hot dishes.
Some of my favorites here were the Egg Foo Young, the fried chicken, & the big shrimp in the vegetable combo dish.
Good place!
Lunch Buffet $7.29, Sr. $6.56

I might be wrong but i think this is the only chinese buffet in Apache Junction and if so they are lucky to get one this good.It was not one of my top chinese buffets but it was a solid 4 stars.I started with a bowl of clam chowder and it was very good .Then i had a couple plates from the main buffet some of the items that stood out were the crispy fish,steamed fish mongolian beef,chicken wings,peanut chicken,honey chicken and stuffed mushrooms were all good.I also had a couple of couple of desert plates which were ok but nothing special.A nice place with good food and a cheap price,Yay i am a fan

Not bad.
Pretty much your average, run of the mill larger Chinese buffet.
They did have a slightly better selection than some places.
The staff was friendly and kept the buffet well stocked and stirred.
The men's room needs some repairs/updates and scrubbed from top to bottom.

Stopped here for lunch with my wife at about 11:30 - food steam trays were cold - asked if there was a problem - was told steam trays were not working right - they would give nothing off the bill even though we ate only a couple of spoonsful.
Should have called the health dept.
Will not eat here again.

Now closed.
