This little place needs help...I think the employees want to please their customers...but service is slow.

Worst place ever!
Don't eat there!
Every time I go, they always forget something!
Worst place ever!!!!!!

Don't get me wrong I love this place but today was enough to make me say no more chances, first order of hot wings were under cooked called back got them replaced and even waited 20min for them to be fresh took them home and guess what, still under cooked, I'm thinking their fry oil isn't hot enough to cook these hot wings throughly.
