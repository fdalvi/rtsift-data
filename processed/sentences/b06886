Worst.
Service.
Ever.
Over the course of three different visits and several phone calls, I was astonished at the poor service we received.
We will be buying everything to build our new house at any location other than Brunsell.

I've gone to Brunsell several times over the years for a wide variety of projects (kitchen remodel, cedar deck).
I've found their staff to be courteous, helpful and possessing  deep knowledge of the product lines they carry.
On a recent order, I was even offered free delivery despite the small size of my mill work order.
You just can't get this kind of service at a big box store.

The specialized, high quality, service they provide at Brunsell is a valued addition to this community.
That being said, however, their service is atrocious and their business could improve measurably with a few very simple improvements.
For instance, why not have a price list available for things like Knit bowls and knobs?
Instead, they require you to go and ask the surly, rude, "why are you bothering me" sales people at the customer service desk.
At the very least, they should rename the desk.
As the owner of an old home in an historic neighborhood, I will continue to come back here, but I know they could probably make my life a lot easier Anselmi many more products than they are, if they took the time to bother to find out my needs.
I will continue to buy salvage antique trims or stock from Home Depot and Menard's, just to avoid having to talk to these people again.
