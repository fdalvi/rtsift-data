Jamie has been doing my nails for awhile now and I am always happy with them.
I can't wait until she starts doing facials!

Loved Jaime and this little salon.
She does great work and is very knowledgeable about nails - why they are or aren't doing well and what you can do about it.
She also does hand painted nail art - not sure there's another word to describe it.
In addition, she is extremely personable and will immediately put you at ease.Plus,  prices are right.
Jaime and this salon (located adjacent to Fringe) will be my manicure go when I am in Phoenix.

Jamie does a wonderful job!
The Salon at Fringe is spectacular and Jamie's Vanity is quite the addition to the salon!
Jamie is very thorough, gentle, artistic and provides genuine authentic personalized services.
Her prices are very fair for the quality of services offered.
I highly recommend Jamie's Vanity to anyone I know and even strangers!
