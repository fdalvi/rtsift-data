After calling first, then driving 40 minutes across town in the late afternoon we were turned away by staff.
1st off, they only had ONE working bowling lane.
out of the 20 there, only 1 worked.
And upon our arrival another couple was using it.
So as the miserable clerk explained to me, our choice was to wait 3 hours for them to finish all 6 games, or hit the road.
They had terrible customer service.
No wonder this place is struggling.
they didnt offer the least bit of courtesy or attempt to make it right.
And who sells a groupon for bowling when there is ony 1 operable lane?
Also whoever said this place was good for kids in the business listing?
really?
it is an old smoke hole that smells like old grease.
only thing in there is old drunks, old slot machines and an old bowling alley.
Don't waste your time.
would be different if the staff gave even the slightest bit of effort.

So this place has pluses and minuses.
It is a bit of a dive bar so be aware of that.
My husband and I had a groupon, three games, shoes and a pitcher of beer for $15.
It's only a few blocks away so we gave it a shot.
We got a lane right away, no one else was bowling at 4pm on a Monday.
We knew a league started at 6:30 so we beat that.
Service was slow for our beer but the alley was nice, well waxed.
After the games we decided to stay for the football game and do some gambling.
It's a good crowd for the game.
We sat at the bar, signed up for the players club.
Draft beers were a buck and they had prize drawings every quarter.
We one some sunglasses and beer cozies.
The manager was very friendly and attentive.
Food was cheap and decent.
This is a small, smokey place with mostly locals.
On the plus side the bowling, food and beer was cheap.
On the minus the service was a bit slow once the game ended and the machines are all hand pay, no ticket.
People were friendly though and we had a nice time.
Since they have special prices for gaming professionals and women we'll probably go back.
