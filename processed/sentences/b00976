It's a big health food store.
Really big.
So big that they have walls full of things that I didn't know could fill walls: Almost infinite varieties of vitamins, protein shakes, extracts, tinctures, you name it.
They probably have several different choices for just about any exotic elixir you could possibly need.
Or want.
And, they have a loyalty program that allows you to buy the second of whatever at half-price, even on a later visit (within 60 days).
Their sales are usually pretty good.
Some items are on sale but not on the flyer, so it's good to ask the clerk.
The people here know their stuff well, and spend more than enough time with every customer.
Even the wacky ones.

Quick stop to pick up some protein powder... and as I browsed their shelves, I found myself with questions.
I was approached by someone very knowledgeable about the majority of the products offered.
She did not try to "push" anything on me but with her additional info made me feel good about my purchases.

This is the best place I have ever been to stock up on protein and energy drinks.
Alex, the manager is always super helpful along with ALL the staff.
I have never had a bad customer service experience.
I went there at least once a week since they opened and now once a month now that I live in Chicago.
Great selection, highly knowledgable staff.

I was on the hunt for Argan Oil (great for hair and skin) and I initially went to Trader Joe's next door.
The woman there said to try Hi Health and so I did even though I never go here.
I asked one of the female employees there if they had Argan Oil and she said they did not.
She didn't even look around first or ask anyone...As I was about to walk away one of her male coworkers spoke up and said he did think they carried Argan Oil.
After searching for a minute he found it for me!!
I left a happy customer.
