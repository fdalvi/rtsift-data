Best place to get a watch battery changed, have your jewelry repaired or buy second hand beautiful and unique jewelry.
Don't be fooled by the other jewelers who want to charge you more money if you own a Movado or other high end watch, the competitor's  18-25 dollar batteries don't last any longer  and DO NOT affect the timing!
Many Rolex owners discovered this gem of a place.
They also have the add a pearl necklaces with the pearls sold separately.
Nancy is a struggling business woman who has a kind heart!
Don't be dismayed by the lack of fancy furniture in the shop, the work is quality.

Great service to have a watch band sized!
They fixed it while I waited.
Very pleasant to work with.

Great little jewelry store in the Pavillions shopping center.
Owner is very personable and does very nice work.
Very reasonable price to re-size watchband.

this place was great.
but they are now closed.

I have been going here for over 15 years.
I've consigned a wedding ring (got top dollar), bought new his/hers wedding bands (wholesale prices), silver chains, replaced watch batteries, you name it!
All with reasonable and honest prices.
I wouldn't trust anyone else.
Not always timely and the store is just a-ok inside, but it is all very worth it and I couldn't speak more highly.
