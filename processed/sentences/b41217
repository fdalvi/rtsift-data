Mom in town.
Needed a ride.
Reservation number given with printed confirmation and credit card charge made Saturday night.
Monday morning, called number -  answering service" - no one heard of her reservation.
No ability for "answering service" to correct this error.
If a guaranteed ride is needed in this instance it was not provided.

There really isn't much to say here.
This is a budget SuperShuttle.
Their vans aren't as new and shiny, but the A/C works and the drivers are friendly.
And you save 10% compared to SuperShuttle.
What more could you want?
I paid for a round-trip, so when we returned all I had to do was call the dispatch number and let them know we were at baggage claim.
They directed us outside, and a few minutes later a van showed up.
Easy peasy.

Okay, I was ready to cancel my reservation with Arizona Southwest Shuttle because the customer service over the phone is absolutely horrible!!
BUT, JJ the driver ended up being so prompt, friendly, and pleasant it made up for the unorganized customer service.
He's the nicest guy!
Whoever answers the phones is rude, unorganized and very unfriendly.
After speaking with him, you feel very uneasy about the reliability of the company.
Ended up being very reliable.
Maybe they should work on customer service.
They would be 5 stars
