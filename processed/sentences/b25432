I would not waste your time if you have other options.
There's just not a big selection.
The parking lot was crowded but in the store it wasn't.
Friendly staff.
No ugly Christmas sweaters, they did try to sell ones for $19.99 that were homemade, capitalizing in the trend.
I agree that things are overpriced!!
I found some cute juice glasses for $0.69 that's it!

Always keep in mind that "thrifting" isn't the same as retail shopping.
If you want nice n fancy, don't thrift.
You wanna find a good deal or two, then go here.
As thrift stores go, this one is well organized.
Staff was willing to help.
Prices were reasonable.
I've been to other Goodwill stores who's prices were higher.
I needed something to wear to a party and I walked out with two $10 dresses.
Two dresses for $20?!
I'm happy with that!
My only complaint is that the bathroom needed attention.
I'll be back here again!
