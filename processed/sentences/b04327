This review is similar to, but not quite the same as, the review I wrote for Medical Neurology.
Medical Neurology is the name of the practice of Epstein, Bliklen, and.. some other people.
Kumar?
Hussein?
I've only seen Epstein.
The practice seems pretty busy; I'm surprised no one else has reviewed it.
Anyhow, I've had migraines since I was 12, and have seen half a dozen neurologists across the country.
Dr. Epstein is the best, and my favorite.
He honestly cares about his patients... but sometimes he shows it in nontraditional ways.
I'm giving Dr. Epstein a good review because he helped me fix my migraine drug regimen.
That didn't just involve throwing drugs at me: I also had to figure out which foods and triggered my headaches, and fix my sleep patterns.
Initially, I wasn't thrilled with his action plan.
It certainly wasn't an instant cure, but I feel better than ever, and I'm not overmedicated.
The reviews on various sites that complain about his 'bedside manner' make me laugh.
Yes, he's abrupt.
His sense of humor's a little off.
He thinks up some pretty bad jokes sometimes, so if you get offended super easily, or if you can't deal with political incorrectness... this might not be the neurologist for you.
There are plenty of doctors who will listen to you whine, throw you some painkillers, and coo, 'come back in a month.
' Dr. Epstein will be the one to tell you, 'don't be a moron.
You can't sleep five hours a night, drink a liter of soda a day, eat all your trigger foods, and not get migraines.
' He'll tell you what you need to do to take care of the problem you have, even if it means you might want to shoot the messenger.
If you want to feel better, Epstein & Medical Neurology get my endorsement.
If you want a yes-man neurologist who will just take your money, give you some pills, and kiss your ass so you can avoid any hard answers and  hurt feelings, go elsewhere.

If I could give zero stars for this practice, I would.
I've seen Dr. Epstein twice.
The first time I saw him my primary care made an appointment for me to be seen right away since my MRI showed lesions on my brain.
Dr. Epstein himself seems to be a funny guy with a very dry sense of humor.
I can see how someone can get easily offended though by his jokes.
That first appointment, he looked over my MRI records I brought in and suggested I get a spinal tap to get a diagnosis; thinking its probably multiple sclerosis.
So I had my spinal tap and a week later I was scheduled an appointment to get my results.
When I went to my appointment (paid the copay), I waited an hour to see him just so can ask me if I had my spinal tap done.
I told him yes, that my appointment was for the results.
Do they not communicate?
So, I basically wasted my time and money going to the appointment just so they can tell me they don't have the results yet.
They should have called me at home to reschedule.
They said they would give me a call within the next week.
Almost a month later, I still haven't heard from them again.
I've left countless messages with his assistant, Angela, with no return phone call, saying they have my results or don't.
It's a shame the office is horrible since Dr. Epstein is very knowledgeable.
Go somewhere else if you need help, or expect to communicate with anyone.
This is the worst office ever, don't waste your time if you want answers.

Doctor Michael Epstein was the Neurologist I was referred to by my family physician of over 15 years so I already felt positive about him.
He has been all that I expected and more.
I have the respect for him based on his knowledge and experience and I truly enjoy his comforting personality.
A light hearted sense of humor goes a long way to ease ones fears with serious health conditions Thank you Dr Epstein you are highly recommended in my book!
