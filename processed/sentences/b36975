Yeah, yeah, yeah... CRR (chain-restaurant-review).
Coffee Bean is the newest coffee shop addition to the Fashion Show Mall.
They're located in a semi-permanent structure that they share with Auntie Anne's pretzels right in front of the runway.
They opened up a few weeks ago and I think they'll give Starbucks a run for their money.
The coffee tastes better, service friendlier, and lines quicker.
Plus, mall employees get 50% off everything Mon-Thurs.
20% rest of the week!
You mean I can get a large latte for under $3?
Amazing!
I met the owner of this particular location in the beginning and he was pretty darn friendly--thanking people for choosing them over Starbucks and taking the time to spread the CBTL love with a few customers.
Only thing, sometimes the foam comes out a little too frothy (like soap suds).
But I'll excuse it for a little while while the new baristas kick the learning curve.

WOAH, my god, do not get any of the pastries.
I had a coffee cake, then changed it for a brownie because it was stale, and they were both !
omg, it was like it was in a plastic ziplock for a year kinda plastic taste.
blegh.

Finally got to sample this place before leaving Vegas!
They seem like an awesome coffee chain, I had the dark chocolate espresso based drink, it was better than a frappuccino.
Wish they were in NY!
