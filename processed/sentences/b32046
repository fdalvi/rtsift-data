I'm a recent first time home owner and was looking for someone NOT NAMED Best Buy to come and help me with some home theater setup in my new home.
I heard about Infinity HD through a promotion called "Our Town".
I called and scheduled a time for them to come and install my HD TV.
Justin and crew showed up directly on-time and where friendly and courteous when installing the setup and boy does it look great!
I would highly recommend Infinity HD to all my friends for any of their home theater setup needs.

AMAZING!
Justin Came with his guy and WOW!
The TV was done so nicely, no wires and it looks fab!!
Highly recommend him to all my peeps...

I needed my heavy duty PA speakers hung from the ceiling and the wires hidden in the wall.
Justin came to my house and did all the work in a short amount of time.
I was so happy with his professionalism and his punctuality that I have since referred him to my brother as well as having him mount TV's from the ceiling and wall in my office and he also help me resolve some IT problems I was having.
A++ on the customer service level.

Called yesterday and set up a consultation/quote for 5pm today.
I left work early to get home.
No one came.
I thought maybe I forgot to leave my specific house number when I left my address.
I called in to make sure they had my correct info, and I found out that they scheduled over my appointment.
I should've known that the house number wasn't an issue because I left my number in case they needed to contact me.
Being a few minutes late is no big deal, but a no show is a big inconvenience.
Guess I'm going to find someone else to do the work.
