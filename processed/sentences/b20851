The Colinton Inn is a pleasant traditional village pub with a well kept beer garden, it's perfectly situated for a having a quiet drink after a bike ride along the Water of Leith.
The staff are friendly and professional, I'm always greeted with a smile and they're usually up for a chat and a bit of banter.
Although the bar is not particularly well stocked, it's got most bases covered and it has a good selection of whisky, however I think it would benefit from a larger choice of lagers and real ales.
The atmosphere is best described as quiet, friendly and local.
I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to come here, but it's a decent enough wee pub.

From the outside this little pub looks like the stereotypical local, but that is far from the truth.
I took a walk along here one sunny Sunday after my other half, always on the lookout for craft beer bars for me, found that the Colinton Inn had started selling bottles of craft beer.
Doing so in a very humorous way, Colinton Inn have dubbed themselves the "heart of craft beer within Colinton".
The Colinton Inn being 1 of 2 pubs in Colinton, I found this funny and thought that I should pop along.
Upon entering I noticed that this local had had some serious work done to it as well as keeping the old school feel about the place.
A few TV's were dotted about, showing whatever sporting events happened to be on.
A half decent selection of beers.
Flying Scotsman, McEwan's Red on tap and beers like Iron Maiden's Trooper, Hobgoblin, Punk IPA and Innis & Gunn plus a few more in bottles were all available at a very reasonable price.
1 pint of Strongbow and 1 pint of Flying Scotsman came to Â£6.70 which I was very pleased with.
Full bar is also available.
Live music and other random events are also hosted.
Worth a visit.
