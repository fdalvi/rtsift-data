Being yet another wrap sandwich / smoothie house for the semi-health conscious, Froots brings a small sense of pride and class to an already over infiltrated market.
Glancing at the menu, they seem to have a decent take on whats for lunch.
There are plenty of sandwiches and wraps to choose from, and they all seem to be made with care.
The wraps are also served on actual glass plates, presented in a gourmet-like manner, split in two with a small flourish of sauce on the side.
The smoothies aren't bad either.
A sandwich / smoothie combo (a familiar package seen in nearly any smoothie shop) will run you about $8.50.
That is a couple bucks less than its second rate competitor 'Tropical Smoothie' and way ahead in quality.
For what Vegas has to offer the smoothie market (which isn't much) I would recommend a visit, especially from the competition, who could take a few notes from these guys if they plan on staying in business.

If you're looking for a healthy meal, this is definitely the place.
The wraps are good, but a little on the small side.
The combo deal is not bad, for $2 more dollars you can add a small smoothie.

Apparently this Froots has closed.
There are no lights on when I go by, and the location is not listed on the company's website.
