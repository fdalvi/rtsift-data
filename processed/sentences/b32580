I have been going to ASU Poly for 2 years now, I like the small campus feel, but not a lot of amenities available yet.
They are building an awesome fitness center, but alas, I will be gone before its completion.
The staff actually care about the students for the most part, and are willing to work with you!

It's a good option for college for some people.
Offers all the academic options/support of the ASU system in a smaller campus that's easy to access if you live in the East Valley.
It's a vibe similar to what I'd think a small liberal arts college would have.
There are an increasing number of amenities including brand new dorms, dining and fitness center on campus.
The area itself is growing and essentially safe but boring suburbs.
If you want to hit Mill Avenue frequently or want to be close to college sporting events go to Tempe.
If you want smaller classes and a more intimate college setting where your professors will all know your name Polytech is a good option.
