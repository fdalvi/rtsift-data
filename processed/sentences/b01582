Going to any Aveda store for your supply of Shampure isnt just a shopping experience..its a TOTAL experience.. your greeted with a healthy, smiling staff member.. your offered mint tea... you get a free massage..
YES..
I could fall asleep.. You choose your aromatherapy based on what your nose likes.. and the knowlegable member will work with your skin and hair to get your product correct..
This is no in and out experience..Im sure if you just advised that you need it fast.. and knew what you wanted... they would happily oblige..
BUT just take a moment.. and smell the aromatherapy for olfactory sakes..

When a product has a 100% satisfaction guarantee listed, and your daughter paid $24.00 for .7 oz (20 g) you shouldn't feel guilty when the product is damaged and you return it for an even exchange.
I rec'd Pure Abundance powder as a gift (at Christmas), it was a solid lump of goo when it should be powder.
I was told by the employee it could still be used.
Really?!
No, this product you sprinkle on your hair, not try to spread a blob of goo!
They reluctantly exchanged it, but the one gal looked at me as though I had purposely damaged the product or was pulling a fast one.
I gave them two stars, ONLY because they did exchange the product -- I guess that is what the 100% satisfaction guarantee means, but usually without the attitude.
I will not purchase anything from this Paradise Valley mall Aveda site - the Aveda shop in Tempe is much nicer "Mood Swings" I recommend you go there for your Aveda needs.
Not happy in Scottsdale.

Very rude manager.
She acted like I was an idiot with every question I had.
She acted like it was such a hassle to give me a sample after I spend $50.00.
I will not return.

Best place ever!
The product is amazing and the is friendly, knowledgable, and made me feel welcome.
