As a lazy student, Come Dine With Me is an important part of my daily routine.
So a small group of my fellow lazy student friends got together and made our own Come Dine With Me competition.
One member of the group, who is quite ditsy and clearly richer than the rest of us, used I Eat Naked for her meal.
If you are aware of the concept of Come Dine With Me, you will know this defeats the purpose.
But she was a little dumb and immediately told us she had ordered the food where as I would have been sly and passed it off as my own.
She probably would have won if she hadn't admitted to us she hadn't cooked because the food was that good.
I love the concept of I Eat Naked, with the double meaning in the name as all the food is free from additives and completely natural.
I learned this after checking up on the website after our dinner party.
The meat eaters at the party had steak which was cooked to perfection and the chips... oh the chips!
They were carbohydrate goodness, fluffy and crispy at the same time.
The veggie had a vegetable and goats cheese dish which she polished off with delight.
The great thing about this place was the fact it was a takeaway serving top quality, fresh food as opposed to greasy, unexciting food.
Great for a posh night in, and works well for a dinner party!
Unfortunately I live just outside the delivery zone as they only deliver in the city center in order to ensure the food is still hot and fresh when they deliver.

Really poor atiitude!
Phoned asking for a delivery to be told Polwarth was outwith their delivery zone unless I spend Â£30.
Clearly they dont need customers in a recession!!
Last time I will be calling them!
The guy who took the call was not what you would call friendly either!
