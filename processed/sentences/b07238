Went there on Saturday from 10am to 4pm, not very crowded so the rides and Sponge Bob Square Pants lines were not long.
They had some great FREE entertainment as well.
Had a great time!

The Maricopa County Fair is an unadulterated money pit.
Everything costs a few bucks including parking, entrance, food, and rides.
Just about all of the food is fried, and there seems to be some sort of contest among fairs as to which fair has the most unusual fried food.
The rides are a few bucks a person.
A few bucks times a family is a lot of bucks, just to ride the Ferris Wheel.
You can get a wrist band, but that's only good for one person.
The shows are free, and the kids seem to enjoy them.
There was also an exhibition hall with photography and art contests winners, vendors, and scientific presentations from local schools.
One poster tried to convince me that the same gun could be presented in a manner that looked more dangerous or less dangerous, which I believe was meant to convince me that guns weren't dangerous, but just reminded me that I live in Maricopa County.
My favorite part was getting the shirt.
For some reason, I really liked the shirt.

I'm beginning to realize how spoiled I was in California.
Orange County Fair and Los Angeles Fair blows this out of the water.
They do have the typical fair food but not as much selection as I would like.
I think we came to late and the vendors were all closed.
The rides and games were fun.. prepare to spend money though everything costs at least a buck-$5
