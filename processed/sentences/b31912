In the recently renovated Tropicana, this was a quick choice that seemed affordable.
But, the caesar salad looked like it was from Wendy's and my pizza slice was decent but cost $7....for a slice.

Located inside Topicana, the South Beach Marketplace is the fastfood place to go if you're ever staying at the hotel.
The food of course is cheaper compared to the joints on the strip, but a little pricier.
Though the food does seem healthier compared to your usual hubbub of fastfood chains in the food courts on the strip.
The pizza is good.
So, if you're ever staying in this hotel and you'd like to save money but feel full, then this place is pretty fair.

Not sure why the other reviewers call this place fast food.
It was neither fast, nor fast food quality.
The food was pretty good.
The breakfast sandwiches (served all day) were great.
The pizza wasn't as good as what you'd find at New York, New York, but they still weren't bad.
$7, they say?
Nope.
It was $4 for a slice of cheese pizza.
And these slices are huge.
Yes, it is pricey, but everything in Vegas is pricey.
Compared to other restaurants of similar quality, the prices were average, if not a bit lower than average.
This place is opened 24/7, which is a huge plus, as there isn't much on this end of the strip that is opened late.
Another plus is the gelato/frozen yogurt bar that is housed with the deli/diner/pizzaria.
The gelato was very good, though again, a bit pricey.
They give a 10% off coupon at the register that is good for your entire stay, so it makes a medium (which looks like a small to me) about $6.50, including tax.
Their frozen yogurt is "pay by the ounce," but it is about a nickel an ounce less expensive than a similar shop at the Mirage.
