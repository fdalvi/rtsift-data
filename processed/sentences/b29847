Employer of choice!!!
USAA is consistently rated a top employer in Phx, as well as the nation.
Fortune 20 company!

Companies should sit down and listen to their customer service lines all day to see how over-the-phone customer service should be.
I always have a knowledgeable and friendly representative help me out.
Quite simply the gold standard of banking and insurance in my book.

This bank gives me faith in banking.
I have had terrible experinces with *other* financial institutions.
I am so grateful that in serving one is able to join the USAA family.
I have never had one problem, complaint, nor issue with them at all.
It's like being in a very exclusive club, without the fanfare.
Thank you USAA!!

Amazing company to do business with in every regard.
They stand behind their values.
They CARE about their members and they demonstrate that daily!
I just because an employee for USAA and may I just say...WOW!!!!
Happies person in the world!!!

What can I say?
After 50 years of being ripped off and lied to by banks and insurance companies , I find I'm qualified to become a member of USAA.
I feel like I need to protect "My" bank!
We are A bunch of people who LOVE our servicing insurance and banking Co. And it's an HONOR to deal with fellow veterans who understand how hard life can be, and how important it is to join together and look out for the better good of all.
I had AX for many years, but USAA service is better, and they hire returning vets.
Great Place to put your money and trust.

When I was younger, I had such a hard time with banks!
When I finally signed up for USAA, they actually took the time to educate me about my finances.
Funnily enough, what turned me onto USAA was a car accident.
At the time, I was with another company, and the person who hit me had USAA.
They treated me better, educated me, defended me... which was way more then my company had done for me.
Thanks USAA for being there for me through all of the bumps in the road!
