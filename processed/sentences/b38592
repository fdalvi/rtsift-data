I purchased a groupon for eyebrow threading for this place and I am so happy I did!
This is a great clean place & the people are super friendly!
$8 for eyebrow threading is a decent price, most places have higher prices.
In NJ I use to get my eyebrows threaded for $3-$4 but I have not been able to find a place that does it that cheap in AZ, so far this business is the best I have found here!

Eyebrows and lip for 13?!
Can't beat that!!
I had been driving all the way from the west side to Arrowhead mall to get my eyebrows and lip done, now I save gas and money going here.
Might I add, I am very picky about my eyebrows so I won't review lightly in this subject.
Every time I have gone, the same girl is there, and she is awesome!!
No complaints about this place, always happy with services : )

Worse threading job I've ever gotten.
I explicitly asked for "cleanup" and not to go too thin.
Not only did I get very thin brows, one eyebrow is incredibly choppy & will now have to fill in my brows.
I would have been better off plucking.
