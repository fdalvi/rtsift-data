I visited Phoenix for the first time this past Halloween to attend a friend's weeding at Aldea and now I'm wishing I could get married there!
Granted the bride's vision probably added to the experience as well as the perfect weather, but even so, I thought this place was lovely.
Aldea reminded me of a Mexican hacienda.
The ceremony was held in the courtyard, where the bride and bridesmaids were able to enter via a balcony walkway and down a staircase for a grand entrance.
Hors d'oeuvres were served in another courtyard while a mariachi band played.
The reception was held inside, in a smallish banquet room with a dance floor and lovely arches.
The wedding was an old-style Spanish/Mexican theme and Aldea was the perfect setting.
The walkways lined with lanterns and the courtyard decked out in white christmas tree lights were perfect.
I loved how it accommodated both inside and outside events.

Came here for a friends wedding.
It's like old world Mexico.
Very quaint and nice.
It is a bit dated.
Some floors are caving a bit.
But...
If you are hosting an event they have lots of outdoor space.
It is not expensive, service is ok.
Personally...
There are much better venues.
But for those with a tight budget but want something clean and nice.
Go for it.

What a most beautiful venue.
It was a subtly lit, well stocked open bar, patio, catered wedding and from what I hear all inclusive.
That's nice way to keep track of all those bucks your spending on your big day.
There was a great patio out back and a spacious dance floor inside.
The enire guest list was doing the wobble.
Good times, good times.
I did hear it costs 15K though.
