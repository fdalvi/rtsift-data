This gym is great!
The workouts are never boring and are very challenging!
Great small group atmosphere with workouts for all fitness levels!

Chuck is the real deal.
There isn't anything he doesn't know and you never do the same workout twice.
As an aging Boomer, this is one of the most important things I do for my health.

I love Fitness 5 as much as I love the people I meet there and work out with!
Having a motivational group to work out with keeps me going!
Chuck has taken the time to modify my workouts so that I can continue a healthy workout plan through pregnancy!
I'm very lucky to have found this place!

Came here with my sister in law.
Loved the work outs.
Chuck is amazing and really knows how to communicate what you need to do, to get healthy.
I would love to continue going there but it's too far from where I am now.
