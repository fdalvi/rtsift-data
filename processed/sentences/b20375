A nice place to have a quiet pint after work...a nightmare trying to get one when the rugby is playing down the road (as with all pubs and hotels in the area!
) however the staff are welcoming and it's a place you can relax and enjoy.

I spent 2 weeks in the UK and stayed at 4 different hotels/B&Bs and this was by far my favorite.
Unfortunately, I only stayed for one night but I would love to have enjoyed the house longer.
Our room was upgraded and was absolutely beautiful with a four-poster bed and lovely furnishings.
The bathroom was immaculate, warm, and had a perfect shower.
The rooms feel very fresh and new.
One of the few places I have ever stayed that actually looks better than the professional photos from the hotel website.
The staff were all friendly and accommodating.
I did not have a chance to dine, but grabbed a night cap, wonderful red wine, at the bar.
It was so cozy and comfortable.
I cannot recommend this place enough.
Things to note: A bit of a walk to New Town area but not too far.
Careful not to mix up with the The Dunstane City Hotel...it is right across the street and cab drivers can get confused dropping off & picking up.
