Everytime I visit there I wait at least 45 minutes before I make it through the waiting room door.
Dr. Arnold has removed cancer from me twice.
This last time I waited for 90 minutes and never made it through the door.
Three other people who were there before me were still waiting.
He gets high marks in skill.
His office staff rates a zero for overbooking and rudeness.
His bedside manner could use improving but his skill level outweighs that.
His skill level does not excuse the length of time waiting.
Doctor you are Fired!

First visit I saw the Doctor in 30 minutes.
The second visit was about an hour.
Staff was friendly and knowledgeable.
All questions I had were answered.

Dr Arnold is a no-nonsense professional.
His staff are always friendly and courteous.
I would highly recommend him.
