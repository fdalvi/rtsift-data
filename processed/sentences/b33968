The pizza was good but the wait time for a walk in special was pretty long.
I ordered two pizzas and they put the extra sauce I asked for on the wrong pizza which was kind of disappointing after that wait.
In their defense they were very busy.
I'll go back again though and give them another try.
If I could I would give 3.5 stars to this review instead of 4.

Best pizza for the price.
If you go around lunch time its very busy but your guaranteed a fresh slice.
If you go any other time of the day I suggest you order a personal pizza or a calzone and you will be very pleased.

This is how a local pizza shop should run a business.
There's no doubt they're busy, which is why at times your order can be a little bit slow.
They're busy because they're delicious and a very fair price.
I've ordered pickup, delivery and by the slice and was never disappointed.
The ingredients have always seem to be really fresh, which is why I think their pizza has so much flavour.
My only suggestion to the owners would be to fix their JustEat.ca menu items.
I'm a big fan of ordering online, and that's where I originally found this place but was unable to choose the toppings on my pizza while ordering online.
I picked up the phone and called, and so glad I did.
