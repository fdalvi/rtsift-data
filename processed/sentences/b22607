a tasty pasty, ideal grab-n'-go grub  in edinburgh's pleasantly manageable airport.
then again, the oversized VW surf van and comfortable seating area beckon you to stay and while away the time before, between or after your flights.

It's a long way to go for a pasty I know but the West Cornwall Pasty Co serve the best pasties in town!
Located on the first floor of Edinburgh Airport in the Landside Food Court, the company run their Edinburgh outlet from a large converted camper van with a coffee machine, oven and fridge freezer.
Handmade by bakers, they're cooked to golden brown and come in a variety of mouthwatering flavours from steak & ale and chicken & mushroom to pork & apple and cheese & bacon.
Whilst I appreciate the gourmet flavours, I have to admit I usually settle for a traditional pasty and cup of sugary tea.
Pasty virgins should note: it's easy to burn your mouth with the filling.
Be careful as you take your first few bites or live to regret it.

I have exceptionally fond memories of late-night visits to Edinburgh Airport not long ago, which I'll witter on about in my review of the airport itself.
Having done several all-nighters there, stuck playing mini-golf and the awful Big Buck Hunter at the arcades, the 5am opening of this van / cafe / takeaway would often be a welcome distraction.
The prices will raise more than an eyebrow, but when you've had sod all to eat for 5 hours, their Cumberland sausage and bacon breakfast roll provides what can only be described as pure satisfaction.
With the chain oddly absent from Edinburgh Waverley Station, it's the only place on the East Coast to enjoy this treat, as far as I know.
