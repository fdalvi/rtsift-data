If I could give zero stars I would.
This restaurant is by far the least efficient fast food restaurant in the area.
Unfortunately for me my fiance loves their burgers.
Spent 15 minutes in their drive thru last night with only ONE car in front of me (who had already ordered and was sitting at the window when we got there) before leaving without any food.
This place sucks, everytime we come here they are slow but this was beyond understandable.

My son and I stopped in for lunch.
We had a BOGO coupon for Whoppers.
Cashier was friendly and efficient.
We sat down with our food and both of us were happily surprised at how good the whopper tasted.
I mean come on, it's a whopper.
It was so good that we are going back again very soon, and I am telling all my friends about this place.
Also the restrooms were nice and clean!

Phone number goes to a fax machine!!!!
And they don't post their hours...big pet peeve.
