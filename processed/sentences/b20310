This is definitely a pub for the locals.
I came here after a Six Nations rugby match at Murrayfield and, whilst the drinks are reasonably priced and the atmosphere is friendly enough, there just isn't anything really unique about it.
There is a plasma screen which shows the latest sporting events  anad there is plenty of comfortable seating to relax with a drink on.
I didn't see any food menu, but they do sell crispsand peanuts behind the bar.
Then again, where doesn't?
The decor is nice inside and the staff are friendly.
Whilst this isn't exclusively a pub for locals, there isn't much to draw you here from out of your way.

I have to agree more or less with Gibson.
Roseburn bar does seem to be a pub for the locals.
There was nothing particuarly appealing about it.
I have to say though that I didn't find it friendly.
No one was exceptionally rude or anything, I just didn't feel that welcome.
Yes the beer was quite cheap and yes they have a big plasma screen, but these really aren't anything special.
The pub is quite larg and spacious but I didn't particuarly like the decor, it felt a bit cold and sanitary.
Ironic because the place had a funny smell.
Not the best pub in the world.
Maybe it just has bad days.
Certainly room for improvement.

I agree with the prior two reviews.
I'm a local and desperately wanted the Roseburn to be 'my' pub, but although the ale is adequate and the link with sport obvious, there is a feeling that you're not quite welcome...the staff just cannot crack a smile or add a friendly "hello".
A real shame.
