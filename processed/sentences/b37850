Wow I was disappointed here for some reason.
I love popeyes chicken and decided to order the chicken wrap that has rice and beans inside, a side of cole slaw and of course the sweet tea.
The sweet tea was definitely not as sweet and yummy as it used to be and the chicken wrap was very very small (comparable to the mini breakfast burrito you'd get a McDonalds).
The wrap was hot but it was just eh on taste.
The cole slaw I didn't like at all.
I felt that for almost $5 I didn't get my money's worth including the quality.
I will give them credit for how clean the place was and she was very nice behind the counter.
However if this was my first visit, I would not return.
I am not discouraged though, I will try them again.
I will just order something different.

Mediocre.
The spicy chicken simply isn't.
It's normal, nothing to write (Yelp) about.
Soft drink size inadequate and typically over-priced.
The pricing is not cheap but a little more than it should be.
For only two, it was $24.61.
But today, after I spoke to the person at the initial drive thru and ordered at 6:04 pm, I pulled up, paid, and then she says, "It'll be 5 minutes.
" Hmm, okay, no stock on hand during the dinner hour.
Definitely not fast.
Could you have informed me as I first ordered?

Took my best friend here (both of us are pregnant) & it's not the Popeyes we know !
The spicy wasn't spicy at all & everything was cold !
