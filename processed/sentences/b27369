George is fun to work with.
I had several issues with my home and building project that seemed insurmountable.
His knowledge and proffesionalism were a welcome relief.
He was prompt efficient, knowledgable and a spectacular value.
I appreciate the little extras that come with good solid service, and a sense of humor.
I reccomend this business to anyone who wants real value, and a great finished project.

I have called on George to help with pool equipment repairs for the past 15 years.
He is professional, competent, trustworthy and dependable.
When we moved to a new house and were having winter visitors, we didn't know how to heat the pool and on a Saturday, he made a special trip over showing us how to work it.
Had he not done so, our Minnesota guests would not have gotten to swim.
George always goes above and beyond.
I highly recommend him for any pool or handyman job you might have.

George came over today with another person (I forgot his name) and put up used cabinets.
They were pretty worn out but both of them did a really great job on putting them up!
They look amazing.
George and his teammate were both very fast and efficient and did a good job on making everything fit together really nicely.
The price he charged me was also under the estimate he originally quoted, which was a huge blessing.
I would highly recommend this company and will definitely be using their services again!
