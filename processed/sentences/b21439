Dinkey Donkey is the Ice Cream and Breakfast Parlor connected to the Bad Donkey.
Yummy ice cream & shakes scooped with a heavy hand!

Great coffee, perfect bagels,  great egg sanwiches.
They have tracked down the Best Bagel in Phoenix Metro from a New York  bagelman recreating the magic daily (selling wholesale near Deer Valley airport)

Yummy ice cream (Cinnamon?
