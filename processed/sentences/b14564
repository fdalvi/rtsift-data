The owners are always friendly and their beds give better color than any other place I've gone to.
They have better prices too!

While I know that "fake baking" is not ideal, (especially in Arizona where there's sun pretty much every day), sometimes it's necessary so I don't glow in the dark from being so white.
I'm extremely happy I found this salon!!
It's EXTREMEly clean, has EXTREMEly awesome beds, and the staff is EXTREMEly friendly and knowledgeable.
I love their stand-up beds, and even though I'm fair skinned, they're high-intensity bulbs are awesome and don't burn, unlike other "high-intensity" beds I've tried that burned as bad as the level 1 beds.

I went in for a double dip (Tanning bed + Spray tan) The lady at the counter was extremely helpful and welcoming.
I found out later she's the owner.
For a double dip it was 30.00 which is really reasonable.
However, I don't think the spray tan worked AT ALL.
The spray felt more like air then product.
I told her and she adjusted the machine and back in I went.
The 2nd time it was a little better, but honestly I still don't think it worked.
I was in a hurry and instead of saying that yet again, it didn't work - I just told her it was fine.
When i was leaving she told me the spray booth hadn't been used in over a month.
Hmm - that might be the problem?
Anyway, I didn't have any color the next day.
Very dissapointing.

Great prices.
Owner is super nice.
I will be back to get rid of my lines this summer.
You should give this place a try.
