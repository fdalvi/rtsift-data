What does a girl do to reward herself for carefully saving to take a batchlorette trip to Vegas and winning a little on the BJ table.
Well .... go shoe shopping !
There is not a Jimmy Choo store in Michigan, so a short walk to Crystals on the top floor into the Jimmy Choo store.
The sales staff were great as I kept them back and forth trying on at least 10 pair.
Great selection in my small 5 1/2 size  I walked out an hour later with a smile on my face and great sexy pair of heels in my shinny Jimmy Choo bag.
Happy Happy  Happy

While in Vegas I spied a Jimmy Choo store and couldn't help myself but to take a walk on the wold side and look around.
Quality shoes for a high price - totally worth it if you ask me.
One day I will treat myself to a pair of Jimmy Choo's shoes and maybe even make it to Vegas again to visit this beautiful store with a great sales staff.
My shoe collection is growing exponentially and one day it will include a pair of Jimmy Choo's.
