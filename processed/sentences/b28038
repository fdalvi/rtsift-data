A new lunch favorite for our dealership.
This place has good food at great prices and delivers too.
Looking at the menu there seems to be about 100 different entrees to choose from.
The lunch menu is priced entirely under $5 with 39 different items to choose from.
The place is pretty simple inside, not too many decorations with seating outside on the patio.
Service is quick and friendly, making this a great place to go if your in a hurry.

I'm a huge fan of New York Style Chinese food.
I am pretty picky when it comes to Chinese food, and I feel qualified to judge based on the myriads of restaurants I've dined at both in the US and in China proper!
Anyway, Golden City has got it going on!
The menu is big, and the variety of choices includes chow fun noodles (my favorite,) tofu (aka bean curd) dishes galore, delicious shrimp toast and tons of yummy seafood choices.
I tried the vegetable chow fun and couldn't get enough of it!
Yum!
The only reason the place isn't getting five stars is because the service was a bit short.
Our order took ten minutes longer than expected, since they had run out of chow fun noodles.
(They sent a driver to get some from a store and cook them fresh!!!
)  We waited and then they forgot to give us our eggrolls.
No biggie, but hey it wasn't perfect.
I am very excited about this place and look forward to eating here again!

This place sucks.... We place a order for delivery for over 40 dollars and we were missing some food.
So we called them to get order order correct and they refused, so now to get our money back we have to send all of the food back.
This place is a joke.... Never order from here

Good combo meals.
Lunch specials are good.
No fountain drinks, just canned sodas.
Meals cooked hot and fresh in front of you.

I've ordered delivery from this location a few times in the past 6 months.
The food has always been rather good if not very good and I've routinely been able to get a generous amount of food for $14 delivered with tax and tip.
It sometimes takes a bit to get the food, but it's always been reasonable and the staff, despite occasional communication issues, have generally be very nice.
If you've got a bit of cash in your pocket and like good chinese food, I'd recommend this place.
