I just moved to the Phoenix area and was looking for a stylist i could trust.
Went in for a cut and color and Melanie did such a great job!
She's very knowledgeable and uses great product.
I usually don't like it when stylists are talkative during procedures but she's a very good conversationalist.
She was also telling me about the up-do work she does.
Went online and they look very classic.
Will be considering her if any special occasions pop up in the future.
Will definitely be going back!

I bought a Groupon deal for Melanie once and have been going back ever since.
She does a great job on my hair and doesn't take forever like some stylists do.
She is kind, pleasant, and her conversation is always appropriate.
I have had too many stylists that scream in your ear about boyfriends the whole time, Melanie is not one of them!
The salon she works at is always quiet and peaceful.
I enjoy going to see her.
Would recommend.
