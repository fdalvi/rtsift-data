Classic Catering is an A+ catering company in my book!
Their food is absolutely amazing, and their staff is extremely knowledgeable and friendly.
They have outstanding customer service, and since they are family owned and operated their prices are even better!
I love Italian food, so their lasagna is my favorite.
It is seriously better than my moms (I hope she doesn't see this) which I thought was impossible.
I will definitely be using them again for any events I will have in the future, and will refer them to anyone I know who needs a caterer.

Amazing catering company!
Their lasagna and 3 layer cookies are just like my mom made when I was younger!
Awesome!

This company did our Wedding rehearsal dinner the night before our wedding for about 80 people.
They did an outstanding job.
We had it at a family member's house and they brought all of the tables, chairs, table coverings, and even did a carved ice sculpture for us.
The food was excellent, and the service was great.
They also brought their bartenders to stay throughout the night.

We used Classic Catering for our wedding reception.
They were beyond fantastic.
Their pricing was incredibly reasonable, especially compared to their competition.
The food was outstanding and many of our guests have let us know they loved the food.
I especially loved their attitude.
I felt like the Pipolas were family friends helping us make our wedding day spectacular.

Would not recommend.
The food was sub par and not that reasonable $$.
Service was okay but Joseph is just rude.
Does not seem to care if he has repeat customers.
Don't understand the previous reviews.
Not our experience.

I would highly recommend classic catering for any occasion.
The food and service was incredible.
They will definitely be hearing from me again!!
Thank you for a wonderful experience.
