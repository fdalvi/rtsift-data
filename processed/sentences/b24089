I love this Milio's for the soul fact of it being a lovely local sandwich shop.
I work just down the road from this place and frequent here enough for them to know me on a first-name basis.
They are always OUTRAGEOUSLY fast which is great on a 30 min lunch break.
The place is always clean and quiet and they are always really polite here.
The sandwiches never taste stale or like the ingredients have been sitting out for a while unlike some of these locations.
It is a little small for it;s location in my opinion but I have never had to wait very long even if it were packed wall to wall here.
When I don't have time to leave work, sometimes I have them delivered.
They come right out and have only ONCE ever taken longer than 30 minutes to get to me.
So therefore, this little Milio's is one of the best places for lunch or dinner on Madison's west side.

I love this location!
The employees are always friendly and the service is super fast.
The location is in a great spot with tons of parking and the store is always clean.
Great job!

If you've been to A Milio's, you've been to them all.
This one's located in the business level of a condo development along Junction Road (near Target) - it's set back a little from the road, so it's not easily stumbled upon.
+ Simple menu + Friendly cashier + Super fast order/check-out - A bit pricey... standard sub with baked chips and soda was $10.12.
+ Super fast food prep - sandwich was complete before I could fill my soda cup - Lids for soda cups are wafer-thin and don't fit the cups very well.
I'm not a huge sub fan, but my office mates are, so I wander over here with them every so often.
If, unlike me, you fancy yourself a fan of the sub, you'll probably enjoy this place.
