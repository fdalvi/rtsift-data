I love this store.
Everything is under $1.00 as promised.
They've got tons of canned food and for someone who is single and lives alone, this is the best way to spend your money.
The portions are usually single person size.
They have everything from spices to bread to tupperware.
I go to this store once a week and get MOST of everything i need and it usually comes out to about $25.
This is definitely not possible at Safeway, Walmart, or a CVS store.
It is also pretty clean and big.
A bit crowded on the weekends.

This location has gotten filty !
However, they still have all the .99 cent items that you crave for and even have milk, bread and eggs.
I prefer the location on 43rd Ave & Bell Road.
Much cleaner.

Got everything here that I had intended to buy with a quickness and of course as the name goes everything was just 99 cents.
I got some laundry items, a couple packs of hangers (10 pieces) and office supplies.
The store itself looked a bit dingy, has that Walmart vibe to it, slow cashiers and the parking lot is sketchy with it's roaming shopping carts, wandering people and litter.
4 stars for the cheap price of the items although you give up the idea of quality and 2 stars for the uncomfortably dirty store and parking lot.
I'd go to a different location.
