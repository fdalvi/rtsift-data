The name says it all.
Located a few doors down from its sister store Electric Ladyland.
Floozy carries overpriced reconstructed old T-shirts, bedazzled sweatshirts and overly embellished jeans.
Unless you are a teenager on her way to a Clay Aiken Concert I would pass on Floozy.

Loses points because it is run by the same people as Electric Ladyland... but the sales people here are young, harmless, and generally eager to please.
And it gets major points for carrying like, the entire Joe's Jeans denim collection.
I'm talking every cut in every wash.  Other than that, pretty useless unless you are into the $100 used T-shirt look.

Tacky, but not tacky enough to be fun.
I'm all for cheesy rhinestone belts and bedazzled t-shirts but this store only carries overpriced goods for aging teenager wannabes (read: cougars).
But I might be biased because I really am confused by the people from Electric Ladyland and they own this place too.
