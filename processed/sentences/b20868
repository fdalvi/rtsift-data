I have to say, I've never been a great fan of GAP.
I find their clothes overpriced, odd sizes and they never seem that appealing either.
If you're a fan of GAP then this is a reasonable sized branch with a good range of stock and they have a good range of sizes too even though the small ones are still too big for me.
This particular branch also has a welcoming atmosphere and I was asked by two different staff members if I needed any help.
This store offers clothes for men, women, children and there's even a small section for tiny tots too.

My girlfriend used to work here many years ago, and as I always met her after work I ended up spending a vast amount of time looking around this well sized shop in the middle of Ocean Terminal.
At first, I was never very impressed by the clothes that GAP offered - but over time I began to like them, and I must admit I still shop here now - although it is a bit hit or miss, sometimes you will find something you just have to buy and other times there wont be anything you fancy.
Staff seemed very friendly (even excluding my girlfriend!!
) and over all I came to quite like this branch of GAP.

I really want to like GAP, I really do.
I like the carefree adverts and the springy hipster good-looking models in their colourful well coordinated outfits.
I aspire to look like them.
This shop however doesn't live up to it.
It is a combined baby/kids GAP (left) with a 'normal' GAP (right) The shop is too small to feel like a US Branch of hip clothing - the staff is a bit too disinterested in helping out.
The last 2-3 years I have been here, browsed around and I think I bought in total 1 shirt and a pair of undies (on sale).
They haven't changed the lay out for years now and I get a bit bored when shopping there.
