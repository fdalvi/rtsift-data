Great landfill.
Most of its inside and well maintained the only landfill that doesn't stink!!!
If your a city of Phoenix residence you are allowed one free dump so go check it out!

I can't say I have very much dump experience, but I think this place would spoil a visit at any other dump.
It's well organized, the people are friendly and best of all, it doesn't completely reek!
The last time I was there, they gave us a friendly reminder that any uncovered load would be fined starting soon.
So remember that you must throw a tarp over your stuff, no matter how little!

What a line on the weekend....the people in the office could be more organized and the rent a cop could stop trying to wave his arms and talk less!
Get people in and out!

Citizens of Phoenix utilize a benefit that you pay for monthly!!!!
Bring an id and a current water bill and drop your bulk trash monthly!
Thus place is awesome and if you have a child bring them for the display of heavy machinery at work.
I love coming here although it is a chore it removes unwanted bulk items from my home.
Time to live yelpers!!
