Let's face it, all girls have numerous pairs of perfectly good shoes that can no longer be worn because of broken heels or holes in the soles.
Instead of being sensible and taking them to the menders, most of us resign them to the back of a cupboard and mourn their absence.
I resolved to stop doing this and took my beloved red boots (worn heels, holes in the soles) to SOS repairs in Bruntsfield.
Within an hour the friendly cobbler had them looking fabby again and all for the princely sum of £18.
Job's a good 'un.

It's my hen night on Saturday (because that's totally relevant to this review...) and the plastic nub-thing (official term) had disappered from the heels of shoes that match the dress I might wear.
I had a mini- freak out when I realised that the shoes needed to be fixed and I would need a 24 hour turnaround on it.
But, there was no need to worry as when I popped into SOS he guy said "oh, that'll just take two minutes to fix" and while I waited he told me about how walking through grass can pull these bits out of shoes, and that there are bits and pieces of women's heels all over the Meadows.
He then continued his small talk into work, my hen night (ok I may have brought that one up), etc, while he sorted my shoes.
At the end of it, I parted with a mere £7 and was very pleased with myself.
So, thumbs up to the friendly SOS guy.

For a long time I had put of getting the heels on my favourite pair of boots fixed, it is just so easy not to!
I had (like most girls I think) several other pairs of shoes that needed a new heel and I also needed to make a couple of copies of my keyes for my friends that were coming over.
I went up to SOS and he fixed my shoes and copied my keyes in no-time.
Now I am sure that my wonderful boots will last me a few more seasons!
The cobbler was friendly, fast and gave me a very decent price.
When the day comes (and it will come) when I need more shoes fixed I will definetly go back!
