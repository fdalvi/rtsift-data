The Liquor Outlet  is a place I have always passed as I drive around town.
One day awhile back I was on mission to find Skyy Cherry.
I searched  other liquor stores, even grocery and casino liquors stores with no luck.
(later found out the distributor was out for 2 weeks)  I stopped in to The Liquor Outlet to see if they had any.
I felt like I hit the jack pot.
They had 5 bottles.
I purchased them all.
The pricing and selection is similar to Lee's.
The workers here are so much more friendly/ helpful and welcoming than the Lee's down the street.
Whenever I am on a mission to pick up more liquor (quite often) or am searching for something specific I can't seem to find at Total  Wine or the usual suspects I come here.
I have found out of season gift packs here,  and items I am looking for  on several occasions.
This isn't my go to store but the friendly employees, the decent selection and the luck Ive had finding certain items keep me checking back from time to time.
I'm glad I didn't keep the  name  I'm not familiar with keep me away from the Liquor Outlet.
They are open late and if you too are looking for something you can't seem to find, try looking here, I've had luck and I hope you would too.

Great customer service , great prices.
They have every drink you can name.
They even had my favorite wine Gewurztraminer.
Nice German white wine

Worst store ever!!!
Puts expired wines on the shelf and will not refund.
Four out of the five bottles of wine I bought in there have been no good.
The last one was so old the cork wouldn't even come out of it.
I think they left it in the sun.
Will never go back!!
