Cool atmosphere and good food, too bad the help doesn't match up.

I actually stepped foot on the property of a Ford dealer.
I have driven by this diner for years and had even had a friend recommend it.
When I went in I assumed I would be waited on and took a table.
Nothing happened so I went up to where there was a sign saying "order here".
Still not sure if that was for take out only or not but I got my order in and pretty soon lunch was brought to me.
I had to wait for iced tea to be brewed.
I'll most likely go again to try something else as the food was pretty good and a good value ordering that day's lunch special.

It was a very nice surprise to have this at the Sanderson Ford Dealership.
Good thing my service guy mentioned it or I probably wouldn't have known.
I would have just went to sit in the waiting room.
I was starving!
CUTE place, employees were not very friendly.
I ordered thie Fiesta Brekfast Burrito-eggs, cheese, potato and bacon.
The egg, cheese and bacon were basically nonexistent.
HOWEVER, it was very hot!
It did seem to take a little longer to make than you'd find at another place who frequently makes burritos.
I wasn't in a hurry.
I imagine anyone just going to this diner would be a tad disappointed, but it you have time to pass, it's fine.

good food, cheap eats
