Wow is all I can say.
Steve has taken so much time with me and helped me through so much with my accident.
He has saved me so much, he is a lifesaver.
If you want a old school insurance agent who cares more about u then money he is your guy.
Give him a try

Farmers has a great community service program called M.I.L.K.
(Managing Information of Lost Kids) As a member of a local Karate Studio that was having a Kids Safety Event, I was very impressed that Steve was willing to dedicate part of his Saturday to come to the Dojo and educate parents about what to do incase their child goes missing.
This says to me that Steve cares about what is going on in his community, not just about selling insurance.
I think its important in this day and age to have an Insurance Agent who cares about his individual customers needs and is willing to go the extra mile in order to earn their trust and respect.
I highly recommend giving Steve a call for all your insurance needs.
I have already referred him to 1 friend and will be sending more.

When I needed insurance for my photography studio I called on Steve Miller.
Even though he personally was not able to help me he was very professional and found me another agent and insurance company to work with.
Steve is fast, efficient and very reliable!
Thanks Steve!

I'm from out of state and Steve was great in helping me get insurance for my vacation home.
He took the time to explain everything and worked with agent in my home state to get me the best deal possible.

Great customer service, attentive and a good quote.

Steve did a great job for us.
He works hard to get your needs met and your questions answered.
His support staff is also prompt and professional.
If you are looking to change/update your insurance coverage would reccomend giving Steve a chance to quote your needs.
