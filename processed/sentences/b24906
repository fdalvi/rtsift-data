-Front door greeter was nice and cordial, of course it happen to also be the Store Manager.
-Employee "Ryan" provided cold, robot-like service and was quite condescending too!
If you get this guy, then ask for someone else, unless you like that!
(IMO, Ryan would be better suited working as a TSA Gov't Worker.
)  -Parking was convenient.
-Wait time not too bad.
-Located in the Target/Kohl's shopping center, near the car wash.  -My third visit to this store (whenever I'm in the area), the service is not impressive at this location.
-I always get matched up with a MEAN employee, while I observe the customer next to me being helped by a friendly employee!
Inconsistant service.
Avoid.

Easy in easy out.Much better service than the store on bell the manager was very help .the rep was very nice and extremely helpful.To me this is how a Verizon store should be operated

This is one of the better Verizon's that I've been to.
There was no wait and my phone was fixed in no time.

Maybe it was due to the time, 230 on a Tuesday, but, this was the emptiest vzw store I've ever been to.
Walked in, bought a tablet with no hassle.
David did disparage my wanting to buy a case on Amazon as opposed to paying $50.
P. S.  I found the same case on Amazon for half the price

Zero stars.
Unacceptable wait.
Unacceptable customer service with a "sorry just deal with it attitude.
" Although that seems to be Verizon's way regardless of how you're trying to get assistance.
