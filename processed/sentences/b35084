Hey, Yelpers, less of a review, more of a preview.
However, I have eaten at The Melville Inn, so I've put my mouth where my money is.
Yes, you'll find the landlord, or manager as they're called these days - Derek - out on the floor, serving customers, just like the rest of his staff.
Don't take my word for it though, Carolyn, one of the top team, won the Scotland round of the in-house servers competition, and was silver medalist in the whole UK in 2012 - against 200 other Vintage Inn pubs.
What's got me excited though is the October Tarot Evening.
It's a first for the venue and, given the low-lighting, log-fire intimate surroundings, it should be a hoot.
I'm minded to notch up five stars, because the Melville delivers what you expect, and delivers it well - good, family friendly food; plenty of atmosphere; and just the occasional surprise too.
Rate me, rate my rating when you go.

New Management, great atmosphere, good service.
Worth all 5 stars!

Nice restaurant in the middle of nowhere.
Lots of rooms and cozy corners and even real fire place.

I'd heard that the "Melville" had undergone a refurbishment and had changed it's menu, so, off I popped for lunch.
I love a good salad, so went for the Pear & Stilton Salad.
It was so fresh, tasty and full of flavor.
The Pear went so well with the Stilton.
The dressing was spot on, I was very impressed.
To follow, I had the Rare Roast Beef Sandwich with (optional) Gourmet Chips.
The Chips were dead yummo and would've been a course all to themselves.
The Rare Beef Sandwich was scrumptious, tender and all too more-ish.
If I had to criticise I'd have to say it was too heavy on the Horseradish, but, other than that it was fab.
One of the guest ales on tap was, Adnams Mosaic Ale which washed everything down just right.
I had a table by the window and was able to watch cute bunny rabbits have their lunch too (I love animals!).
The welcome and service was exemplary, not a hint if "B.S".
Thoroughly and totally recommended!
