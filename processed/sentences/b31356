Staff was very helpful!
They test our water all the time and have been helping us get our pool of the hook for the summer.

Last summer, I bought a pair of goggles, and before I'd even worn them, I foolishly left them in the car, and they melted.
These guys let me exchange them, which I thought was very nice of them.
Since then, I've used them for all my pool-related needs.
Don't forget - if you buy goggles, don't leave them in the hot car!

Wes was very helpful.
He answered ALL of my stupid questions.
