English Laundry has landed!
A favorite label by many stars not for the name but the style, cut, and fit.
I was excited when I was walking around Town Square in Las Vegas and stumbled upon this gem of a store.
"Could it be?
Yes, it is THE English Laundry brand!
And they're having a sale!!!
BONUS!
Their cut and sew button up shirts come pre-tailored and tapered to contour your body for a very nice looking fit.
Everything they have is quality.
Stylish bowties will turn any nerd into desired.
And if they have their men's fragrance in stock, you're in luck!
Buy one or two.
They usually sell out very quickly.

I found the cutest shirt from this store.
I happened to pass by since my fiance and I were waiting in line for our round of Wine Tasting.
I saw a big sign that said 50% off, so I gave in and took a look around.
The designer looks like he loves the Beatles and has a lot of pieces dedicated to Beatles song, I mean who doesn't like the Beatles?
The gentleman that was assisting us was very kind.
While I had my mind set on the dress shirt, he also suggested a nice black dress for me which was nice.
A bit pricey for my range, but the 50% off really helped me on making my decision to purchase.
I wouldn't of purchased had it not been on sale.
BUT none the less I surely would recommend this place.

This store is great !
Nice price point and an overall good environment !
The staff offer wine or water and are very polite and give the best service in town.
The men's collection is amazing and the women's collection is growing and looks great!
Must stop in when your at town square.

Beautiful store, great selection and excellent customer service!
