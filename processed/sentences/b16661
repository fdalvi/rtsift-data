About the only positive I can think of for this location is that it is open 24 hours.
Then ago, so are ALL 7-Eleven's.
Store just does not have much in the way of selection, and as with all convienience stores, prices are quite high.
Have never had any bad experiences when at this store, it's more a matter of the store being small and lacking much of a selection.
Workers at this location have always been nice, so that is a place.
And, this location has a Redbox, which is another plus.
