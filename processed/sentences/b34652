Après la fermeture du O'Sheas juste à côté, c'est le Slush qui a récupérer les tables de Beer Pong... Ambiance garantie !
Kevin et Jeremy sont les serveurs qui sont en place le soir, hyper sympas, n'oubliez pas les tips car ils le méritent amplement!!

Fantastic!
Filled my yard from another store to the brim with rum and pina colada!
Gave us a great show with the bottles and taste tested my drink (with a little tester spoon) and added even more rum!
Needless to say, had an amazing time!!!
I'll be refilling my yards there for a long time!

Best frozen drink bar ever!
Large drink menu, and bartenders suggest delicious combos that aren't on the menu.
Friendly and TALENTED staff, entertaining and hard working.

Located inside of Bill's.
Great frozen drinks made to order.
Bartenders do a little flippity dippity for ya.
Try it if you're near by.

Got very friendly service, but the Slushes that my husband and I got were undrinkable.
There is a difference between a strong drink and one that is SO strong that you shudder and nearly bounces right back up out of your stomach.
I'm kind of a wimp when it comes to alcoholic beverages, but my husband is NOT.
Even he agreed with me.
Slushy frozen drinks should be tasty sweet and enjoyable...sadly, these were not.
Our server was really friendly and did some bottle flipping tricks.
It's a bummer I didn't like the end product.

We went to the Slush Bar to get our slushy cups while in Vegas.
The bartender was really friendly and she told us to go down to Old Vegas and to make sure we saw the fountain show in front of the Bellagio (which we later did).
The smallest cup was 10 bucks but was by no means small, so my friend and I got that.
I got the Banana Foster and the price for the drink plus the cup was the $10 which is awesome for Vegas because drinks are expensive there and like I said it came with the cup!
Compared to some of the other places it is very reasonably priced here and I would definitely go back.
The banana foster frozen drink was yummy and my friend's strawberry daiquiri was yum too!
Thumbs up Slush Bar!
