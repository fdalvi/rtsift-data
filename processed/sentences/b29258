I was on my way to try Thai food from Archi's after an earlier appointment, however as I drove past the intersection of Rainbow and Sahara and looking for the name of a Japanese restaurant that I have wanted to try but somehow never did, I noticed that it has been replaced with a new Japanese restaurant and a big Grand Opening banner.
This restaurant is Sato-Ya.
It is literally a family run business that has the dad working at the sushi bar, the mom and other Japanese cooks working in the kitchen and I believe the son running the front as the waiter and cashier.
I decided to try their lunch combo and picked Yakiniku and Pork Cutlet and also Salmon Roll out of the available options.
A House Salad dressed in Miso dressing was quickly served (it was nice but a little too much dressing, as there were still a lot left after I was done with the greens).
The Miso Soup followed shortly and it is comforting.
After a short wait the main entree was delivered to the table, which I took pictures of, but have to quickly devour so I can be on time for my next appointment.
The Yakiniku was okay.
It tastes fine, but the thin slices of beef was overcooked for my taste, but the tonkatsu was good.
While I waited for my meal to be prepared I also checked out their dinner menu, which has a larger selection and also a Dinner Special section.
They also have Happy Hour from 8pm until they close at 10:30pm, which serves 1/2 items from the HH menu.
The thing I was most impressed with is the fact that it is actually run by Japanese, and not Koreans, Chinese or other ethnicity, and in a subtle way you can taste the difference if you know what to look for.
Not that there is anything inherently wrong with those other Japanese restaurants, but when you are looking for pure Japanese, especially with an Okinawan flavor, Sato-Ya is the place to be.
Plus the service was impeccable.
The waiter checked on all the tables to make sure we were okay, and bring out whatever we ask (more water, tea, etc.
) in a timely manner.
And when you pay your bill and is on your way out, he walks quickly ahead and opens the dorr for you.
Now you don't see that everyday, and certainly not at a non-Michelin Star restaurant.
I will definitely be back soon to try more of their menu.
So stay tuned for the updates and the photos of the menu and the food to be uploaded after my class.
4 Stars for the overall dining experience, especially on the account of the superb service.
-- Review of Dinner on 9-22-10 -- Leos called me about doing dinner at a new Japanese restaurant, and it turned out to be Sato-ya, where I ate lunch earlier in the day.
So we agreed to go after our class, and I can check out their other items.
We ordered off their HH & Daily Specials menu and also an Okinawa Soba Noodle (looks like udon, but tastes different, and the meat is really tender) and I thought it was good.
Albacore - good and expert attention was applied.
Goyo Chanpuru - Okinawan Bitter Melon sauteed with Spam and egg.
Homey and I enjoyed it.
Futomaki - A little different from what I have had (no spinach), but still good.
Chicken Tatsuta-age - Fried marinated chicken breasts.
Alright.
Crispy Rice w/ Spicy Tuna - Sushi rice that is fried so it is crispy topped with spicy tuna.
Different from your typical sushi places.
Reminds us of MOS Burger items.
We spoke to the owner and sushi chef "Habu" (a poisonous snake in Okinawa) and you can tell he is very passionate and an artisen in his craft.
Totally cool in my book!
And he made a decorative Japanese Stork (C. Boyciana) out of 1/2 an orange!
Plus showed us his avocado seed carvings!!!
- again didn't know you can do that.
I eat at a lot of AYCE sushi places, but you almost never get that kind of connection with those sushi chef like we did with Chef "Habu".
We will be back for more.

Sato Ya was Kikuhana, but changed names a few months ago.
The place is small, but cozy and a really family atmosphere.
It is a "family" run business with mother, father, and son.
We had various items from the dinner menu to see how we would like the food.
Let me tell you, it is Japanese Home Style food.
Nothing fancy, but very good.
We had the pork in apple-ginger sauce and it was great.
The pork was tender and the favors were not over powering.
The sushi was good, but not the best we have had in Las Vegas.
But don't take this as a negative because places that have great sushi don't have home-style Japanese food.
The two types of miso soup were wonderful and the goyza was good.
The udon dishes were great.
They make they own soup (according to the son).
And it was GREAT!
The food is plentiful, but the price is a little high.
However, the quality is amazing.
You have to have the Honey Toast for dessert!!!!
It was WONDERFUL!!!
Overall, I would give Sao Ya an A++ for service.
The atmospshere gets an A+.
The prices get an A.
The sushi gets a B.
The Family gets an A+++++.
We'll be back soon with all of our friends and family!!!!
The place is hard to find, but it sits right behind OPA, Greek food on the corner of Sahara and Rainbow.

After reading Tony T's review, I had to venture this strange westward direction, manifest destiny for good Japanese food.
I entered Sato-ya and sat at the sushi bar.
Chef Sato greeted me and explained that "ya" means house so essentially I was eating in his "home.
"  That sounded nice already!
The window of the restaurant has a flat screen showcasing their food (pretty cool).
Inside there were specials listed.
I immediately noticed the Aji (Spanish Mackerel) and ordered it first.
Chef Sato did something Teri C. would appreciate - he carefully placed ginger and scallion on the fish with a long chopstick.
The Aji was awesome, so I next ordered shimesaba (Japanese mackerel).
The chef was surprised - an American likes mackerel this much???
ahh yes I am weird.
The saba was delicately cured, moist, and perfect, topped with a piece of kelp.
I also enjoyed agedashi tofu (good broth, crisp on outside, soft on inside, daikon and scallion) and endless hot tea as my comfort on the cool night.
Green hot tea is FREE and unlimited!
(free edamame too) Next I ordered yellowtail, and immediately noticed Chef Sato gave me belly cuts.
I thanked him and he smiled, noting that I liked fatty and oily fish so he gave me the best cut.
A regular joined me at the bar and talked about the great food.
Then I had a salmon skin handroll (on special as well) complete with gobo root, bonito flake, and kaiware sprouts.
It was a bit small but less than $3.
Chef Sato blowtorched whole scallop sushi for me.
He left the abductor muscle on, so I removed it (that only seems to happen at Japanese establishments and not Korean-owned).
He topped it with yuzu pepper - a zingy heat for sure!
I finished the meal with uni, and it was succulent and fresh.
They had the Wednesday night college football game on, Chef Sato taught me some Japanese, and a couple at a nearby table just moved back to LV from Okinawa and were telling me about Japan.
Before I left, four Japanese friends sat at the bar.
The lady gave me suggestions for my honeymoon in Japan and told me Sato-ya is her favorite authentic place in town.
I can't wait to return!
*Happy hour starts at 8PM*

I heard this place running by Japanese so I really want to try their real Japanese food.
While I waited my friend, I saw most table occupied with Japanese.
I felt I am at right place for Japanese food.
I got sushi combo as my lunch and Albacore sashimi as an appetiazers.
Sushi rice was good, fish was nice and crispy rice cake with spicy tuna was delicious.
Their ginger dressing for salad was tasty.
Service was really good too.
Next time I will try Nabeyaki Udon for sure.
I heard their soup is good.

I loved this place.
I was so excited that I could actually order my food in Japanese.
The food was tasty and reasonably priced!
I'm definitely going back!
I got their Trio combo with beef yakiniku, chicken teriyaki, and a california roll.
It came with rice, a salad, and miso soup.
I've never really liked the ginger dressing on any salad but this one was really tasty!
I actually finished it!
Miso soup was also not so brown and tasted really refreshing.
The rice was great with my yakiniku and chicken teriyaki.
The california roll was delicious!
I'm going to have to come back and try more of the sushi.

***Happy Hours from 8pm-10:30pm***  **closed on Sundays**   After reading Lisa L & Tony T's reviews, I decided to try this place right away...
I absolutely trust their taste of food :)  I am very pleased to find this cozy place run by a nice Japanese family that I can enjoy the tasty Japanese dishes all the time.
First of all, the service is fantastic!!!
The servers are very attentive, always smile, and knowledgeable about the menu.
Whenever, I am at this place, most of the customers are the local Japanese.
They casually dine at the sushi bar and seems like they all enjoy having a conversation with a sushi chef, Sato :) They always talk quietly...
I have tried..  asari miso soup(not salty at all, tasty clams were served in the soup), assorted sashimi dinner entree, all kinds of nigiris(very fresh), Japanese ceviche(if you like the taste of citrus ponzu, you will like it), crispy rice with spicy tuna(well blended taste of mayo spicy tuna & sliced jalapenos on top of crunch rice,, It's so delicious that  I always end up ordering more), spicy muscle roll(one of my favorite rolls), saba nitsuke(makerel seasoning with sake & dark soy sauce,,able to taste of sweetness & ginger,,love it!
), seared tuna sashimi with salsa(the salsa was the bomb-avocado, red onion, tomato, cucumber & the chef's secret sauce), nabeyaki udon(the broth was really good), the lunch box, and more.
I definitely can say it is a great local Japanese restaurant that you can quietly enjoy your meal with your company or by yourself at any time of the day.

Although the food is fantastic here, the unfortunately truth is that there is a slight bug problem at the sushi bar, and for that reason I am deducting two stars from this review.
Sato-ya was one of those places that we visited a long time ago, but because of a cockroach problem, we never returned.
Assuming that they changed their ways based on the current reviews, we went by the other day and sat at the sushi bar for a late dinner (8pm).
We ordered quite a bit of nigiri and some appetizers.
All were priced well and were great portions.
Creamy rock shrimp: Yummy in the tummy.
It's definitely creamy, a bit spicy, and the shrimp is sweet.
I loved every bite.
It was like firecracker shrimp but better.
Tempura roll: Perfect.
Theirs has cucumber, avocado, shrimp, and spicy mayo.
It wasn't drenched in anything.
I loved it.
All the nigiri was portioned well and the rice for the sushi is AWESOME.
It reminds me of Sugarfish in LA.
The fish is tempered right, too.
Man oh man.
I love this place.
Then, out of nowhere I was struck in the heart by several small roaches approaching me from the corner of the sushi bar.
I look up, and there they are--a literal infestation hanging out between the wood of the bar, crawling out along the wall and the counter.
What concerns me is the amount of roaches, the fact that they are baby ones, and the fact that there are black dots of bug feces where they were coming out of.
We hadn't received our entire order, and at that point it was difficult to swallow--literally.
We paid and then told the server on the way out of the problem.
I posted a pic of one little roachy on the sushi bar on their yelp profile.
I hope they fix this.
If there's one thing I cannot handle no matter where it's located in a restaurant, are bugs, and for the roaches to crawl out on to my plates, I don't think I can go back.

If you're looking for authentic Japanese food with great prices, this is the place to go.
Love the food and friendly service.
I would recommend going through the whole happy hour menu.

We came here for Lisa L.'s UYE and I was pleased to see another Japanese-run Japanese restaurant.
Pretty much all of us got the $12.95 special-3 different rolls to choose from...food tasted great, simple and straightforward, and the service was just as good.
definitely one of the spots to hit up if you're ever in the area...ALOHA!!

Lisa L's ROTD reminded me that I haven't reviewed this place.
We went for Lisa's UYE about a month back.
I'll be honest.
I wasn't wowed by the food, but it was simple and satisfying.
What I love about Sato-ya is the friendly family environment you can only get with a place such as this.
They were very accommodating and helpful.
It really felt like you were in their home.
Except for the paying part.
The prices were certainly pocket-friendly though.
For about $13, you get to choose three items from a specials menu.
That's pretty good for three rolls of sushi (or a combination of sushi and other kitchen items).
Toward the end of the meal, we were curious about the Mozuku that was written on their specials board.
They were generous enough to give us all samples; it's an interesting dish made of super thin seaweed.
If I'm ever in their part of town again, I definitely wouldn't mind visiting Chef Sato and family again.

Great sushi!
I ordered a lunch special, the sushi combo dish for $9.95.
Not a bad deal.
It came with miso soup (or udon), 4 pieces of a california roll, 4 pieces of a tuna roll, and 7 sample pieces of sushi.
I'm not a huge sushi person, but the fish was fresh and yummy.
The rolls were finely made as well.
I loved the ginger, which I normally am not a fan of.
The ginger was lighter in color, and not as powerful in taste as the typical red ginger that you find.
This place is definitely better than most of the Korean ran sushi places (no offense to Koreans).
There were lots of Japanese people eating here, both older Japanese couples, and younger college students probably from the Charleston CSN campus.
I can't wait to come back and try the dinners!

Yum.
Okinawan soba contained the most delish spare rib.
Crispy rice w/ spicy tuna on top was the most refreshing taste treat.
Too bad I was a couple weeks too early in the season to try the goya champaru, next time....

The BEST Japanese food in Vegas !!!
The restaurant is so clean you could eat off the floor and the fish is soooo very fresh !!!
Everything was perfect here .... even the music ...lol

Satoya is really a hidden Gem in Las Vegas.
Japanese owned and operated.
The provide fantastic service delicios food and great entertainment ( yes entertainment) at a very reasonable price.
What makes Satoya unique is that the Owners are from the Okinawa Islands of Japan.
Along with all of your traditional Japanese style favorites ( sushi, Sashimi, Rolls, Grilled food etc) They also have a select menu of traditional OKinawan Food.
These Okinawan foods are hard to find (impossible??
) in the Las Vegas area and we were pleased when we discovered that they had such Okinawa Specialites as Okinawa Soki Soba, Taco Rice, Goya Chanpuru, Somen Chanpuru, Rafuty and more!
What REALLY makes this place great is that they have Video screens with scenes of the Okinawan islands Showing , and relaxing Okinawan style folk music playing in the background.
When we were they actually had a live Shamisen performer playing quietly in the background while we ate.
It really gave us the feeling of being in Japan, or Okinawa.
I asked the waitress about the Shamisen player and she told me that the have a live performance every 2nd and 4th friday, 3 times nightly!
I guess this guy (the shamisen or Sanshin player ) is pretty famous and travels back and forth to Okinawa alot  FOOD we ordered a variety of food from sushi to grilled to noodles, and it was all WONDERFUL Our only complaint is that we couldnt stay as long as we would have liked, because o f an early morning flight the next day !
We will definately be back

Sato and his family have made MY family feel so special every time go... whether it's making a special dinner ending orange sculpture OR bringing us something from the kitchen to try.
My favorite Japanese restaurant in Vegas

Terrific place for Sushi.
Very friendly staff and the sushi was absolutely wonderful.
Their special was very valuable.
Three eight piece rolls for 12.95 if you order a beverage.
The three of us had plenty to eat on just two specials worth (6 rolls).
Better than any sushi we have had on the strip and about 20% of the price.
We will enjoy Sato-ya everytime we are in Las Vegas.

This place is at the TOP of my list of favs in the Vegas area.
The owners/operators are very nice and accommodating, from Okinawa and brings that culture to the restaurant and food they serve.
One of the things to be sure to experience is one of their Okinawa Nights where they have most of the traditional Okinawan foods and of course Orion beer.
I've had a few of the sushi rolls, and although I haven't gone there specifically for those I have been impressed with the taste and presentation of it all.

This is truly as good as it gets.
The freshest sushi I've ever had on the continental US.
The prices are perfect and there's even a late night happy hour.
Its impossible not to find something amazing on the menu.
This is my new reason for going to Las Vegas!

I waffled between 3 and 4 stars throughout the meal.
What made me go with 4 is the excellent service and the honey toast.
Loves me some honey toast!
We tried the garlic edamame, beef tataki, spicy tuna over crispy rice, agedashi tofu, chicken yakitori, spicy albacore roll, and honey toast.
The garlic edamame was covered in slices of garlic, so you either got a ton of garlic or a vague garlic flavor.
I like the garlic edamame at Sen of Japan and Nagoya better where they actually finely chopped the garlic.
A more consistent flavor.
The tofu, yakitori, and spicy albacore were average.
The spicy tuna over crispy rice was definitely a standout.
My husband ordered this without consulting me and I tried this dish for the first time at Simon a while back and was not impressed.
This was totally different.
The rice was crispy and light, not chewy and dense like Simon.
I definitely recommend getting this.
As we finished our meal, I kept hearing our server recommend honey toast for dessert to other tables.
I love honey toast at Ichiza and I got all excited.
We ordered it but when I saw it delivered to other tables I was worried.
It has whipped cream on it... and is that chocolate sauce?
But it was the best honey toast ever!
Not as messy, burnt, or awkward as the Ichiza honey toast.
You can eat every bite with a spoon, including the toast.
The chocolate sauce tasted great and there is enough ice cream to go with each bite of toast.
Yummy!
Happy hour is from 8-close when they offer food, beer, and sake for $2-4.
They also have a menu throughout the day where they offer a list of items at 3 for $12.95.
The HH menu and the $12.95 menu overlap and depending on what you order, it could be a better deal to order off the HH menu or the $12.95 menu.
This requires some advanced math skills and is just not my thing.
Also, it reminds me of Applebee's, which is never a good thing.
(Has anyone noticed they sell the same thing in 10 different combinations at 10 different prices at Applebee's?
It's annoying.
)  But then again, if I end up spending $2 more because I can't do math, so be it.
Our server was super nice and attentive.
It's definitely a fun and friendly place.
I'll be back!

This was the freshest sushi I have ever eaten!
My husband and I were very impressed.
Service was friendly and we sat at the sushi bar which was immaculately clean.
We had 3 choices of sushi for $12.95.
Fantastic deal!
Everything we had was amazing.
Miso soup, spicy tuna w crispy rice, soft shell crab roll and the Philadelphia roll.
You can't go wrong.
I can't wait to go back and rip through their menu for more tasty delicacies.
The best food in Vegas is clearly OFF of the strip.
So happy to be a local!

I'm usually one to go to places that serve all-you-can-eat sushi (due to my incredible ability to eat large quantities of sushi), but Sato-ya is definitely the place to go if you want delicious Japanese food, with perfect portions, and the perfect prices.
I have got to say, the spicy tuna over crispy rice is my absolute faaaave!
They have several deals that are definitely worth checking out: Pay 12.95 and select 3 items off of their selected menu of hot items and sushi, the Treasure Boat dinner that includes chicken or beef teriyaki, Salmon or black cod, lobster dynamite, fried scallops, tempura, sashimi, nigiri, and california rolls for under 50 dollars, and the happy hour pricing from 8pm to closing.
Do not forget to order the honey toast for dessert!
Aside from the great food, the staff is so friendly and always smiling.
It truly makes you feel like you are being taken care of by people who care about their customers and the quality of their service.

Great prices, very fresh sushi, friendly service.
The sushi chef is actually from Okinawa which helps keep the menu more true to Japanese flavors.
The seaweed they use for sushi has incredible flavor!
This place is now one of my regular sushi spots!

Fantastic, authentic and very fresh Japanese food.
They will even cater to vegans.
The staff is wonderful there.
Prices are very easy on the wallet.
Must go!

All around good enough......   Sato-ya has a lot of things going for it, here are a few:  comfortable dining room with lots of "Japanese" decor, super friendly staff w/ good service, and great prices.
They have a dinner special where you can pick three items for $12.95 which include a lot of sushi and a few cooked items.
You also have to order a miso soup or a beverage to get this deal, so it ends up coming out to right under $20 w/ tax, which is still an outrageously great value.
**A few of the items require a $2 up charge, but you don't have to order those.
We ended up ordering two of the specials, here is what he had:  Miso Soup - Balanced flavors, a little on the salty side but still quit satisfying.
Japanese "Ceviche" - Chopped sashimi (tuna, salmon, and yellowtail) with some jalapenos, red pepper in a soy/miso based sauce.
This dish was tasty and fresh, but not a lot of fish really.
Agedashi Tofu - Topped with grated Daikon radish in a light soy sauce.
Good flavor, but the inside of the tofu was a bit slimy.
It didn't seem like they used firm tofu, which could be why it was more gloppy than I've had elsewhere.
Creamy Rock Shrimp - Small shrimp tossed in a heavy mayo/sriraucha sauce.
The shrimp were mushy beneath the heavy sauce.
I'd avoid this one, there are better options.
Creamy Rock Shrimp w/ spicy tuna sushi - Same complaint about the shrimp as above, although this time it was on top of a spicy tuna roll.
It was just too much going on, too much mayo, and not enough pronounced flavor.
Crispy rice w/ spicy tuna - The rice was perfectly crisped to give that crunchy texture, but the tuna itself was lacking a lot of flavor.
It wasn't spicy, however the sliver of jalapeno on top helped add  a little heat.
Shrimp Tempura roll - Very standard.
I liked that the roll wasn't huge, so the pieces were a reasonable size to take down in one gobble.
I left the meal with a bit of a stomach ache, most likely from the heavy mayo sauce on the shrimp dishes.
I would come back, but I wouldn't rush to do so.

Bring from Okinawa, we had our 15 year high school reunion in Vegas and had to spend the last night at an izakaya opened by an Okinawan!
I was the DD so I didn't drink much but as a group, we ate and drank the lights out and the bill came out to around $20 / person!
Insane!
We stayed way past their business hour and they were very kind and offered a large bottle of Orion for us.
Love it!

Was at Sato-ya for the first time last night.
It is now--hands down--my "FLAVOR"-ite Japanese restaurant in Las Vegas!
If you haven't been here yet, you're missing out!
With its killer combination of fresh, quality sushi, delicious Japanese cuisine, and oustanding customer service at fair prices, what more could anyone ask for?
Our group ordered the seafood boat with seasoned lobster, teriyaki chicken, teriyaki salmon, assorted tempura, & more.
We also had fresh salad, the standard yet still yummy miso soup, plus items from the happy hour menu including $2 edamame, rock shrimp, $4 yakitori, $4?
softshell crab, and various sushi.
We also ordered the black cod which was so divine that it virtually melted in our mouths!
Even the hot tea is good here!
To top off our amazing dinner we had the delicious honey toast, which is vanilla ice cream atop honey-glazed toast.
I CAN'T wait until my next visit at this hidden gem...AMAZING!!

I'm a fan of this mom and pop Japanese restaurant....literally the mom is the server and the dad is the sushi chef.
We ended up grabbing a late dinner and they have happy hour from 8-close everyday with items ranging from $2-$5 on selected items.
They also have a special that goes on for dinner where you can choose 3 items (hot dishes and sushi rolls) for $12.95 with the purchase of miso ($2) or a beverage ($1-2 for iced tea/soda).
We ended up trying the katsu skewers, rock shrimp tempura, crispy rice tuna, chicken kaarage, fried rice, and crunchy california roll.
Everything was pretty tasty, the only hang up I had was the crispiness of the kaarage, some of the batter/coating was coming off of the chicken breast pieces, but I must say the chicken was very moist.
I don't generally do fried rice since it seems to Americanized to me, but the fried rice is pretty awesome in flavor with some sprinkled seaweed in the mix.
And for dessert we had the honey toast with ice cream...I honestly like this honey toast better than Ichiza's...the correct bread to ice cream ratio was present with a drizzle of chocolate =)....very nicely presented.
The service was great...they came to check on us throughout the meal even though the restaurant was fairly busy due to a graduation party.

This place is better than it looks and the staff is very friendly.
Service is marginal.
Sushi is good.

Love this restaurant!
I have eaten here at least 15 times.
The family who owns this restaurant is from Okinawa, and the sushi and other Japanese food served here is very traditional.
They also have Okinawa nights every 2nd and 4th Friday.
They have a traditional sanshin player and singers during the Okinawa nights with Okinawa Togan soup, pork belly, bitter melon, and other authentic Okinawa dishes.
The family who owns Sato-ya also speak with my sister in Japanese, and they have even helped her with homework!
Love this family and their restaurant!

Don't waste your money!!
Service is friendly but sushi has much to be aspired for....we should have known considering we were the only people there!

I love a good lunch deal!
I had the Trio Deal for $9.95 which comes with Miso soup , salad and rice.
I chose the Chicken Katsu, Tempura and California Rolls.
It was a perfect meal because like always I want a little of everything I'm craving for.
This fit the bill because I wanted chicken , some seafood which some came with the tempura and sushi.
This is a filling meal at a great deal!

I've been to Satoya twice now for takeout, and I have to report they are extremely takeout averse.
This isn't to say the service is rude as every employee I've encountered is extremely friendly, but they clearly don't handle a lot of takeout orders or have simply chosen to not cater those of us who have no friends and whose worst fear is to end up on http://table-for-1.tumblr.com/     The first time was a while back and I ordered one of the lunch specials and an iced green tea.
When I arrived they apologized profusely as they handed me a takeout soup container filled to the brim with tea.
If you've seen my Veggie House review you know this just happened to me there as well.
Is there a shortage of take-out drink cups in the valley or are they crazily expensive or something?
Anyway, I figured it was because at that point they hadn't been open for quite a long time, and the food was fine but not being prepared for such an order makes me feel almost like an inconvenience to them, like maybe they don't want to do these orders (and I NEED my tea).
Fast forward over a year and I was in the mood for sushi at lunch, and still being friendless (in all seriousness I only get 30 minutes, so dine in lunches are almost an impossibility unless I plan for it), I ordered a Sashimi lunch special and again asked for an Iced Tea to go.
When I arrived the waitress said it was ready, but she apologized for not being able to provide me with tea and instead offered me a presumably canned coke/soda instead.
She also explained that the items that come with the lunch special (this one was supposed to come with salad and an Udon soup) were not applicable to takeout.
Let me summarize:  1)  They still haven't purchased to go cups   2) They cannot place a salad into a to-go box   3)  They can't give me the udon soup (maybe they ran out of all the big soup containers for iced tea orders like mine).
She did seem like she felt bad and offered me the opportunity to eat there which I almost accepted so I could get the full value of the meal, but I figured I should head back to work and I swung by starbucks to get myself some tea.
If I was annoyed at anything I thought that maybe they should have let me know of all the limitations over the phone and before I drove there, but I sincerely get the feeling they just don't receive a lot of to-go orders and simply aren't prepared for how to handle it.
Boy this is like the War and Peace of Yelp reviews and I havent even mentioned the food itself.
So the Sashimi and Rice I got were very good, enough for me to still give 3 stars.
There were 2 pieces each of 5 different fish (Salmon, Tuna, Octopus, whitefish and Yellowtail I believe) and they all seemed fresh and flavorful.
I can't say I personally got a great value compared to other Sushi restaurants given the lack of soup and salad (no seriously, they can't box up the salad?!
), but I was still happy with the quality of the fish enough to not completely avoid them in the future.
Now I just need to find some friends to enjoy it dining in next time.

Fresh fish from friendly family owned sushi restaurant.
Weekly visits are part of my lunch circuit.
Prices good too

OK, here is what I think.
If you think sushi at Makino is good - then you may rate 5 stars.
If you only have $15 to spend for sushi, then you will be happy.
If you have been to Kabuto, you may rate this place 2 stars.
If you think you will be getting really good sushi by paying only $10, you are a stupid asshole.
I wanted to avoid eating not-so-good sushi, so, I didn't do happy hour thing.
I paid kinda a lot for ordering a lot of dishes, including Okinawan local food (I heard the owner is from Okinawa), etc.
Big mistake.
Everything was no good.
Sorry, they gotta pump up the food quality to please customers.
So, here is my suggestion - Just go there for their happy hour - you should be fine - at least you won't spend more than $20 - Their happy hour menu is extremely cheap.

I've been going to this restaurant since they opened.
And I'm talking originally opened (back when they were called Kikuhana).
This seriously is the best Japanese place in Vegas.
It is Japanese owned and operated and a family business.
Try finding that at one of the "Japanese" places on the strip.
Or any other Japanese place in Vegas for that matter.
Most places are Korean owned.
Anyway, Satoya is amazing.
The fish is fresh; it arrives fresh daily.
I've never had anything here that's been bad.
Udon is to die for.
Miso is fresh (not from paste or powder).
Best green tea out there made fresh from actual green tea leaves.
They also have special "Okinawa Nights" monthly (usually Friday nights) where they offer a special menu with traditional Okinawa food.
It's a little bit more expensive, but during these special nights you are treated to traditional, live Okinawa music.
Their lunch specials are extremely reasonable ($10 at the high end), and the portions are generous.
Their miso-based salad dressing is seriously the best dressing I've ever had.
They could make a living bottling and selling that alone!
Please give this place a try - you won't be disappointed!

Went here for lunch.
Took over an hour to place our order and get our food.
We had to have the food put in boxes right away.
Only reason I'm giving it two stars is because the Saba was really good.
The sushi should be avoided.

The foods are pretty good, but I was very disappointed when I ordered Chirashi sushi.
I've been to many Sushi restaurants all over the country and Japan and been ordered Chirashi  sushi many times.
Their Chirashi sushi had only one piece of tuna.
Usually, there are AT LEAST two piece or more tuna on Chirashi.
Since I don't care salmon, there were not much to eat.
This is not  the first time I ate this type of Chirashi, the restaurant Inaba also served this type of Chirashi.

Seriously the best Miso soup I have ever had.
The fish is fresh and all the rolls are well made and flavorful.
Strongly recommend it.

Went recently, and the sushi did not seem as fresh as I remember.
I am not sure I would go back.

$20 all you can eat sushi on a Sunday afternoon.
Definitely.
The choices from the all you can eat menu isn't that vast, but it's enough to get your belly bulging and your money's worth.
Sushi chefs I had spoke fluent English and could customize your order.
I ordered green ice tea and thought it lacked flavor and tasted only like water.
I didn't even mention this to the waiter.
I was saying this to my friend, but the waiter heard and fixed the problem.

This review should settle the debate of previous reviewers.
This place has 5 star service, 3 star food and very affordable prices.
For lunch, we ordered salmon teriyaki bento box, crispy rice w/ spicy tuna, japanese ceviche and nabeyaki udon.
The salad dressing was very good, as was the miso soup.
The crispy rice tasted burnt and smoky, although the spicy tuna was very light and tasty, after we took it off the rice.
Avoid the ceviche.
It looks like scraps of leftover sushi in a ponzu bath.
We didn't eat it.
The teriyaki sauce was very good, although the salmon was badly overcooked.
Satoya has good and bad, although I think the bad things are easy to fix.
I'd take the ceviche off the menu and figure a better way to crisp their rice.

This is a good late night sushi place with a late night happy hour.
I had the California roll, salmon roll, and albacore sushi.
The California roll was really good and so was the salmon roll but there was a lot more crab than salmon in the roll.
Honestly, there wasn't a lot of salmon at all.
The albacore sushi didn't taste fresh unfortunately.
Service was great though.
My server was extremely nice.
I would recommend this place for a cheap sushi place but I wouldn't expect much else.
I would like to go back to try the honey toast!

We found Satoya through Yelp.
They are located in a strip mall on Sahara and Rainbow - the location was nothing to write home about, but surprisingly, the food was authentic and delicious (the owners, chefs and servers are actually Japanese unlike so many Japanese restaurants nowadays), the service was very good, and the price was ridiculously affordable.
They have a good menu flanked by a $19.99 all you can eat sushi roll offering that also included kitchen-made items such as yakitori, edamame and other small eats - amazing deal.
Now this is a little known secret: they will actually cater for your party on Saturday & Sunday lunchtime, and anytime on Mondays.
For our baby girl's first birthday, we threw a party at our house and contracted Satoya to prepare sushi for 70 of our guests.
They brought their own equipment and ingredients, and was able to take and prepare custom orders from all of our guests.
Well the food they prepared was a big hit with my guests, and they provided excellent service to everyone.
They even stayed behind to help clean-up the house (so not their responsibility)!
I have returned several times since and have always been impressed by their food and service.
p.s.
Satoya is owned and run by the nicest family from Okinawa.
I just found out yesterday that if you ask for authentic Okinawa cuisine (apparently it's like island food, similar to Hawaiian cuisine), they will prepare it for you (not sure if it's on the menu?).
I'm looking forward to trying that!

Really good and didn't break the bank.
Texas roll was delicious and different because it's topped with beef.
Enjoyed the choose 3 options $14.95 + miso soup or side salad.
Also good: baked crab roll, crispy California, shrimp udon, spicy yellowtail, and chicken karaage.
Happy hour starts at 8pm too and includes some tasty drink options and menu options for $4 or $5.

Satoya is right across the street from were I work so it is super convenient for lunch or dinner.
I use to frequently go to Sushi Mon 1-2 times per week due to location and value but now I go to Satoya.
Every time I come I try to pick something different from one of the different menus they have.
They have AYCE during the evening hours with a limited variety of rolls to pic, but there is other things on the AYCE menu as well like  tofu, yakkitori, beef, edamame, peppers, salad, miso,  I personally dont care for AYCE rolls but my friends love them.
They have another menu that involves picking 3 items+soup&salad for about 14.95 from a list.
This includes many rolls, to a 3 piece nigiri, chicken karage, okinawa soba noodles, fried rice and many others.
There are many lunch specials for around $7-10 .
The service truly shines here.
They are attentive, polite and always greet you with a smile.
A true family owned business that treats everyone wonderfully.
Also they have a decent selection of beer and the honey toast desert is very delicious.

If you appreciate Japanese food you'll appreciate Satoya, if you have an affection for Okinawa style food then you need to try this place.
They had to drag me from this place.
Only complaint was Satoya needs to have a jumbo size for the Okinawa soba.
Spent 20 years appreciating Okinawa and for the last 10 years I've spent trying to find what Satsoya offers, too bad for me I live in Calif. Now I have another reason to visit Las Vegas, it's that good.

This place has pretty good tempura.
They do ayce sushi which includes a pretty decent list, they also do a 3 for $14.95 deal which has a big assortment as well.

I work in the same shopping center as this restaurant but never ate there until today!
I was greeted by the sweetest server, he was really friendly and helpful!
I ordered some Miso soup and an order of edemame (boring, i know!
But im on a diet!
Haha).
The food was brought out very quickly and was really fresh and delicious!
I will definitely be back here soon to check out their tofu options!

Okinawan cuisine!
What a find.
I can't wait for Summer, when Satoya offers Goya chanpuru.
Japanese food is all about "Shun", a peak season for an ingredient, in this case it's Goya, or bitter melon.
While waiting for the shun, I'll eat soki soba here.
Their sushi is also great but if you want to truly appreciate Satoya's potential, try Okinawan cuisine.
Ask the server and you get the idea.

Came in for late happy hour pricing after a UYE.
BF and I opted for a plum wine and the crispy rice with spicy tuna dish from the HH menu, then shared the "pick 3 for $15" special, opting for the salmon skin roll, the Alaska roll, and the shrimp tempura udon.
Special is served with miso soups and salads, both dishes despite menu wording stating soup OR salad.
Sushi quality was decent- fish was fresh and rolls were flavorful and more on the traditional side, but were not rolled very right and as a result a few pieces fell apart.
Soups were both flavorful and noodles were a good portion for the dish.
Favorite order was the crispy rice.
I'd come back and get two or three orders as a meal, which for a dollar a piece isn't bad pricing.
Pieces are large enough to be a couple of bites each, too.
Plum wine was sweet but had a slightly bitter aftertaste, not sure what brand they used but I would not get it with regular pricing.
Server was a young college guy, friendly and cheerful.
Talked a bit about how anxious he was for his semester to end and summer to begin, and we commiserated about the upcoming hot weather that would bring.

Being from Okinawa, it's my go-to place for Okinawa soba.
The staff is always so friendly and the food always delicious.

5 stars for service and 2 stars for the food.
I was hoping to try authentic okinawan food and left disappointed.
I don't recommend ordering sashimi or sushi here as the quality of the fish is mediocre.
My husband enjoyed their simple salmon, spicy tuna, and spicy scallop rolls.
Yellowtail sashimi was not good.
Also tried the shishito peppers and garlic tofu which were good.
Last was the okinawan soba-- noodles itself was great but the broth and pork belly (kind of tough) and extremely bland.
I honestly think if they increased the quality of the produce and corrected the seasonings, they will have more business since their service is fantastic.
