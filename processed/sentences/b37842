I like going to Ali to get my hair done.
Cut, color, add some purple, whatever it might be, she does a great job.
I always feel like I look 10 years younger after she does my hair.
She is always happy to meet my schedule and work me in when I suddenly need help.
I think it's hard to find so many good qualities in a stylist these days.
I think if you try her you will want to become a regular.
I recommend her highly.

I started to go to Ali at Ulta years ago.
There was no question that I'd follow her to Molli Cody's in Scottsdale.
I usually just get a cut.
I've got fairly short hair and it's easy for people to mess it up, but Ali never has.
I get lots of complements afterward ... even from my Mom (a tough critic, hah!).
One of the best things about going to Ali is that she's friendly and flexible and really easy to work with for scheduling, and oh, did i say friendly?
The location is nice, a small and friendly shop.
I recommend Ali highly.
Give her a try!

I met Ali during her time at Ulta.
She became by stylist when my "regular" stylist was running behind and asked if I minded if Ali took care of me that day.
Ali was warm, really listened to what I wanted and did a great job on my hair!
Needless to say the next appointment and from then on I made appointments with Ali.
I followed her to Molli Cody's Hair Studio:) She is a remarkable stylist having cut, colored and permed my hair over the years and each time she on-time, personable and I always leave feeling and looking much better than when I arrived.
She totally works around my schedule - always fitting me in if I need to re-schedule appointment.
She exemplifies professionalism and I am proud to have her as my stylist.
