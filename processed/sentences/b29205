This is a business plan that was always going to work - lingerie and a café.
Both girls and guys are going to love it.
To be fair it is actually really good and is more than just a novelty.
Found in the West End, it is slightly off the main shopping streets but worth the detour.
Primarily it is a lingerie shop, and it has a good selection of pretty, dare I say it rauchy, stuff.
Obviously as a guy, and a non-transvestite, I have a different criteria of what makes underwear hot, and Boobytrap delivers.
Not quite as provocative (let's be frank slutty) as Ann Summers, think more La Senza - sexy but with a touch more class.
No crotchless knickers here or nipple tassles.
As well as this, we have the unusual addition of a café.
Whether all the raunchiness has left you feeling a bit weak at the knee, or are a girl chatting about what to buy, or simply a guy way way out of his depth, the café is a place to chill out.
They do a good range of teas, coffees and sandwiches which you can enjoy before heading off for round two.
An individul and enjoyable place to spend about half an hour, whether as a couple or on your own (buying gifts, not perving - I am not endorsing this).
