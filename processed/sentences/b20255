A greasy spoon at the rear end of Leith Walk is a welcome addition.
There are plenty of  specialist cafes but none that serve normal food.
The decor in this place is a little basic but the place is religiously clean.
Grabbed a bacon roll on a lunch break and it was exactly how I imagined it would be.
Got a cup of tea after words and it was the same affair.
Nothing new, nothing special, but that's exactly what I needed at the time.

Good old full Scottish breakfasts and more in a no-nonsense, friendly setting.
Service with a smile, too, which makes a welcome difference!
Lovely tatty scones :)
