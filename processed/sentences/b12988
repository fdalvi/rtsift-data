My favorite soul food joint in Vegas!!
Very small restaurant with a simple decor.
The best seafood gumbo I have had in a very long time.
Catfish is always fresh and the cornbread is pipin' hot!!
Make sure to check out the live jazz bands throughout the week!!
Perfect setting for a glass of wine, good food and great music!
