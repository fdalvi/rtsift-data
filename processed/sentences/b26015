Great place for over all office and school supplies.
Great selection of writing pens.
Found great deal on HP injet photo paper with 50 sheets only $1 after mail in rebate, so for photo shop and scrapbooking fans, stock up and save.

If you're in need of some quick office supplies this is a quick place to grab all of those things .....but at a price.
I defiantly would do research before buying a computer here as you may find almost anywhere else is cheaper than this place but other than that if you NEED something for your home or office then here is your store!

Ruined a poster I sent in to laminate on a display.
Tried to slip it by me.
They did not even offer any remuneration for their poor service.
I would not use their printing and services aain.

If you need to use a fax machine, this is your place to go.
I've only been here several times for ink and to use their fax machine.
Their back to school sales are pretty awesome, so i usually only shop here during late summer/early fall.

Their sign says they close at 7 but I needed to stop in at 645 to grab some ink....
I knew exactly which one I needed but they had already locked the doors????????
Uhhh... Change your hours then so I don't have to think your open until a certain time when you really aren't....
