I purchased a S&W rifle as a gift and had it shipped here.
Shane was very friendly and helpful, taking the time to answer a bunch of my questions.
One thing that stood out: I expected the delivery to arrive on a Thursday, but USPS was late.
I sent Shane a text after hours to double-check that it hadn't arrived and Shane responded that same night.
Pretty cool.
Anyway, I learned a lot from the visit and will definitely be back.

Have used Shane three times in the past several months, he's great.
Professional, knowledgable and more than fair priced.
All around squared away, stand-up guy, I wouldn't use anyone else.

I ordered an S&W MP15 and and AK and had it delivered to pick up from here.
All went well and quickly.
Will use again

An odd location for an FFL, in one half of a barbershop, but Shane has always done me right.
Over the course of at least 4 transactions, he has always been perfectly transparent with communication and smoothly gotten me out the door.
All while being affordable.
I highly recommend Shane if are anywhere in the near vicinity!
