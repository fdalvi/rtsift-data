I am a return client, Awesome services!

Excellent Brazilian!
I admit that I was a bit hesitant about seeing a male aesthetician, but Dale immediately put me at ease and treated me with as much, if not more, professionalism than some females that I have seen for the same service.
The appointment was not rushed and the end result is fantastic.
I look forward to going back next month.

At 28 years old, I thought I'd take the final plunge and get a Brazilian wax for the first time.
I found this place through Groupon and am extremely glad that I did!
Dale is extremely comfortable to be around.
I couldn't have had a better first experience.
He kept my focus during the most painful parts which helped quite a lot.
There was nice relaxing music playing in the background and a sense of security in the way he carried himself.
There was no rush to get me out the door so the job was done right.
I couldn't have asked for a better experience and will definitely be going back.

I received a 'giftcard' here from my work and scheduled my appointment for an osmosis facial.
I had never had a facial before and I was also nervous about doing something like this with an unfamiliar male.
Dale was very professional and made me feel very at ease.
I learned a little bit about why he decided to go into skincare and that he had daughters close to my age.
We talked about the other treatments he offers, and how confident he is in the products he uses.
He doesn't believe in using acids and most of his products are organic and from the ocean.
I noticed the results from my osmosis facial the next day!
Why haven't I done something like this sooner?
I will definitely come back.
