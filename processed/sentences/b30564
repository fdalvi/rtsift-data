Please do not visit this "spa!
" The "swedish massage" I received was a lady simply rubbing oil all over my body.
She didn't work into any of my muscles and her draping techniques were extremely inappropriate.
I receive massages on a very regular basis and have never felt so violated during a treatment.
The lady also informed me that she has been performing "swedish massages" under her aesthetics license and isn't actually licensed in massage -yikes!

I also have had too many bad services here.
My first Swedish massage was a simple oil application and she didn't even touch my hands or feet.
What Massage doesnt include feet.
Then I had a "facial" where she cleanses my face, put on an exfoliating mask then a moisturizer.
There were a lot of steps missed.
And my hour facial was turned into 30 min.
She also made comments to me about my skin which I felt were rude.
I returned in about a month due to the package I had and the massage was better but I had to ask For my feet to be done and I had the exfoliating add on which entails a dry sponge like thing used on the body.
She didn't do my whole body and It was a waste of money.
Then the facial, I added a peel because I knew I wasn't going to get a real facial and long story short she didn't cleanse my face well and used something that caused me To break out.
No extractions done nothing.
I too wondered about the licenses and if there was any real training.
For the record I am a licensed professional familiar with what the services should have been like.
Find another spot.

I have never been here but A for Alexandra should know if she is a licensed professional that not all massages are the same.
I'm an LMT and a foot massage isn't ALWAYS performed in a swedish massage.
In fact, I usually NEVER work on someone's feet unless they specifically as for it.
