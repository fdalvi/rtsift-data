These guys do such a great job with event security, cleanup, and organization.
Every year I attend the Waste Management Open, they make our experience in the Bird's Nest VIP and corporate cabanas top notch.
Their staff is well trained and understands the flow of a large event.
They not only handle the WMO, but several larger events in the Valley.
Each time, my experience with them is great.
Kudos to their events team!

I worked with RJ in planning and executing an event held this past weekend.
He was prompt, professional, and extremely knowledgable.
Beyond that, I felt confident he had my and the client's best interest in mind.
There was no pushing of unnecessary add-ons onto us - he gave his honest opinion and therefore instilled trust in me as a future client.
Though he was unable to attend the actual set-up, I received check-in calls throughout the day, and was assured that if anything needed tweaking, they would edit accordingly, no matter what it took.
As an event planner, I've found that degree of flexibility to be rare.
I will use his services for every event from here, forward.
