We recently switched to State Farm after working with our previous insurance company for many years mainly because the price quote we received was better than what we had.
The service provided by this insurance agent was impeccable.
We met with them or talked with them on the phone numerous times and they were always friendly and very helpful.
If they could not answer a question immediately, they would find out the answer and get back to us in a timely manner.
The entire staff is welcoming and accommodating.
I would highly recommend using them if you are looking for a service oriented insurance agent.

My husband and I were with another well known insurance company for 9 years.
I finally did some research and reached out to Cheryl Hasson who was highly recommended by a friend.
I figured State Farm wouldn't be able to provide my family a better rate especially after being loyal to another company for so long.
To my surprise, Cheryl was able to save my family $60 per month for the exact same policy.
On top of that, Cheryl never made me feel like I was just a new policy number.
I was a valued customer whose time was respected and my business is appreciated.
I am so thankful I received this referral and I would refer Cheryl Hasson with State Farm to anyone.
Thank you, Cheryl.

I have worked with many insurance agents during my career, and I can say that Cheryl and her team are some of the best.
They are the upmost professional to work with.
I appreciate Cheryl's honesty and integrity - something you don't always see in other insurance agents.
