Better than Wal-mart.
A little dingy though.

This Kmart located at 35th Ave & Greenway has been here for years and honestly with Sears closing stores every year I can't believe this Kmart is still open.
However, I am glad it is as I have joined their shoppers reward program where you earn points on your purchases including prescriptions.
I love their bonus points offers that are printed on their receipts and sometimes advertised in their weekly ads.
For example, an offer might be make a purchase of $50 and earn 10,000 bonus points.
10,000 points equals $10!
Prescriptions are 500 points for every prescription filled.
500 points equals .50 cents.
Shop Your Way Rewards gives you points that are actually cash to use for later purchases you can't beat that.
Plus the fact that Kmart still offers lay-away year around uh yah I'm a fan !

This Kmart is bigger and much cleaner.
Same great deals with the Shop Your Way Rewards program.
If you like shopping Kmart this location is legit.

Prices miss marked  did not honor prices  A mess of everything  Racist remarks when I was speaking proper English he still asked me if I wanted a Spanish application  I will never go to that location and I will make sure to never recommend anyone there
