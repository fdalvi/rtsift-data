I came to this family-owned business (some years ago), located behind 7-11 in the little strip mall, several times for jewelry repair (it was close to work at the time).
I have a beautiful white gold diamond bracelet from Zales that has a clasp which keeps coming loose.
(In fact, it's loose again.
) The owners are brothers, who are very nice, and they do quality work.
It's a small store- you get buzzed in, for obvious security reasons.
I do remember seeing some lovely tanzanite jewelry (one of my favorites but it's pricey).

I needed to fix a silver link on my wife's necklace.
I found the store inYelp near my location.
I walked in, they fixed it in 5 mins and I was out the door very pleased.

Lou does amazing work and quality repairs.
Pricing is transparant and fair.
